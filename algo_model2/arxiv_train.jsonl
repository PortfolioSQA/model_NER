{"text": "  This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning (PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO."}
{"text": "  We introduce a framework for filtering features that employs the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a measure of dependence between the features and the labels. The key idea is that good features should maximise such dependence. Feature selection for various supervised learning problems (including classification and regression) is unified under this framework, and the solutions can be approximated using a backward-elimination algorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on both artificial and real world datasets."}
{"text": "  Speaker identification is a powerful, non-invasive and in-expensive biometric technique. The recognition accuracy, however, deteriorates when noise levels affect a specific band of frequency. In this paper, we present a sub-band based speaker identification that intends to improve the live testing performance. Each frequency sub-band is processed and classified independently. We also compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the non-linear merging techniques that are investigated. Results showed that the sub-band based method used with linear merging techniques enormously improved the performance of the speaker identification over the performance of wide-band recognizers when tested live. A live testing improvement of 9.78% was achieved"}

{"text": "  The distance metric plays an important role in nearest neighbor (NN) classification. Usually the Euclidean distance metric is assumed or a Mahalanobis distance metric is optimized to improve the NN performance. In this paper, we study the problem of embedding arbitrary metric spaces into a Euclidean space with the goal to improve the accuracy of the NN classifier. We propose a solution by appealing to the framework of regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and prove a representer-like theorem for NN classification. The embedding function is then determined by solving a semidefinite program which has an interesting connection to the soft-margin linear binary support vector machine classifier. Although the main focus of this paper is to present a general, theoretical framework for metric embedding in a NN setting, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on some benchmark datasets and show that it performs better than the Mahalanobis metric learning algorithm in terms of leave-one-out and generalization errors."}
{"text": "  Bounds on the risk play a crucial role in statistical learning theory. They usually involve as capacity measure of the model studied the VC dimension or one of its extensions. In classification, such \"VC dimensions\" exist for models taking values in {0, 1}, {1,..., Q} and R. We introduce the generalizations appropriate for the missing case, the one of models with values in R^Q. This provides us with a new guaranteed risk for M-SVMs which appears superior to the existing one."}
{"text": "  We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied."}
{"text": "  Dendrograms used in data analysis are ultrametric spaces, hence objects of nonarchimedean geometry. It is known that there exist $p$-adic representation of dendrograms. Completed by a point at infinity, they can be viewed as subtrees of the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the $p$-adic projective line. The implications are that certain moduli spaces known in algebraic geometry are $p$-adic parameter spaces of (families of) dendrograms, and stochastic classification can also be handled within this framework. At the end, we calculate the topology of the hidden part of a dendrogram."}
{"text": "  A conceptual framework for cluster analysis from the viewpoint of p-adic geometry is introduced by describing the space of all dendrograms for n datapoints and relating it to the moduli space of p-adic Riemannian spheres with punctures using a method recently applied by Murtagh (2004b). This method embeds a dendrogram as a subtree into the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the p-adic numbers, and goes back to Cornelissen et al. (2001) in p-adic geometry. After explaining the definitions, the concept of classifiers is discussed in the context of moduli spaces, and upper bounds for the number of hidden vertices in dendrograms are given."}
{"text": "  Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output or label space $\\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\\CX$, given a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\\CX \\times \\CY$. However, in a lot of applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy, while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to deal with this problem is {\\em active} learning, where points to be labelled are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a) optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related field of active learning."}
{"text": "  The method of defensive forecasting is applied to the problem of prediction with expert advice for binary outcomes. It turns out that defensive forecasting is not only competitive with the Aggregating Algorithm but also handles the case of \"second-guessing\" experts, whose advice depends on the learner's prediction; this paper assumes that the dependence on the learner's prediction is continuous."}
{"text": "  Defensive forecasting is a method of transforming laws of probability (stated in game-theoretic terms as strategies for Sceptic) into forecasting algorithms. There are two known varieties of defensive forecasting: \"continuous\", in which Sceptic's moves are assumed to depend on the forecasts in a (semi)continuous manner and which produces deterministic forecasts, and \"randomized\", in which the dependence of Sceptic's moves on the forecasts is arbitrary and Forecaster's moves are allowed to be randomized. This note shows that the randomized variety can be obtained from the continuous variety by smearing Sceptic's moves to make them continuous."}
{"text": "  We present and analyse three online algorithms for learning in discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and compare them with the Baldi-Chauvin Algorithm. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of generalisation error we draw learning curves in simplified situations. The performance for learning drifting concepts of one of the presented algorithms is analysed and compared with the Baldi-Chauvin algorithm in the same situations. A brief discussion about learning and symmetry breaking based on our results is also presented."}
{"text": "  In recent years, kernel density estimation has been exploited by computer scientists to model machine learning problems. The kernel density estimation based approaches are of interest due to the low time complexity of either O(n) or O(n*log(n)) for constructing a classifier, where n is the number of sampling instances. Concerning design of kernel density estimators, one essential issue is how fast the pointwise mean square error (MSE) and/or the integrated mean square error (IMSE) diminish as the number of sampling instances increases. In this article, it is shown that with the proposed kernel function it is feasible to make the pointwise MSE of the density estimator converge at O(n^-2/3) regardless of the dimension of the vector space, provided that the probability density function at the point of interest meets certain conditions."}
{"text": "  This thesis responds to the challenges of using a large number, such as thousands, of features in regression and classification problems.   There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and mixture models.   High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models.   We use both simulated data and real data to test our methods in both chapters."}
{"text": "  Simulated annealing is a popular method for approaching the solution of a global optimization problem. Existing results on its performance apply to discrete combinatorial optimization where the optimization variables can assume only a finite set of possible values. We introduce a new general formulation of simulated annealing which allows one to guarantee finite-time performance in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. The results hold universally for any optimization problem on a bounded domain and establish a connection between simulated annealing and up-to-date theory of convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on continuous domains. This work is inspired by the concept of finite-time learning with known accuracy and confidence developed in statistical learning theory."}
{"text": "  We show that the Brier game of prediction is mixable and find the optimal learning rate and substitution function for it. The resulting prediction algorithm is applied to predict results of football and tennis matches. The theoretical performance guarantee turns out to be rather tight on these data sets, especially in the case of the more extensive tennis data."}
{"text": "  We present the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP), a stochastic process which assigns probability distributions to infinitely-deep, infinitely-branching trees. We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian nonparametric model of document collections. Specifically, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientific abstracts from several journals. This model exemplifies a recent trend in statistical machine learning--the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on flexible data structures."}
{"text": "  Regularization by the sum of singular values, also referred to as the trace norm, is a popular technique for estimating low rank rectangular matrices. In this paper, we extend some of the consistency results of the Lasso to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for rank consistency of trace norm minimization with the square loss. We also provide an adaptive version that is rank consistent even when the necessary condition for the non adaptive version is not fulfilled."}
{"text": "  We provide self-contained proof of a theorem relating probabilistic coherence of forecasts to their non-domination by rival forecasts with respect to any proper scoring rule. The theorem appears to be new but is closely related to results achieved by other investigators."}
{"text": "  Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets."}
{"text": "  We characterize and study variable importance (VIMP) and pairwise variable associations in binary regression trees. A key component involves the node mean squared error for a quantity we refer to as a maximal subtree. The theory naturally extends from single trees to ensembles of trees and applies to methods like random forests. This is useful because while importance values from random forests are used to screen variables, for example they are used to filter high throughput genomic data in Bioinformatics, very little theory exists about their properties."}
{"text": "  Recent spectral clustering methods are a propular and powerful technique for data clustering. These methods need to solve the eigenproblem whose computational complexity is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data samples. In this paper, a non-eigenproblem based clustering method is proposed to deal with the clustering problem. Its performance is comparable to the spectral clustering algorithms but it is more efficient with computational complexity $O(n^2)$. We show that with a transitive distance and an observed property, called K-means duality, our algorithm can be used to handle data sets with complex cluster shapes, multi-scale clusters, and noise. Moreover, no parameters except the number of clusters need to be set in our algorithm."}
{"text": "  Covariances from categorical variables are defined using a regular simplex expression for categories. The method follows the variance definition by Gini, and it gives the covariance as a solution of simultaneous equations. The calculated results give reasonable values for test data. A method of principal component analysis (RS-PCA) is also proposed using regular simplex expressions, which allows easy interpretation of the principal components. The proposed methods apply to variable selection problem of categorical data USCensus1990 data. The proposed methods give appropriate criterion for the variable selection problem of categorical"}
{"text": "  For a classification problem described by the joint density $P(\\omega,x)$, models of $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ (the ``Bayesian similarity measure'') have been shown to be an optimal similarity measure for nearest neighbor classification. This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties of that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can reconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\\omega|x)$ given $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class labels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves Bayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class posterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper identifies a distinct class of classification problems using $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ to solve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution."}
{"text": "  This monograph deals with adaptive supervised classification, using tools borrowed from statistical mechanics and information theory, stemming from the PACBayesian approach pioneered by David McAllester and applied to a conception of statistical learning theory forged by Vladimir Vapnik. Using convex analysis on the set of posterior probability measures, we show how to get local measures of the complexity of the classification model involving the relative entropy of posterior distributions with respect to Gibbs posterior measures. We then discuss relative bounds, comparing the generalization error of two classification rules, showing how the margin assumption of Mammen and Tsybakov can be replaced with some empirical measure of the covariance structure of the classification model.We show how to associate to any posterior distribution an effective temperature relating it to the Gibbs prior distribution with the same level of expected error rate, and how to estimate this effective temperature from data, resulting in an estimator whose expected error rate converges according to the best possible power of the sample size adaptively under any margin and parametric complexity assumptions. We describe and study an alternative selection scheme based on relative bounds between estimators, and present a two step localization technique which can handle the selection of a parametric model from a family of those. We show how to extend systematically all the results obtained in the inductive setting to transductive learning, and use this to improve Vapnik's generalization bounds, extending them to the case when the sample is made of independent non-identically distributed pairs of patterns and labels. Finally we review briefly the construction of Support Vector Machines and show how to derive generalization bounds for them, measuring the complexity either through the number of support vectors or through the value of the transductive or inductive margin."}
{"text": "  Learning machines which have hierarchical structures or hidden variables are singular statistical models because they are nonidentifiable and their Fisher information matrices are singular. In singular statistical models, neither the Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the maximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main reason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances from trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes generalization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error, and (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations among these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states in statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any parametric model, and any a priori distribution. Also we show that Bayes and Gibbs generalization errors are estimated by Bayes and Gibbs training errors, and propose widely applicable information criteria which can be applied to both regular and singular statistical models."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of choosing a density estimate from a set of distributions F, minimizing the L1-distance to an unknown distribution (Devroye, Lugosi 2001). Devroye and Lugosi analyze two algorithms for the problem: Scheffe tournament winner and minimum distance estimate. The Scheffe tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.   We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The first one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same number (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament. The second one, called ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' uses only a linear number of computations, assuming that F is preprocessed.   We also give examples showing that the guarantees of the algorithms cannot be improved and explore randomized algorithms for density estimation."}
{"text": "  Point clouds are sets of points in two or three dimensions. Most kernel methods for learning on sets of points have not yet dealt with the specific geometrical invariances and practical constraints associated with point clouds in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we present extensions of graph kernels for point clouds, which allow to use kernel methods for such ob jects as shapes, line drawings, or any three-dimensional point clouds. In order to design rich and numerically efficient kernels with as few free parameters as possible, we use kernels between covariance matrices and their factorizations on graphical models. We derive polynomial time dynamic programming recursions and present applications to recognition of handwritten digits and Chinese characters from few training examples."}

{"text": "  Given R groups of numerical variables X1, ... XR, we assume that each group is the result of one underlying latent variable, and that all latent variables are bound together through a linear equation system. Moreover, we assume that some explanatory latent variables may interact pairwise in one or more equations. We basically consider PLS Path Modelling's algorithm to estimate both latent variables and the model's coefficients. New \"external\" estimation schemes are proposed that draw latent variables towards strong group structures in a more flexible way. New \"internal\" estimation schemes are proposed to enable PLSPM to make good use of variable group complementarity and to deal with interactions. Application examples are given."}
{"text": "  We present a general approach for collaborative filtering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators from \"users\" to the \"objects\" they rate. Recent low-rank type matrix completion approaches to CF are shown to be special cases. However, unlike existing regularization based CF methods, our approach can be used to also incorporate information such as attributes of the users or the objects -- a limitation of existing regularization based CF methods. We then provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions, and test them on a standard CF dataset. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Dimensionality reduction is a topic of recent interest. In this paper, we present the classification constrained dimensionality reduction (CCDR) algorithm to account for label information. The algorithm can account for multiple classes as well as the semi-supervised setting. We present an out-of-sample expressions for both labeled and unlabeled data. For unlabeled data, we introduce a method of embedding a new point as preprocessing to a classifier. For labeled data, we introduce a method that improves the embedding during the training phase using the out-of-sample extension. We investigate classification performance using the CCDR algorithm on hyper-spectral satellite imagery data. We demonstrate the performance gain for both local and global classifiers and demonstrate a 10% improvement of the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm performance. We present a connection between intrinsic dimension estimation and the optimal embedding dimension obtained using the CCDR algorithm."}
{"text": "  Being among the easiest ways to find meaningful structure from discrete data, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and related component models have been applied widely. They are simple, computationally fast and scalable, interpretable, and admit nonparametric priors. In the currently popular field of network modeling, relatively little work has taken uncertainty of data seriously in the Bayesian sense, and component models have been introduced to the field only recently, by treating each node as a bag of out-going links. We introduce an alternative, interaction component model for communities (ICMc), where the whole network is a bag of links, stemming from different components. The former finds both disassortative and assortative structure, while the alternative assumes assortativity and finds community-like structures like the earlier methods motivated by physics. With Dirichlet Process priors and an efficient implementation the models are highly scalable, as demonstrated with a social network from the Last.fm web site, with 670,000 nodes and 1.89 million links."}
{"text": "  We propose to investigate test statistics for testing homogeneity in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Asymptotic null distributions under null hypothesis are derived, and consistency against fixed and local alternatives is assessed.

{"text": "  When using the K-nearest neighbors method, one often ignores uncertainty in the choice of K. To account for such uncertainty, Holmes and Adams (2002) proposed a Bayesian framework for K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Their Bayesian KNN (BKNN) approach uses a pseudo-likelihood function, and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to draw posterior samples. Holmes and Adams (2002) focused on the performance of BKNN in terms of misclassification error but did not assess its ability to quantify uncertainty. We present some evidence to show that BKNN still significantly underestimates model uncertainty."}
{"text": "  Flow cytometry is often used to characterize the malignant cells in leukemia and lymphoma patients, traced to the level of the individual cell. Typically, flow cytometric data analysis is performed through a series of 2-dimensional projections onto the axes of the data set. Through the years, clinicians have determined combinations of different fluorescent markers which generate relatively known expression patterns for specific subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma -- cancers of the hematopoietic system. By only viewing a series of 2-dimensional projections, the high-dimensional nature of the data is rarely exploited. In this paper we present a means of determining a low-dimensional projection which maintains the high-dimensional relationships (i.e. information) between differing oncological data sets. By using machine learning techniques, we allow clinicians to visualize data in a low dimension defined by a linear combination of all of the available markers, rather than just 2 at a time. This provides an aid in diagnosing similar forms of cancer, as well as a means for variable selection in exploratory flow cytometric research. We refer to our method as Information Preserving Component Analysis (IPCA)."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of learning k-juntas given access to examples drawn from a number of different product distributions. Thus we wish to learn a function f : {-1,1}^n -> {-1,1} that depends on k (unknown) coordinates. While the best known algorithms for the general problem of learning a k-junta require running time of n^k * poly(n,2^k), we show that given access to k different product distributions with biases separated by \\gamma>0, the functions may be learned in time poly(n,2^k,\\gamma^{-k}). More generally, given access to t <= k different product distributions, the functions may be learned in time n^{k/t} * poly(n,2^k,\\gamma^{-k}). Our techniques involve novel results in Fourier analysis relating Fourier expansions with respect to different biases and a generalization of Russo's formula."}

This paper compares the use of a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network and a new Relational Network on classifying the HIV status of women at ante-natal clinics. The paper discusses the architecture of the relational network and its merits compared to a neural network and most other computational intelligence classifiers. Results gathered from the study indicate comparable classification accuracies as well as revealed relationships between data features in the classification data. Much higher classification accuracies are recommended for future research in the area of HIV classification as well as missing data estimation."}
{"text": "  This paper aims to showcase the measure of structural diversity of an ensemble of 9 classifiers and then map a relationship between this structural diversity and accuracy. The structural diversity was induced by having different architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical Algorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the classification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9 classifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to aggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a diversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024 as maximum diversity measured. The parameters that were varied were: the number of hidden nodes, learning rate and the activation function."}
{"text": "  Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters: the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the 2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2, as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established."}
{"text": "  This article considers constrained $\\ell_1$ minimization methods for the recovery of high dimensional sparse signals in three settings: noiseless, bounded error and Gaussian noise. A unified and elementary treatment is given in these noise settings for two $\\ell_1$ minimization methods: the Dantzig selector and $\\ell_1$ minimization with an $\\ell_2$ constraint. The results of this paper improve the existing results in the literature by weakening the conditions and tightening the error bounds. The improvement on the conditions shows that signals with larger support can be recovered accurately. This paper also establishes connections between restricted isometry property and the mutual incoherence property. Some results of Candes, Romberg and Tao (2006) and Donoho, Elad, and Temlyakov (2006) are extended."}

{"text": "  We identify the classical Perceptron algorithm with margin as a member of a broader family of large margin classifiers which we collectively call the Margitron. The Margitron, (despite its) sharing the same update rule with the Perceptron, is shown in an incremental setting to converge in a finite number of updates to solutions possessing any desirable fraction of the maximum margin. Experiments comparing the Margitron with decomposition SVMs on tasks involving linear kernels and 2-norm soft margin are also reported."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sample selection bias correction. The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability. Much of our work and proof techniques can be used to analyze other importance weighting techniques and their effect on accuracy when using a distributionally stable algorithm."}
{"text": "  This article describes an approach to designing a distributed and modular neural classifier. This approach introduces a new hierarchical clustering that enables one to determine reliable regions in the representation space by exploiting supervised information. A multilayer perceptron is then associated with each of these detected clusters and charged with recognizing elements of the associated cluster while rejecting all others. The obtained global classifier is comprised of a set of cooperating neural networks and completed by a K-nearest neighbor classifier charged with treating elements rejected by all the neural networks. Experimental results for the handwritten digit recognition problem and comparison with neural and statistical nonmodular classifiers are given."}

{"text": "  We analyze the performance of a class of manifold-learning algorithms that find their output by minimizing a quadratic form under some normalization constraints. This class consists of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Laplacian Eigenmap, Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE), and Diffusion maps. We present and prove conditions on the manifold that are necessary for the success of the algorithms. Both the finite sample case and the limit case are analyzed. We show that there are simple manifolds in which the necessary conditions are violated, and hence the algorithms cannot recover the underlying manifolds.

The measure also serves as a natural tool when choosing dimension-reduction parameters. We also present two novel dimension-reduction techniques that attempt to minimize the suggested measure, and compare the results of these techniques to the results of existing algorithms. Finally, we suggest a simple iterative method that can be used to improve the output of existing algorithms."}
{"text": "  The problem of supervised classification (or discrimination) with functional data is considered, with a special interest on the popular k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. First, relying on a recent result by Cerou and Guyader (2006), we prove the consistency of the k-NN classifier for functional data whose distribution belongs to a broad family of Gaussian processes with triangular covariance functions. Second, on a more practical side, we check the behavior of the k-NN method when compared with a few other functional classifiers. This is carried out through a small simulation study and the analysis of several real functional data sets. While no global \"uniform\" winner emerges from such comparisons, the overall performance of the k-NN method, together with its sound intuitive motivation and relative simplicity, suggests that it could represent a reasonable benchmark for the classification problem with functional data."}
{"text": "  Statistical learning theory chiefly studies restricted hypothesis classes, particularly those with finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. The fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity: the number of samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy. Here we consider learning over the set of all computable labeling functions. Since the VC-dimension is infinite and a priori (uniform) bounds on the number of samples are impossible, we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen sufficient samples to have learned. We first show that learning in this setting is indeed possible, and develop a learning algorithm. We then show, however, that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is impossible. Notably, this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that the learning algorithm be computable, and not due to the statistical nature of the problem."}
{"text": "  We propose a new sparsity-smoothness penalty for high-dimensional generalized additive models. The combination of sparsity and smoothness is crucial for mathematical theory as well as performance for finite-sample data. We present a computationally efficient algorithm, with provable numerical convergence properties, for optimizing the penalized likelihood. Furthermore, we provide oracle results which yield asymptotic optimality of our estimator for high dimensional but sparse additive models. Finally, an adaptive version of our sparsity-smoothness penalized approach yields large additional performance gains."}
{"text": "  We prove that the class of functions g:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1} that only depend on an unknown subset of k<<n variables (so-called k-juntas) is agnostically learnable from a random walk in time polynomial in n, 2^{k^2}, epsilon^{-k}, and log(1/delta). In other words, there is an algorithm with the claimed running time that, given epsilon, delta > 0 and access to a random walk on {-1,+1}^n labeled by an arbitrary function f:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1}, finds with probability at least 1-delta a k-junta that is (opt(f)+epsilon)-close to f, where opt(f) denotes the distance of a closest k-junta to f."}
{"text": "  The method of stable random projections is a tool for efficiently computing the $l_\\alpha$ distances using low memory, where $0<\\alpha \\leq 2$ is a tuning parameter. The method boils down to a statistical estimation task and various estimators have been proposed, based on the geometric mean, the harmonic mean, and the fractional power etc.   This study proposes the optimal quantile estimator, whose main operation is selecting, which is considerably less expensive than taking fractional power, the main operation in previous estimators. Our experiments report that the optimal quantile estimator is nearly one order of magnitude more computationally efficient than previous estimators. For large-scale learning tasks in which storing and computing pairwise distances is a serious bottleneck, this estimator should be desirable.   In addition to its computational advantages, the optimal quantile estimator exhibits nice theoretical properties. It is more accurate than previous estimators when $\\alpha>1$. We derive its theoretical error bounds and establish the explicit (i.e., no hidden constants) sample complexity bound."}
{"text": "  Applications in machine learning and data mining require computing pairwise Lp distances in a data matrix A. For massive high-dimensional data, computing all pairwise distances of A can be infeasible. In fact, even storing A or all pairwise distances of A in the memory may be also infeasible. This paper proposes a simple method for p = 2, 4, 6, ... We first decompose the l_p (where p is even) distances into a sum of 2 marginal norms and p-1 ``inner products'' at different orders. Then we apply normal or sub-Gaussian random projections to approximate the resultant ``inner products,'' assuming that the marginal norms can be computed exactly by a linear scan. We propose two strategies for applying random projections. The basic projection strategy requires only one projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative projection strategy requires p-1 projection matrices but its theoretical analysis is much easier. In terms of the accuracy, at least for p=4, the basic strategy is always more accurate than the alternative strategy if the data are non-negative, which is common in reality."}
{"text": "  We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random walk graph kernel \\citep{GaeFlaWro03,BorOngSchVisetal05}, marginalized graph kernel \\citep{KasTsuIno03,KasTsuIno04,MahUedAkuPeretal04}, and geometric kernel on graphs \\citep{Gaertner02}. Through extensions of linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and reduction to a Sylvester equation, we construct an algorithm that improves the time complexity of kernel computation from $O(n^6)$ to $O(n^3)$. When the graphs are sparse, conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations bring our algorithm into the sub-cubic domain. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that it is often more than a thousand times faster than previous approaches. We then explore connections between diffusion kernels \\citep{KonLaf02}, regularization on graphs \\citep{SmoKon03}, and graph kernels, and use these connections to propose new graph kernels. Finally, we show that rational kernels \\citep{CorHafMoh02,CorHafMoh03,CorHafMoh04} when specialized to graphs reduce to the random walk graph kernel."}
{"text": "  We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees. First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked trees."}
{"text": "  We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a positive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to non-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive combination of individually representable observations is also representable by the network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We present a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation data which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate their potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source separation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our results illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple simultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also present results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are extracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be useful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also propose a network for language modeling."}
{"text": "  The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the input. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and linear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional neighborhood representation."}
{"text": "  We construct a framework for studying clustering algorithms, which includes two key ideas: persistence and functoriality. The first encodes the idea that the output of a clustering scheme should carry a multiresolution structure, the second the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme, stability and convergence are established."}
{"text": "  We consider principal component analysis (PCA) in decomposable Gaussian graphical models. We exploit the prior information in these models in order to distribute its computation. For this purpose, we reformulate the problem in the sparse inverse covariance (concentration) domain and solve the global eigenvalue problem using a sequence of local eigenvalue problems in each of the cliques of the decomposable graph. We demonstrate the application of our methodology in the context of decentralized anomaly detection in the Abilene backbone network. Based on the topology of the network, we propose an approximate statistical graphical model and distribute the computation of PCA."}
{"text": "  We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the {\\em representer theorem}, is at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, thereby completing the characterization of kernel methods based on regularization. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing function."}
{"text": "  In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may benefit from the others. In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non convex methods dedicated to the same problem."}
{"text": "  We consider the task of learning a classifier from the feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ to the set of classes $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{0, 1\\}$, when the features can be partitioned into class-conditionally independent feature sets $\\mathcal{X}_1$ and $\\mathcal{X}_2$. We show the surprising fact that the class-conditional independence can be used to represent the original learning task in terms of 1) learning a classifier from $\\mathcal{X}_2$ to $\\mathcal{X}_1$ and 2) learning the class-conditional distribution of the feature set $\\mathcal{X}_1$. This fact can be exploited for semi-supervised learning because the former task can be accomplished purely from unlabeled samples. We present experimental evaluation of the idea in two real world applications."}
{"text": "  Many problems of low-level computer vision and image processing, such as denoising, deconvolution, tomographic reconstruction or super-resolution, can be addressed by maximizing the posterior distribution of a sparse linear model (SLM). We show how higher-order Bayesian decision-making problems, such as optimizing image acquisition in magnetic resonance scanners, can be addressed by querying the SLM posterior covariance, unrelated to the density's mode. We propose a scalable algorithmic framework, with which SLM posteriors over full, high-resolution images can be approximated for the first time, solving a variational optimization problem which is convex iff posterior mode finding is convex. These methods successfully drive the optimization of sampling trajectories for real-world magnetic resonance imaging through Bayesian experimental design, which has not been attempted before. Our methodology provides new insight into similarities and differences between sparse reconstruction and approximate Bayesian inference, and has important implications for compressive sensing of real-world images."}
{"text": "  We present a new online boosting algorithm for adapting the weights of a boosted classifier, which yields a closer approximation to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm than previous online boosting algorithms. We also contribute a new way of deriving the online algorithm that ties together previous online boosting work. We assume that the weak hypotheses were selected beforehand, and only their weights are updated during online boosting. The update rule is derived by minimizing AdaBoost's loss when viewed in an incremental form. The equations show that optimization is computationally expensive. However, a fast online approximation is possible. We compare approximation error to batch AdaBoost on synthetic datasets and generalization error on face datasets and the MNIST dataset."}
{"text": "  Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) and its variants have been very successful in embedding data-manifolds in lower dimensional spaces, often revealing the true intrinsic dimension. In this paper we show how to also incorporate supervised class information into an MVU-like method without breaking its convexity. We call this method the Isometric Separation Map and we show that the resulting kernel matrix can be used as a binary/multiclass Support Vector Machine-like method in a semi-supervised (transductive) framework. We also show that the method always finds a kernel matrix that linearly separates the training data exactly without projecting them in infinite dimensional spaces. In traditional SVMs we choose a kernel and hope that the data become linearly separable in the kernel space. In this paper we show how the hyperplane can be chosen ad-hoc and the kernel is trained so that data are always linearly separable. Comparisons with Large Margin SVMs show comparable performance."}
{"text": "  In this report, we derive a non-negative series expansion for the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between two probability distributions. This series expansion is shown to be useful for numerical calculations of the JSD, when the probability distributions are nearly equal, and for which, consequently, small numerical errors dominate evaluation."}
{"text": "  In this paper, I expand Shannon's definition of entropy into a new form of entropy that allows integration of information from different random events. Shannon's notion of entropy is a special case of my more general definition of entropy. I define probability using a so-called performance function, which is de facto an exponential distribution. Assuming that my general notion of entropy reflects the true uncertainty about a probabilistic event, I understand that our perceived uncertainty differs. I claim that our perception is the result of two opposing forces similar to the two famous antagonists in Chinese philosophy: Yin and Yang. Based on this idea, I show that our perceived uncertainty matches the true uncertainty in points determined by the golden ratio. I demonstrate that the well-known sigmoid function, which we typically employ in artificial neural networks as a non-linear threshold function, describes the actual performance. Furthermore, I provide a motivation for the time dilation in Einstein's Special Relativity, basically claiming that although time dilation conforms with our perception, it does not correspond to reality. At the end of the paper, I show how to apply this theoretical framework to practical applications. I present recognition rates for a pattern recognition problem, and also propose a network architecture that can take advantage of general entropy to solve complex decision problems."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of jointly estimating the parameters as well as the structure of binary valued Markov Random Fields, in contrast to earlier work that focus on one of the two problems. We formulate the problem as a maximization of $\\ell_1$-regularized surrogate likelihood that allows us to find a sparse solution. Our optimization technique efficiently incorporates the cutting-plane algorithm in order to obtain a tighter outer bound on the marginal polytope, which results in improvement of both parameter estimates and approximation to marginals. On synthetic data, we compare our algorithm on the two estimation tasks to the other existing methods. We analyze the method in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of dimensions $p$ is allowed to grow with the number of observations $n$. The rate of convergence of the estimate is demonstrated to depend explicitly on the sparsity of the underlying graph."}
{"text": "  Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.   This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.   We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios."}
{"text": "  Ensemble classification is an emerging approach to land cover mapping whereby the final classification output is a result of a consensus of classifiers. Intuitively, an ensemble system should consist of base classifiers which are diverse i.e. classifiers whose decision boundaries err differently. In this paper ensemble feature selection is used to impose diversity in ensembles. The features of the constituent base classifiers for each ensemble were created through an exhaustive search algorithm using different separability indices. For each ensemble, the classification accuracy was derived as well as a diversity measure purported to give a measure of the inensemble diversity. The correlation between ensemble classification accuracy and diversity measure was determined to establish the interplay between the two variables. From the findings of this paper, diversity measures as currently formulated do not provide an adequate means upon which to constitute ensembles for land cover mapping."}
{"text": "  The most direct way to express arbitrary dependencies in datasets is to estimate the joint distribution and to apply afterwards the argmax-function to obtain the mode of the corresponding conditional distribution. This method is in practice difficult, because it requires a global optimization of a complicated function, the joint distribution by fixed input variables. This article proposes a method for finding global maxima if the joint distribution is modeled by a kernel density estimation. Some experiments show advantages and shortcomings of the resulting regression method in comparison to the standard Nadaraya-Watson regression technique, which approximates the optimum by the expectation value."}
{"text": "  We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual information from small-sample data, and apply it to the problem of inferring high-dimensional gene association networks. Specifically, we develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator."}
{"text": "  This paper examines from an experimental perspective random forests, the increasingly used statistical method for classification and regression problems introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001. It first aims at confirming, known but sparse, advice for using random forests and at proposing some complementary remarks for both standard problems as well as high dimensional ones for which the number of variables hugely exceeds the sample size. But the main contribution of this paper is twofold: to provide some insights about the behavior of the variable importance index based on random forests and in addition, to propose to investigate two classical issues of variable selection. The first one is to find important variables for interpretation and the second one is more restrictive and try to design a good prediction model. The strategy involves a ranking of explanatory variables using the random forests score of importance and a stepwise ascending variable introduction strategy."}
{"text": "  Min-cut clustering, based on minimizing one of two heuristic cost-functions proposed by Shi and Malik, has spawned tremendous research, both analytic and algorithmic, in the graph partitioning and image segmentation communities over the last decade. It is however unclear if these heuristics can be derived from a more general principle facilitating generalization to new problem settings. Motivated by an existing graph partitioning framework, we derive relationships between optimizing relevance information, as defined in the Information Bottleneck method, and the regularized cut in a K-partitioned graph. For fast mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the location of random walkers on the graph. For graphs generated from a stochastic algorithm designed to model community structure, the optimal information theoretic partition and the optimal min-cut partition are shown to be the same with high probability."}
{"text": "  The enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last decade. In this paper, we combine the quantum random walk (QRW) with the problem of data clustering, and develop two clustering algorithms based on the one dimensional QRW. Then, the probability distributions on the positions induced by QRW in these algorithms are investigated, which also indicates the possibility of obtaining better results. Consequently, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the clustering algorithms are of fast rates of convergence. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Autoencoder neural network is implemented to estimate the missing data. Genetic algorithm is implemented for network optimization and estimating the missing data. Missing data is treated as Missing At Random mechanism by implementing maximum likelihood algorithm. The network performance is determined by calculating the mean square error of the network prediction. The network is further optimized by implementing Decision Forest. The impact of missing data is then investigated and decision forrests are found to improve the results."}
{"text": "  We present a convex formulation of dictionary learning for sparse signal decomposition. Convexity is obtained by replacing the usual explicit upper bound on the dictionary size by a convex rank-reducing term similar to the trace norm. In particular, our formulation introduces an explicit trade-off between size and sparsity of the decomposition of rectangular matrices. Using a large set of synthetic examples, we compare the estimation abilities of the convex and non-convex approaches, showing that while the convex formulation has a single local minimum, this may lead in some cases to performance which is inferior to the local minima of the non-convex formulation."}
{"text": "  We obtain an index of the complexity of a random sequence by allowing the role of the measure in classical probability theory to be played by a function we call the generating mechanism. Typically, this generating mechanism will be a finite automata. We generate a set of biased sequences by applying a finite state automata with a specified number, $m$, of states to the set of all binary sequences. Thus we can index the complexity of our random sequence by the number of states of the automata. We detail optimal algorithms to predict sequences generated in this way."}
{"text": "  We introduce a simple and computationally trivial method for binary classification based on the evaluation of potential functions. We demonstrate that despite the conceptual and computational simplicity of the method its performance can match or exceed that of standard Support Vector Machine methods."}
{"text": "  We consider bandit problems involving a large (possibly infinite) collection of arms, in which the expected reward of each arm is a linear function of an $r$-dimensional random vector $\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^r$, where $r \\geq 2$. The objective is to minimize the cumulative regret and Bayes risk. When the set of arms corresponds to the unit sphere, we prove that the regret and Bayes risk is of order $\\Theta(r \\sqrt{T})$, by establishing a lower bound for an arbitrary policy, and showing that a matching upper bound is obtained through a policy that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases. The phase-based policy is also shown to be effective if the set of arms satisfies a strong convexity condition. For the case of a general set of arms, we describe a near-optimal policy whose regret and Bayes risk admit upper bounds of the form $O(r \\sqrt{T} \\log^{3/2} T)$."}
{"text": "  We present a practical and statistically consistent scheme for actively learning binary classifiers under general loss functions. Our algorithm uses importance weighting to correct sampling bias, and by controlling the variance, we are able to give rigorous label complexity bounds for the learning process. Experiments on passively labeled data show that this approach reduces the label complexity required to achieve good predictive performance on many learning problems."}
{"text": "  There has been an explosion of interest in statistical models for analyzing network data, and considerable interest in the class of exponential random graph (ERG) models, especially in connection with difficulties in computing maximum likelihood estimates. The issues associated with these difficulties relate to the broader structure of discrete exponential families. This paper re-examines the issues in two parts. First we consider the closure of $k$-dimensional exponential families of distribution with discrete base measure and polyhedral convex support $\\mathrm{P}$. We show that the normal fan of $\\mathrm{P}$ is a geometric object that plays a fundamental role in deriving the statistical and geometric properties of the corresponding extended exponential families. We discuss its relevance to maximum likelihood estimation, both from a theoretical and computational standpoint. Second, we apply our results to the analysis of ERG models. In particular, by means of a detailed example, we provide some characterization of the properties of ERG models, and, in particular, of certain behaviors of ERG models known as degeneracy."}
{"text": "  Cooperative decision making is a vision of future network management and control. Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic flows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network. Hence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how accurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes. Connection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is optimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop, based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed algorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal preemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the distributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and simulation."}
{"text": "  In statistical problems, a set of parameterized probability distributions is used to estimate the true probability distribution. If Fisher information matrix at the true distribution is singular, then it has been left unknown what we can estimate about the true distribution from random samples. In this paper, we study a singular regression problem and prove a limit theorem which shows the relation between the singular regression problem and two birational invariants, a real log canonical threshold and a singular fluctuation. The obtained theorem has an important application to statistics, because it enables us to estimate the generalization error from the training error without any knowledge of the true probability distribution."}
{"text": "  Scenarios for the emergence or bootstrap of a lexicon involve the repeated interaction between at least two agents who must reach a consensus on how to name N objects using H words. Here we consider minimal models of two types of learning algorithms: cross-situational learning, in which the individuals determine the meaning of a word by looking for something in common across all observed uses of that word, and supervised operant conditioning learning, in which there is strong feedback between individuals about the intended meaning of the words. Despite the stark differences between these learning schemes, we show that they yield the same communication accuracy in the realistic limits of large N and H, which coincides with the result of the classical occupancy problem of randomly assigning N objects to H words."}
{"text": "  This article introduces both a new algorithm for reconstructing epsilon-machines from data, as well as the decisional states. These are defined as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are thus the \"emerging\" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a change of decision. The new REMAPF algorithm estimates both the epsilon-machine and the decisional states from data. Application examples are given for hidden model reconstruction, cellular automata filtering, and edge detection in images."}

{"text": "  Recently, different works proposed a new way to mine patterns in databases with pathological size. For example, experiments in genome biology usually provide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects (experiments). In this case, mining the \"transposed\" database runs through a smaller search space, and the Galois connection allows to infer the closed patterns of the original database. We focus here on constrained pattern mining for those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and constraint transposition. We discuss the properties of constraint transposition and look into classical constraints. We then address the problem of generating the closed patterns of the original database satisfying the constraint, starting from those mined in the \"transposed\" database. Finally, we show how to generate all the patterns satisfying the constraint from the closed ones."}
{"text": "  We consider multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under the assumption of output sparsity -- that the target (label) vectors have small support. We develop a general theory for a variant of the popular error correcting output code scheme, using ideas from compressed sensing for exploiting this sparsity. The method can be regarded as a simple reduction from multi-label regression problems to binary regression problems. We show that the number of subproblems need only be logarithmic in the total number of possible labels, making this approach radically more efficient than others. We also state and prove robustness guarantees for this method in the form of regret transform bounds (in general), and also provide a more detailed analysis for the linear prediction setting."}
{"text": "  The runtime for Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to compute the fit is quadratic in the number of examples. However, the necessity of obtaining sensitivity measures as degrees of freedom for model selection or confidence intervals for more detailed analysis requires cubic runtime, and thus constitutes a computational bottleneck in real-world data analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for KPLS which not only computes (a) the fit, but also (b) its approximate degrees of freedom and (c) error bars in quadratic runtime. The algorithm exploits a close connection between Kernel PLS and the Lanczos algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, and uses this approximation to compute the trace of powers of the kernel matrix in quadratic runtime."}
{"text": "  This paper formalises the concept of learning symbolic rules from multisource data in a cardiac monitoring context. Our sources, electrocardiograms and arterial blood pressure measures, describe cardiac behaviours from different viewpoints. To learn interpretable rules, we use an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) method. We develop an original strategy to cope with the dimensionality issues caused by using this ILP technique on a rich multisource language. The results show that our method greatly improves the feasibility and the efficiency of the process while staying accurate. They also confirm the benefits of using multiple sources to improve the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias."}

{"text": "  The problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries is often encountered in the analysis of incomplete data sets exhibiting an underlying factor model with applications in collaborative filtering, computer vision and control. Most recent work had been focused on constructing efficient algorithms for exact or approximate recovery of the missing matrix entries and proving lower bounds for the number of known entries that guarantee a successful recovery with high probability. A related problem from both the mathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of realizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise distances. Rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of the realization satisfying a given partial set of distances. We observe that basic ideas and tools of rigidity theory can be adapted to determine uniqueness of low-rank matrix completion, where inner products play the role that distances play in rigidity theory. This observation leads to an efficient randomized algorithm for testing both local and global unique completion. Crucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the completion matrix, that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new protocol for prediction with expert advice in which each expert evaluates the learner's and his own performance using a loss function that may change over time and may be different from the loss functions used by the other experts. The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously. If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the standard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the case of \"specialist\" (or \"sleeping\") experts. In this case, the defensive forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating Algorithm."}
{"text": "  We present multiplicative updates for solving hard and soft margin support vector machines (SVM) with non-negative kernels. They follow as a natural extension of the updates for non-negative matrix factorization. No additional param- eter setting, such as choosing learning, rate is required.

We test the performance on several datasets using various non-negative kernels and report equivalent generalization errors to that of a standard SVM."}
{"text": "  Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula--or \"nonparanormal\"--for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples."}
{"text": "  Collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose scaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers. When the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels given by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme case, may reach total inconsistency. In this paper we describe how globally consistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination, and discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor. We define a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of globally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by distributed teachers. We show that the efficiency depends critically on the ratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and the number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of classes drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0)."}

Finally, it reports the results of experiments with local transductive regression demonstrating the benefit of our stability bounds for model selection, for one of the algorithms, in particular for determining the radius of the local neighborhood used by the algorithm."}
{"text": "  Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate causal models in classical situations with fewer variables than observations (p<n, p: the number of variables and n: the number of observations). However, modern datasets including gene expression data need high-dimensional causal modeling in challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than observations (p>>n). In this paper, we propose a method to find exogenous variables in a linear non-Gaussian causal model, which requires much smaller sample sizes than conventional methods and works even when p>>n. The key idea is to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead of estimating the entire structure of the model. Exogenous variables work as triggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the causal mechanism. We present experiments with artificial data and real-world gene expression data to evaluate the method."}
{"text": "  Motivation: Several different threads of research have been proposed for modeling and mining temporal data. On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model relationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are intractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as frequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the rigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical models literature.   Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of research, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be inferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the modeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter. First, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on influences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using a greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN structure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct occurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, we focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called excitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can be conducted using just information from frequent episodes. Application on datasets gathered from mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real neuroscience datasets are presented.   Availability: Algorithmic implementations, simulator codebases, and datasets are available from our website at http://neural-code.cs.vt.edu/dbn"}
{"text": "  We consider the empirical risk minimization problem for linear supervised learning, with regularization by structured sparsity-inducing norms. These are defined as sums of Euclidean norms on certain subsets of variables, extending the usual $\\ell_1$-norm and the group $\\ell_1$-norm by allowing the subsets to overlap. This leads to a specific set of allowed nonzero patterns for the solutions of such problems. We first explore the relationship between the groups defining the norm and the resulting nonzero patterns, providing both forward and backward algorithms to go back and forth from groups to patterns. This allows the design of norms adapted to specific prior knowledge expressed in terms of nonzero patterns. We also present an efficient active set algorithm, and analyze the consistency of variable selection for least-squares linear regression in low and high-dimensional settings."}

{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the coherent theory of (epistemic) uncertainty of Walley, in which beliefs are represented through sets of probability distributions, and we focus on the problem of modeling prior ignorance about a categorical random variable. In this setting, it is a known result that a state of prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem, another state of beliefs, called \\emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed. Near-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles that can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows learning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the problem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs. The key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of interest that is \\emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent variables (and general \\emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if satisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This condition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical problems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the possibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical problems."}
{"text": "  Engine assembly is a complex and heavily automated distributed-control process, with large amounts of faults data logged everyday. We describe an application of temporal data mining for analyzing fault logs in an engine assembly plant. Frequent episode discovery framework is a model-free method that can be used to deduce (temporal) correlations among events from the logs in an efficient manner. In addition to being theoretically elegant and computationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the form actionable recommendations. Incorporation of domain-specific information is critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in the manufacturing domain. We show how domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated using heuristic rules that act as pre-filters and post-filters to frequent episode discovery. The system described here is currently being used in one of the engine assembly plants of General Motors and is planned for adaptation in other plants. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first real, large-scale application of temporal data mining in the manufacturing domain. We believe that the ideas presented in this paper can help practitioners engineer tools for analysis in other similar or related application domains as well."}

{"text": "  We present three related ways of using Transfer Learning to improve feature selection. The three methods address different problems, and hence share different kinds of information between tasks or feature classes, but all three are based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and share the same underlying Bayesian interpretation. The first method, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for multiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features. MIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models and is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our second method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case when the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method, Transfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task to which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have different amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial when we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of labeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different verbs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches with experimental results on real world data pertaining to genomics and to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)."}
{"text": "  Many learning machines that have hierarchical structure or hidden variables are now being used in information science, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics. However, several learning machines used in such fields are not regular but singular statistical models, hence their generalization performance is still left unknown. To overcome these problems, in the previous papers, we proved new equations in statistical learning, by which we can estimate the Bayes generalization loss from the Bayes training loss and the functional variance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity contained in a learning machine. In this paper, we prove that the same equations hold even if a true distribution is not contained in a parametric model. Also we prove that, the proposed equations in a regular case are asymptotically equivalent to the Takeuchi information criterion. Therefore, the proposed equations are always applicable without any condition on the unknown true distribution."}

We give the weights that separate these sets, which may be used to compare results found by other algorithms."}
{"text": "  Clusters of genes that have evolved by repeated segmental duplication present difficult challenges throughout genomic analysis, from sequence assembly to functional analysis. Improved understanding of these clusters is of utmost importance, since they have been shown to be the source of evolutionary innovation, and have been linked to multiple diseases, including HIV and a variety of cancers. Previously, Zhang et al. (2008) developed an algorithm for reconstructing parsimonious evolutionary histories of such gene clusters, using only human genomic sequence data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for the evolution of gene clusters on a phylogeny, and an MCMC algorithm for reconstruction of duplication histories from genomic sequences in multiple species. Several projects are underway to obtain high quality BAC-based assemblies of duplicated clusters in multiple species, and we anticipate that our method will be useful in analyzing these valuable new data sets."}
{"text": "  Variable selection for high-dimensional linear models has received a lot of attention lately, mostly in the context of l1-regularization. Part of the attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained, which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power, however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand, lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize. A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily to visualization and interpretation. The predictive power is maintained at least at the same level as the original tree ensemble. A key feature of the method is that, once a tree ensemble is fitted, no further tuning parameter needs to be selected. The empirical performance is demonstrated on a wide array of datasets."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present two classes of Bayesian approaches to the two-sample problem.

{"text": "  Most accurate predictions are typically obtained by learning machines with complex feature spaces (as e.g. induced by kernels). Unfortunately, such decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in simulations."}
{"text": "  Selecting important features in non-linear or kernel spaces is a difficult challenge in both classification and regression problems. When many of the features are irrelevant, kernel methods such as the support vector machine and kernel ridge regression can sometimes perform poorly. We propose weighting the features within a kernel with a sparse set of weights that are estimated in conjunction with the original classification or regression problem. The iterative algorithm, KNIFE, alternates between finding the coefficients of the original problem and finding the feature weights through kernel linearization. In addition, a slight modification of KNIFE yields an efficient algorithm for finding feature regularization paths, or the paths of each feature's weight. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of KNIFE for both kernel regression and support vector machines with a variety of kernels. Feature path realizations also reveal important non-linear correlations among features that prove useful in determining a subset of significant variables. Results on vowel recognition data, Parkinson's disease data, and microarray data are also given."}

We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these \"reference types\") that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over infinitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple--but general--parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms.

{"text": "  Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian framework for density estimation. Unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost: inference in DP mixture models is computationally expensive, even when conjugate distributions are used. In the common case when one seeks only a maximum a posteriori assignment of data points to clusters, we show that search algorithms provide a practical alternative to expensive MCMC and variational techniques. When a true posterior sample is desired, the solution found by search can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental results show that using these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very large data sets."}

The bounds lead us to consider sample variance penalization, a novel learning method which takes into account the empirical variance of the loss function. We give conditions under which sample variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are situations in which the excess risk of our method is of order 1/n, while the excess risk of empirical risk minimization is of order 1/sqrt/{n}. We show some experimental results, which confirm the theory. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our results to sample compression schemes."}
{"text": "  We discuss here the mean-field theory for a cellular automata model of meta-learning. The meta-learning is the process of combining outcomes of individual learning procedures in order to determine the final decision with higher accuracy than any single learning method. Our method is constructed from an ensemble of interacting, learning agents, that acquire and process incoming information using various types, or different versions of machine learning algorithms. The abstract learning space, where all agents are located, is constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents with random strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher level integration of information acquired from the independent learning trials. The final classification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the stationary state of the meta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet the minority clusters that share opposite classification outcome can be observed in the system. Therefore, the probability of selecting proper class for a given input data, can be estimated even without the prior knowledge of its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easily introduced into the system, even if learning agents are build from simple binary classification machine learning algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeing agents."}

We are interested in the actual clustering, not only in the costs of the solution. We analyze when different initializations lead to the same local optimum, and when they lead to different local optima. This enables us to prove that it is reasonable to select the number of clusters based on stability scores."}

Appropriate variables are identified to create useful clusters using relevant information. The CSRN was next modified to allow for an additional external input. With this additional input, several methods were tested and results show that clustering the mazes improves the overall learning of the traversal problem for the CSRN."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new nearest-prototype classifier, the prototype vector machine (PVM). It arises from a combinatorial optimization problem which we cast as a variant of the set cover problem. We propose two algorithms for approximating its solution. The PVM selects a relatively small number of representative points which can then be used for classification. It contains 1-NN as a special case. The method is compatible with any dissimilarity measure, making it amenable to situations in which the data are not embedded in an underlying feature space or in which using a non-Euclidean metric is desirable. Indeed, we demonstrate on the much studied ZIP code data how the PVM can reap the benefits of a problem-specific metric. In this example, the PVM outperforms the highly successful 1-NN with tangent distance, and does so retaining fewer than half of the data points. This example highlights the strengths of the PVM in yielding a low-error, highly interpretable model. Additionally, we apply the PVM to a protein classification problem in which a kernel-based distance is used."}

{"text": "  We present in this work a new family of kernels to compare positive measures on arbitrary spaces $\\Xcal$ endowed with a positive kernel $\\kappa$, which translates naturally into kernels between histograms or clouds of points. We first cover the case where $\\Xcal$ is Euclidian, and focus on kernels which take into account the variance matrix of the mixture of two measures to compute their similarity. The kernels we define are semigroup kernels in the sense that they only use the sum of two measures to compare them, and spectral in the sense that they only use the eigenspectrum of the variance matrix of this mixture. We show that such a family of kernels has close bonds with the laplace transforms of nonnegative-valued functions defined on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, and we present some closed formulas that can be derived as special cases of such integral expressions. By focusing further on functions which are invariant to the addition of a null eigenvalue to the spectrum of the variance matrix, we can define kernels between atomic measures on arbitrary spaces $\\Xcal$ endowed with a kernel $\\kappa$ by using directly the eigenvalues of the centered Gram matrix of the joined support of the compared measures. We provide explicit formulas suited for applications and present preliminary experiments to illustrate the interest of the approach."}

The algorithm has probabilistic guarantees and is capable of training SVMs with Kernels for both classification and regression problems. Experiments done on synthetic and real life data sets demonstrate that the algorithm scales up existing SVM learners, without loss of accuracy."}

It is applicable to Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes an original approach to cluster multi-component data sets, including an estimation of the number of clusters. From the construction of a minimal spanning tree with Prim's algorithm, and the assumption that the vertices are approximately distributed according to a Poisson distribution, the number of clusters is estimated by thresholding the Prim's trajectory. The corresponding cluster centroids are then computed in order to initialize the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, also known as $K$-means, which allows to circumvent initialization problems. Some results are derived for evaluating the false positive rate of our cluster detection algorithm, with the help of approximations relevant in Euclidean spaces. Metrics used for measuring similarity between multi-dimensional data points are based on symmetrical divergences. The use of these informational divergences together with the proposed method leads to better results, compared to other clustering methods for the problem of astrophysical data processing. Some applications of this method in the multi/hyper-spectral imagery domain to a satellite view of Paris and to an image of the Mars planet are also presented. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of divergences in our problem, the method with informational divergence as similarity measure is compared with the same method using classical metrics. In the astrophysics application, we also compare the method with the spectral clustering algorithms."}

We prove conditions for the asymptotic unbiasedness of the DP-GLM regression mean function estimate. We also give examples for when those conditions hold, including models for compactly supported continuous distributions and a model with continuous covariates and categorical response. We empirically analyze the properties of the DP-GLM and why it provides better results than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We evaluate DP-GLM on several data sets, comparing it to modern methods of nonparametric regression like CART, Bayesian trees and Gaussian processes.

{"text": "  In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi--supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step. Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach."}

It is shown how this can be used to build a heuristic approximation to the maximum relationship over a finite set of Gaussian variables, allowing approximate inference by Expectation Propagation on such quantities."}

On the other hand, a novel technique is suggested to prune and to filter discovered rules. The proposed framework was applied successfully over the client database provided by Nantes Habitat."}
{"text": "  Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation of functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately, exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large dataset into a small set of basis points. The most advanced of these, the variable-sigma GP (VSGP) (Walder et al., 2008), allows each basis point to have its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. We describe how VSGP can be applied to classification and other problems, by deriving it as an expectation propagation algorithm. In this view, sparse GP approximations correspond to a KL-projection of the true posterior onto a compact exponential family of GPs. VSGP constitutes one such family, and we show how to enlarge this family to get additional accuracy. In particular, we show that endowing each basis point with its own full covariance matrix provides a significant increase in approximation power."}
{"text": "  This paper reviews the functional aspects of statistical learning theory. The main point under consideration is the nature of the hypothesis set when no prior information is available but data. Within this framework we first discuss about the hypothesis set: it is a vectorial space, it is a set of pointwise defined functions, and the evaluation functional on this set is a continuous mapping. Based on these principles an original theory is developed generalizing the notion of reproduction kernel Hilbert space to non hilbertian sets. Then it is shown that the hypothesis set of any learning machine has to be a generalized reproducing set. Therefore, thanks to a general \"representer theorem\", the solution of the learning problem is still a linear combination of a kernel. Furthermore, a way to design these kernels is given. To illustrate this framework some examples of such reproducing sets and kernels are given."}

{"text": "  The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle states that the optimal model for a given data set is that which compresses it best. Due to practial limitations the model can be restricted to a class such as linear regression models, which we address in this study. As in other formulations such as the LASSO and forward step-wise regression we are interested in sparsifying the feature set while preserving generalization ability. We derive a well-principled set of codes for both parameters and error residuals along with smooth approximations to lengths of these codes as to allow gradient descent optimization of description length, and go on to show that sparsification and feature selection using our approach is faster than the LASSO on several datasets from the UCI and StatLib repositories, with favorable generalization accuracy, while being fully automatic, requiring neither cross-validation nor tuning of regularization hyper-parameters, allowing even for a nonlinear expansion of the feature set followed by sparsification."}

{"text": "  We propose a novel non-parametric adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional data based on score functions derived from nearest neighbor graphs on $n$-point nominal data. Anomalies are declared whenever the score of a test sample falls below $\\alpha$, which is supposed to be the desired false alarm level. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal in that it is uniformly most powerful for the specified false alarm level, $\\alpha$, for the case when the anomaly density is a mixture of the nominal and a known density. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, being linear in dimension and quadratic in data size. It does not require choosing complicated tuning parameters or function approximation classes and it can adapt to local structure such as local change in dimensionality. We demonstrate the algorithm on both artificial and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces."}
{"text": "  We propose a method to infer causal structures containing both discrete and continuous variables. The idea is to select causal hypotheses for which the conditional density of every variable, given its causes, becomes smooth. We define a family of smooth densities and conditional densities by second order exponential models, i.e., by maximizing conditional entropy subject to first and second statistical moments. If some of the variables take only values in proper subsets of R^n, these conditionals can induce different families of joint distributions even for Markov-equivalent graphs.   We consider the case of one binary and one real-valued variable where the method can distinguish between cause and effect. Using this example, we describe that sometimes a causal hypothesis must be rejected because P(effect|cause) and P(cause) share algorithmic information (which is untypical if they are chosen independently). This way, our method is in the same spirit as faithfulness-based causal inference because it also rejects non-generic mutual adjustments among DAG-parameters."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we prove a crucial theorem called Mirroring Theorem which affirms that given a collection of samples with enough information in it such that it can be classified into classes and subclasses then (i) There exists a mapping which classifies and subclassifies these samples (ii) There exists a hierarchical classifier which can be constructed by using Mirroring Neural Networks (MNNs) in combination with a clustering algorithm that can approximate this mapping. Thus, the proof of the Mirroring theorem provides a theoretical basis for the existence and a practical feasibility of constructing hierarchical classifiers, given the maps. Our proposed Mirroring Theorem can also be considered as an extension to Kolmogrovs theorem in providing a realistic solution for unsupervised classification. The techniques we develop, are general in nature and have led to the construction of learning machines which are (i) tree like in structure, (ii) modular (iii) with each module running on a common algorithm (tandem algorithm) and (iv) selfsupervised. We have actually built the architecture, developed the tandem algorithm of such a hierarchical classifier and demonstrated it on an example problem."}
{"text": "  Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables from a finite sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently, methods using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of continuous variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest are discrete or even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the notion of additive noise models to these cases. We prove that whenever the joint distribution $\\prob^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g. $Y=f(X)+N, N \\independent X$, it does not admit the reversed model $X=g(Y)+\\tilde N, \\tilde N \\independent Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a generic way. Based on these deliberations we propose an efficient new algorithm that is able to distinguish between cause and effect for a finite sample of discrete variables. In an extensive experimental study we show that this algorithm works both on synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "  This paper describes a methodology for detecting anomalies from sequentially observed and potentially noisy data. The proposed approach consists of two main elements: (1) {\\em filtering}, or assigning a belief or likelihood to each successive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy observations, and (2) {\\em hedging}, or flagging potential anomalies by comparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive threshold. The threshold is adjusted based on the available feedback from an end user. Our algorithms, which combine universal prediction with recent work on online convex programming, do not require computing posterior distributions given all current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter updates. At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same exponential family. Moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides with the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game. We also prove bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all estimated beliefs and feedback signals. We validate the theory on synthetic data drawn from a time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high dimensionality, as well as on the Enron email dataset."}
{"text": "  We present in this paper a study on the ability and the benefits of using a keystroke dynamics authentication method for collaborative systems. Authentication is a challenging issue in order to guarantee the security of use of collaborative systems during the access control step. Many solutions exist in the state of the art such as the use of one time passwords or smart-cards. We focus in this paper on biometric based solutions that do not necessitate any additional sensor. Keystroke dynamics is an interesting solution as it uses only the keyboard and is invisible for users. Many methods have been published in this field. We make a comparative study of many of them considering the operational constraints of use for collaborative systems."}
{"text": "  Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying driving forces from quickly varying nonstationary time series. We show here that it is possible for SFA to detect a component which is even slower than the driving force itself (e.g. the envelope of a modulated sine wave). It is shown that it depends on circumstances like the embedding dimension, the time series predictability, or the base frequency, whether the driving force itself or a slower subcomponent is detected. We observe a phase transition from one regime to the other and it is the purpose of this work to quantify the influence of various parameters on this phase transition. We conclude that what is percieved as slow by SFA varies and that a more or less fast switching from one regime to the other occurs, perhaps showing some similarity to human perception."}

{"text": "  Recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different sparse approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies present naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a single output. We show experimental results with synthetic and real data, in particular, we show results in pollution prediction, school exams score prediction and gene expression data."}
{"text": "  This survey is an introduction to positive definite kernels and the set of methods they have inspired in the machine learning literature, namely kernel methods. We first discuss some properties of positive definite kernels as well as reproducing kernel Hibert spaces, the natural extension of the set of functions $\\{k(x,\\cdot),x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\}$ associated with a kernel $k$ defined on a space $\\mathcal{X}$. We discuss at length the construction of kernel functions that take advantage of well-known statistical models. We provide an overview of numerous data-analysis methods which take advantage of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the idea of combining several kernels to improve the performance on certain tasks. We also provide a short cookbook of different kernels which are particularly useful for certain data-types such as images, graphs or speech segments."}
{"text": "  One of the most popular algorithms for clustering in Euclidean space is the $k$-means algorithm; $k$-means is difficult to analyze mathematically, and few theoretical guarantees are known about it, particularly when the data is {\\em well-clustered}. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular, we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian -- or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.   We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption. First, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical Gaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the subspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an exact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm, when the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical Gaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation between the mixture components.   Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2 spherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required by a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing separation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures of two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the sample requirement of $k$-means is {\\em near-optimal}."}
{"text": "  This article addresses the modeling of reverberant recording environments in the context of under-determined convolutive blind source separation. We model the contribution of each source to all mixture channels in the time-frequency domain as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable whose covariance encodes the spatial characteristics of the source. We then consider four specific covariance models, including a full-rank unconstrained model. We derive a family of iterative expectationmaximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the parameters of each model and propose suitable procedures to initialize the parameters and to align the order of the estimated sources across all frequency bins based on their estimated directions of arrival (DOA). Experimental results over reverberant synthetic mixtures and live recordings of speech data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider delay-optimal power and subcarrier allocation design for OFDMA systems with $N_F$ subcarriers, $K$ mobiles and one base station. There are $K$ queues at the base station for the downlink traffic to the $K$ mobiles with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We shall model the problem as a $K$-dimensional infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Problem (MDP) where the control actions are assumed to be a function of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) as well as the joint Queue State Information (QSI). This problem is challenging because it corresponds to a stochastic Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem where general solution is still unknown. We propose an {\\em online stochastic value iteration} solution using {\\em stochastic approximation}. The proposed power control algorithm, which is a function of both the CSI and the QSI, takes the form of multi-level water-filling. We prove that under two mild conditions in Theorem 1 (One is the stepsize condition. The other is the condition on accessibility of the Markov Chain, which can be easily satisfied in most of the cases we are interested.), the proposed solution converges to the optimal solution almost surely (with probability 1) and the proposed framework offers a possible solution to the general stochastic NUM problem. By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics, we obtain a reduced complexity decomposed solution with linear $\\mathcal{O}(KN_F)$ complexity and $\\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory requirement."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of \"hyper-sparse aggregation\". Namely, given a dictionary $F = \\{f_1, ..., f_M \\}$ of functions, we look for an optimal aggregation algorithm that writes $\\tilde f = \\sum_{j=1}^M \\theta_j f_j$ with as many zero coefficients $\\theta_j$ as possible. This problem is of particular interest when $F$ contains many irrelevant functions that should not appear in $\\tilde{f}$. We provide an exact oracle inequality for $\\tilde f$, where only two coefficients are non-zero, that entails $\\tilde f$ to be an optimal aggregation algorithm. Since selectors are suboptimal aggregation procedures, this proves that 2 is the minimal number of elements of $F$ required for the construction of an optimal aggregation procedures in every situations. A simulated example of this algorithm is proposed on a dictionary obtained using LARS, for the problem of selection of the regularization parameter of the LASSO. We also give an example of use of aggregation to achieve minimax adaptation over anisotropic Besov spaces, which was not previously known in minimax theory (in regression on a random design)."}
{"text": "  Association rule mining plays vital part in knowledge mining. The difficult task is discovering knowledge or useful rules from the large number of rules generated for reduced support. For pruning or grouping rules, several techniques are used such as rule structure cover methods, informative cover methods, rule clustering, etc. Another way of selecting association rules is based on interestingness measures such as support, confidence, correlation, and so on. In this paper, we study how rule clusters of the pattern Xi - Y are distributed over different interestingness measures."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a tumor detection algorithm from mammogram. The proposed system focuses on the solution of two problems. One is how to detect tumors as suspicious regions with a very weak contrast to their background and another is how to extract features which categorize tumors. The tumor detection method follows the scheme of (a) mammogram enhancement. (b) The segmentation of the tumor area. (c) The extraction of features from the segmented tumor area. (d) The use of SVM classifier. The enhancement can be defined as conversion of the image quality to a better and more understandable level. The mammogram enhancement procedure includes filtering, top hat operation, DWT. Then the contrast stretching is used to increase the contrast of the image. The segmentation of mammogram images has been playing an important role to improve the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. The most common segmentation method used is thresholding. The features are extracted from the segmented breast area. Next stage include, which classifies the regions using the SVM classifier. The method was tested on 75 mammographic images, from the mini-MIAS database. The methodology achieved a sensitivity of 88.75%."}
{"text": "  We extend multi-way, multivariate ANOVA-type analysis to cases where one covariate is the view, with features of each view coming from different, high-dimensional domains. The different views are assumed to be connected by having paired samples; this is a common setup in recent bioinformatics experiments, of which we analyze metabolite profiles in different conditions (disease vs. control and treatment vs. untreated) in different tissues (views). We introduce a multi-way latent variable model for this new task, by extending the generative model of Bayesian canonical correlation analysis (CCA) both to take multi-way covariate information into account as population priors, and by reducing the dimensionality by an integrated factor analysis that assumes the metabolites to come in correlated groups."}
{"text": "  Interest in multioutput kernel methods is increasing, whether under the guise of multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function over correlated output functions. One way of constructing such kernels is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence (2009) recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series."}
{"text": "  We study losses for binary classification and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and ``classification calibrated'' losses. We also consider the question of the ``best'' surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of ``best'' and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of ``surrogate tuning''. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassification noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassification noise."}
{"text": "  We provide yet another proof of the existence of calibrated forecasters; it has two merits. First, it is valid for an arbitrary finite number of outcomes. Second, it is short and simple and it follows from a direct application of Blackwell's approachability theorem to carefully chosen vector-valued payoff function and convex target set. Our proof captures the essence of existing proofs based on approachability (e.g., the proof by Foster, 1999 in case of binary outcomes) and highlights the intrinsic connection between approachability and calibration."}
{"text": "  Among all the partition based clustering algorithms K-means is the most popular and well known method. It generally shows impressive results even in considerably large data sets. The computational complexity of K-means does not suffer from the size of the data set. The main disadvantage faced in performing this clustering is that the selection of initial means. If the user does not have adequate knowledge about the data set, it may lead to erroneous results. The algorithm Automatic Initialization of Means (AIM), which is an extension to K-means, has been proposed to overcome the problem of initial mean generation. In this paper an attempt has been made to compare the performance of the algorithms through implementation"}
{"text": "  Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches."}
{"text": "  Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets."}
{"text": "  In this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing a hidden weighted hypergraph of constant rank using additive queries. We prove the following: Let $G$ be a weighted hidden hypergraph of constant rank with n vertices and $m$ hyperedges. For any $m$ there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\\frac{m\\log n}{\\log m}) $$ additive queries. This solves the open problem in [S. Choi, J. H. Kim. Optimal Query Complexity Bounds for Finding Graphs. {\\em STOC}, 749--758,~2008].   When the weights of the hypergraph are integers that are less than $O(poly(n^d/m))$ where $d$ is the rank of the hypergraph (and therefore for unweighted hypergraphs) there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\\frac{m\\log \\frac{n^d}{m}}{\\log m}). $$ additive queries.   Using the information theoretic bound the above query complexities are tight."}

We kernelize one of the algorithms and prove theoretical guarantees on its loss. We perform experiments and compare our algorithms with logistic regression."}
{"text": "  Discovering latent representations of the observed world has become increasingly more relevant in data analysis. Much of the effort concentrates on building latent variables which can be used in prediction problems, such as classification and regression. A related goal of learning latent structure from data is that of identifying which hidden common causes generate the observations, such as in applications that require predicting the effect of policies. This will be the main problem tackled in our contribution: given a dataset of indicators assumed to be generated by unknown and unmeasured common causes, we wish to discover which hidden common causes are those, and how they generate our data. This is possible under the assumption that observed variables are linear functions of the latent causes with additive noise. Previous results in the literature present solutions for the case where each observed variable is a noisy function of a single latent variable. We show how to extend the existing results for some cases where observed variables measure more than one latent variable."}
{"text": "  We study graph estimation and density estimation in high dimensions, using a family of density estimators based on forest structured undirected graphical models. For density estimation, we do not assume the true distribution corresponds to a forest; rather, we form kernel density estimates of the bivariate and univariate marginals, and apply Kruskal's algorithm to estimate the optimal forest on held out data. We prove an oracle inequality on the excess risk of the resulting estimator relative to the risk of the best forest. For graph estimation, we consider the problem of estimating forests with restricted tree sizes. We prove that finding a maximum weight spanning forest with restricted tree size is NP-hard, and develop an approximation algorithm for this problem. Viewing the tree size as a complexity parameter, we then select a forest using data splitting, and prove bounds on excess risk and structure selection consistency of the procedure. Experiments with simulated data and microarray data indicate that the methods are a practical alternative to Gaussian graphical models."}
{"text": "  Bayes statistics and statistical physics have the common mathematical structure, where the log likelihood function corresponds to the random Hamiltonian. Recently, it was discovered that the asymptotic learning curves in Bayes estimation are subject to a universal law, even if the log likelihood function can not be approximated by any quadratic form. However, it is left unknown what mathematical property ensures such a universal law. In this paper, we define a renormalizable condition of the statistical estimation problem, and show that, under such a condition, the asymptotic learning curves are ensured to be subject to the universal law, even if the true distribution is unrealizable and singular for a statistical model. Also we study a nonrenormalizable case, in which the learning curves have the different asymptotic behaviors from the universal law."}

The difficult task in building Associative Classifier model is the selection of relevant rules from a large number of class association rules (CARs). A very popular method of ordering rules for selection is based on confidence, support and antecedent size (CSA). Other methods are based on hybrid orderings in which CSA method is combined with other measures.

{"text": "  This paper presents a framework aimed at monitoring the behavior of aircraft in a given airspace. Nominal trajectories are determined and learned using data driven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC) to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the runway occupancy. Even though standard procedures are used by ATC, the control of the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the flight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their variability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is then used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations previously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is presented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in real time. The airspace is \"healthy\" when all aircraft are flying according to the nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the conformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does not conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to ensure a safe separation between aircraft."}
{"text": "  The paper deals with on-line regression settings with signals belonging to a Banach lattice. Our algorithms work in a semi-online setting where all the inputs are known in advance and outcomes are unknown and given step by step. We apply the Aggregating Algorithm to construct a prediction method whose cumulative loss over all the input vectors is comparable with the cumulative loss of any linear functional on the Banach lattice. As a by-product we get an algorithm that takes signals from an arbitrary domain. Its cumulative loss is comparable with the cumulative loss of any predictor function from Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. We describe several applications of our setting."}
{"text": "  The performance in higher secondary school education in India is a turning point in the academic lives of all students. As this academic performance is influenced by many factors, it is essential to develop predictive data mining model for students' performance so as to identify the slow learners and study the influence of the dominant factors on their academic performance. In the present investigation, a survey cum experimental methodology was adopted to generate a database and it was constructed from a primary and a secondary source. While the primary data was collected from the regular students, the secondary data was gathered from the school and office of the Chief Educational Officer (CEO). A total of 1000 datasets of the year 2006 from five different schools in three different districts of Tamilnadu were collected. The raw data was preprocessed in terms of filling up missing values, transforming values in one form into another and relevant attribute/ variable selection. As a result, we had 772 student records, which were used for CHAID prediction model construction. A set of prediction rules were extracted from CHIAD prediction model and the efficiency of the generated CHIAD prediction model was found. The accuracy of the present model was compared with other model and it has been found to be satisfactory."}
{"text": "  The recent increase in dimensionality of data has thrown a great challenge to the existing dimensionality reduction methods in terms of their effectiveness. Dimensionality reduction has emerged as one of the significant preprocessing steps in machine learning applications and has been effective in removing inappropriate data, increasing learning accuracy, and improving comprehensibility. Feature redundancy exercises great influence on the performance of classification process. Towards the better classification performance, this paper addresses the usefulness of truncating the highly correlated and redundant attributes. Here, an effort has been made to verify the utility of dimensionality reduction by applying LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) method on two Benchmark datasets of 'Pima Indian Diabetic patients' and 'Lung cancer patients'."}
{"text": "  A key problem in sensor networks is to decide which sensors to query when, in order to obtain the most useful information (e.g., for performing accurate prediction), subject to constraints (e.g., on power and bandwidth). In many applications the utility function is not known a priori, must be learned from data, and can even change over time. Furthermore for large sensor networks solving a centralized optimization problem to select sensors is not feasible, and thus we seek a fully distributed solution. In this paper, we present Distributed Online Greedy (DOG), an efficient, distributed algorithm for repeatedly selecting sensors online, only receiving feedback about the utility of the selected sensors. We prove very strong theoretical no-regret guarantees that apply whenever the (unknown) utility function satisfies a natural diminishing returns property called submodularity. Our algorithm has extremely low communication requirements, and scales well to large sensor deployments. We extend DOG to allow observation-dependent sensor selection. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several real-world sensing tasks."}
{"text": "  We assume data independently sampled from a mixture distribution on the unit ball of the D-dimensional Euclidean space with K+1 components: the first component is a uniform distribution on that ball representing outliers and the other K components are uniform distributions along K d-dimensional linear subspaces restricted to that ball. We study both the simultaneous recovery of all K underlying subspaces and the recovery of the best l0 subspace (i.e., with largest number of points) by minimizing the lp-averaged distances of data points from d-dimensional subspaces of the D-dimensional space. Unlike other lp minimization problems, this minimization is non-convex for all p>0 and thus requires different methods for its analysis. We show that if 0<p <= 1, then both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace can be precisely recovered by lp minimization with overwhelming probability. This result extends to additive homoscedastic uniform noise around the subspaces (i.e., uniform distribution in a strip around them) and near recovery with an error proportional to the noise level. On the other hand, if K>1 and p>1, then we show that both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace cannot be recovered and even nearly recovered. Further relaxations are also discussed. We use the results of this paper for partially justifying recent effective algorithms for modeling data by mixtures of multiple subspaces as well as for discussing the effect of using variants of lp minimizations in RANSAC-type strategies for single subspace recovery."}

Kutin and Niyogi proved that ERM on finite hypothesis spaces containing a unique risk minimizer has training stability that scales exponentially with sample size, and conjectured that the existence of multiple risk minimizers prevents even super-quadratic convergence. We prove this result for the strictly weaker notion of CV-stability, positively resolving the conjecture."}
{"text": "  We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be significantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly. We introduce a weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer that works well also with non-uniform sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the (highly non-uniformly sampled) Netflix dataset."}
{"text": "  We introduce a natural generalization of submodular set cover and exact active learning with a finite hypothesis class (query learning). We call this new problem interactive submodular set cover. Applications include advertising in social networks with hidden information. We give an approximation guarantee for a novel greedy algorithm and give a hardness of approximation result which matches up to constant factors. We also discuss negative results for simpler approaches and present encouraging early experimental results."}
{"text": "  Independent component analysis (ICA) aims at decomposing an observed random vector into statistically independent variables. Deflation-based implementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its variants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method for deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper. This simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of the kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of the contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed algebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical benefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and complex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of prewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local extrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational cost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for short data records. These features are demonstrated by a comparative numerical analysis on synthetic data. RobustICA's capabilities in processing real-world data involving noncircular complex strongly super-Gaussian sources are illustrated by the biomedical problem of atrial activity (AA) extraction in atrial fibrillation (AF) electrocardiograms (ECGs), where it outperforms an alternative ICA-based technique."}
{"text": "  India is a multi-lingual country where Roman script is often used alongside different Indic scripts in a text document. To develop a script specific handwritten Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, it is therefore necessary to identify the scripts of handwritten text correctly. In this paper, we present a system, which automatically separates the scripts of handwritten words from a document, written in Bangla or Devanagri mixed with Roman scripts. In this script separation technique, we first, extract the text lines and words from document pages using a script independent Neighboring Component Analysis technique. Then we have designed a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier for script separation, trained with 8 different wordlevel holistic features. Two equal sized datasets, one with Bangla and Roman scripts and the other with Devanagri and Roman scripts, are prepared for the system evaluation. On respective independent text samples, word-level script identification accuracies of 99.29% and 98.43% are achieved."}
{"text": "  We address the problem of learning in an online, bandit setting where the learner must repeatedly select among $K$ actions, but only receives partial feedback based on its choices. We establish two new facts: First, using a new algorithm called Exp4.P, we show that it is possible to compete with the best in a set of $N$ experts with probability $1-\\delta$ while incurring regret at most $O(\\sqrt{KT\\ln(N/\\delta)})$ over $T$ time steps. The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension $d$ while incurring regret at most $O(\\sqrt{T(d\\ln(T) + \\ln (1/\\delta))})$ with probability $1-\\delta$. These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for the contextual bandit setting."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new online convex optimization algorithm that adaptively chooses its regularization function based on the loss functions observed so far. This is in contrast to previous algorithms that use a fixed regularization function such as L2-squared, and modify it only via a single time-dependent parameter. Our algorithm's regret bounds are worst-case optimal, and for certain realistic classes of loss functions they are much better than existing bounds. These bounds are problem-dependent, which means they can exploit the structure of the actual problem instance. Critically, however, our algorithm does not need to know this structure in advance. Rather, we prove competitive guarantees that show the algorithm provides a bound within a constant factor of the best possible bound (of a certain functional form) in hindsight."}
{"text": "  Semisupervised learning has emerged as a popular framework for improving modeling accuracy while controlling labeling cost. Based on an extension of stochastic composite likelihood we quantify the asymptotic accuracy of generative semi-supervised learning. In doing so, we complement distribution-free analysis by providing an alternative framework to measure the value associated with different labeling policies and resolve the fundamental question of how much data to label and in what manner. We demonstrate our approach with both simulation studies and real world experiments using naive Bayes for text classification and MRFs and CRFs for structured prediction in NLP."}
{"text": "  Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications, especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.). It is to be expected in such cases that learning algorithms will have to deal with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the handling of malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution we analyze the performance of a particular method -- online centroid anomaly detection -- in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, analysis of its efficiency and constraints. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly under different conditions: bounded and unbounded percentage of traffic, and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation carried out on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and practicality of our protection mechanisms."}
{"text": "  Many popular linear classifiers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally, these risk functions are computed based on a labeled dataset. We develop a novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional datasets and demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating classifiers in transfer learning, and for training classifiers with no labeled data whatsoever."}
{"text": "  A key issue in statistics and machine learning is to automatically select the \"right\" model complexity, e.g., the number of neighbors to be averaged over in k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the polynomial degree in regression with polynomials. We suggest a novel principle - the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) - for model selection in regression and classification. It is based on the loss rank, which counts how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better. LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized maximum likelihood variants (AIC, BIC, MDL), LoRP depends only on the regression functions and the loss function. It works without a stochastic noise model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like kNN."}
{"text": "  Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random fields. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators when the computational resources are insufficient. They also demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy."}
{"text": "  We present an approach to semi-supervised learning based on an exponential family characterization. Our approach generalizes previous work on coupled priors for hybrid generative/discriminative models. Our model is more flexible and natural than previous approaches. Experimental results on several data sets show that our approach also performs better in practice."}
{"text": "  We introduce supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), a statistical model of labelled documents. The model accommodates a variety of response types. We derive an approximate maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation, which relies on variational methods to handle intractable posterior expectations. Prediction problems motivate this research: we use the fitted model to predict response values for new documents. We test sLDA on two real-world problems: movie ratings predicted from reviews, and the political tone of amendments in the U.S. Senate based on the amendment text. We illustrate the benefits of sLDA versus modern regularized regression, as well as versus an unsupervised LDA analysis followed by a separate regression."}
{"text": "  In recent years, predicting the user's next request in web navigation has received much attention. An information source to be used for dealing with such problem is the left information by the previous web users stored at the web access log on the web servers. Purposed systems for this problem work based on this idea that if a large number of web users request specific pages of a website on a given session, it can be concluded that these pages are satisfying similar information needs, and therefore they are conceptually related. In this study, a new clustering approach is introduced that employs logical path storing of a website pages as another parameter which is regarded as a similarity parameter and conceptual relation between web pages. The results of simulation have shown that the proposed approach is more than others precise in determining the clusters."}
{"text": "  Most Web page classification models typically apply the bag of words (BOW) model to represent the feature space. The original BOW representation, however, is unable to recognize semantic relationships between terms. One possible solution is to apply the topic model approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to cluster the term features into a set of latent topics. Terms assigned into the same topic are semantically related. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical classification method based on a topic model and by integrating additional term features from neighboring pages. Our hierarchical classification method consists of two phases: (1) feature representation by using a topic model and integrating neighboring pages, and (2) hierarchical Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification model constructed from a confusion matrix. From the experimental results, the approach of using the proposed hierarchical SVM model by integrating current page with neighboring pages via the topic model yielded the best performance with the accuracy equal to 90.33% and the F1 measure of 90.14%; an improvement of 5.12% and 5.13% over the original SVM model, respectively."}
{"text": "  We apply the method of defensive forecasting, based on the use of game-theoretic supermartingales, to prediction with expert advice. In the traditional setting of a countable number of experts and a finite number of outcomes, the Defensive Forecasting Algorithm is very close to the well-known Aggregating Algorithm. Not only the performance guarantees but also the predictions are the same for these two methods of fundamentally different nature. We discuss also a new setting where the experts can give advice conditional on the learner's future decision. Both the algorithms can be adapted to the new setting and give the same performance guarantees as in the traditional setting. Finally, we outline an application of defensive forecasting to a setting with several loss functions."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of allocating stocks to dark pools. We propose and analyze an optimal approach for allocations, if continuous-valued allocations are allowed. We also propose a modification for the case when only integer-valued allocations are possible. We extend the previous work on this problem to adversarial scenarios, while also improving on their results in the iid setup. The resulting algorithms are efficient, and perform well in simulations under stochastic and adversarial inputs."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel algorithm for greedy forward feature selection for regularized least-squares (RLS) regression and classification, also known as the least-squares support vector machine or ridge regression. The algorithm, which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition. We experimentally demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm and its ability to find good quality feature sets."}
{"text": "  The class of Schoenberg transformations, embedding Euclidean distances into higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, is presented, and derived from theorems on positive definite and conditionally negative definite matrices. Original results on the arc lengths, angles and curvature of the transformations are proposed, and visualized on artificial data sets by classical multidimensional scaling. A simple distance-based discriminant algorithm illustrates the theory, intimately connected to the Gaussian kernels of Machine Learning."}
{"text": "  The present contribution suggests the use of a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm as a visualization tool for manifold-valued elements. A visualization tool of this kind is useful in signal processing and machine learning whenever learning/adaptation algorithms insist on high-dimensional parameter manifolds."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes a novel similarity measure for clustering sequential data. We first construct a common state-space by training a single probabilistic model with all the sequences in order to get a unified representation for the dataset. Then, distances are obtained attending to the transition matrices induced by each sequence in that state-space. This approach solves some of the usual overfitting and scalability issues of the existing semi-parametric techniques, that rely on training a model for each sequence. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the advantages of the proposed similarity measure for clustering sequences."}
{"text": "  In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to $2\\lambda/n$, where $\\lambda$ is the real log canonical threshold and $n$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion."}
{"text": "  In this paper we formulate in general terms an approach to prove strong consistency of the Empirical Risk Minimisation inductive principle applied to the prototype or distance based clustering. This approach was motivated by the Divisive Information-Theoretic Feature Clustering model in probabilistic space with Kullback-Leibler divergence which may be regarded as a special case within the Clustering Minimisation framework. Also, we propose clustering regularization restricting creation of additional clusters which are not significant or are not essentially different comparing with existing clusters."}
{"text": "  We present a solution to the problem of understanding a system that produces a sequence of temporally ordered observations. Our solution is based on generating and interpreting a set of temporal decision rules. A temporal decision rule is a decision rule that can be used to predict or retrodict the value of a decision attribute, using condition attributes that are observed at times other than the decision attribute's time of observation. A rule set, consisting of a set of temporal decision rules with the same decision attribute, can be interpreted by our Temporal Investigation Method for Enregistered Record Sequences (TIMERS) to signify an instantaneous, an acausal or a possibly causal relationship between the condition attributes and the decision attribute. We show the effectiveness of our method, by describing a number of experiments with both synthetic and real temporal data."}
{"text": "  In this work we investigate the relationship between Bregman distances and regularized Logistic Regression model. We present a detailed study of Bregman Distance minimization, a family of generalized entropy measures associated with convex functions. We convert the L1-regularized logistic regression into this more general framework and propose a primal-dual method based algorithm for learning the parameters. We pose L1-regularized logistic regression into Bregman distance minimization and then apply non-linear constrained optimization techniques to estimate the parameters of the logistic model."}
{"text": "  We describe and analyze efficient algorithms for learning a linear predictor from examples when the learner can only view a few attributes of each training example. This is the case, for instance, in medical research, where each patient participating in the experiment is only willing to go through a small number of tests. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufficient to compensate for the lack of full information on each training example. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms by showing that when running on digit recognition data, they obtain a high prediction accuracy even when the learner gets to see only four pixels of each image."}
{"text": "  In this paper we consider sparse and identifiable linear latent variable (factor) and linear Bayesian network models for parsimonious analysis of multivariate data. We propose a computationally efficient method for joint parameter and model inference, and model comparison. It consists of a fully Bayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component delta-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a stochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we call SLIM (Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling), is validated and bench-marked on artificial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in spirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in inference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison. Experimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with comparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic search strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identifiability), which is an explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d. linear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM (Sparse Non-linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for correlations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the temporal and/or spatial data. The source code and scripts are available from http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/slim/."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel problem formulation of learning a single task when the data are provided in different feature spaces. Each such space is called an outlook, and is assumed to contain both labeled and unlabeled data. The objective is to take advantage of the data from all the outlooks to better classify each of the outlooks. We devise an algorithm that computes optimal affine mappings from different outlooks to a target outlook by matching moments of the empirical distributions. We further derive a probabilistic interpretation of the resulting algorithm and a sample complexity bound indicating how many samples are needed to adequately find the mapping. We report the results of extensive experiments on activity recognition tasks that show the value of the proposed approach in boosting performance."}
{"text": "  In Bayesian machine learning, conjugate priors are popular, mostly due to mathematical convenience. In this paper, we show that there are deeper reasons for choosing a conjugate prior. Specifically, we formulate the conjugate prior in the form of Bregman divergence and show that it is the inherent geometry of conjugate priors that makes them appropriate and intuitive. This geometric interpretation allows one to view the hyperparameters of conjugate priors as the {\\it effective} sample points, thus providing additional intuition. We use this geometric understanding of conjugate priors to derive the hyperparameters and expression of the prior used to couple the generative and discriminative components of a hybrid model for semi-supervised learning."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the distributive queue-aware power and subband allocation design for a delay-optimal OFDMA uplink system with one base station, $K$ users and $N_F$ independent subbands. Each mobile has an uplink queue with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We model the problem as an infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Problem (MDP) where the control actions are functions of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) as well as the joint Queue State Information (QSI). To address the distributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory requirement and computational complexity, we approximate the subband allocation Q-factor by the sum of the per-user subband allocation Q-factor and derive a distributive online stochastic learning algorithm to estimate the per-user Q-factor and the Lagrange multipliers (LM) simultaneously and determine the control actions using an auction mechanism. We show that under the proposed auction mechanism, the distributive online learning converges almost surely (with probability 1). For illustration, we apply the proposed distributive stochastic learning framework to an application example with exponential packet size distribution. We show that the delay-optimal power control has the {\\em multi-level water-filling} structure where the CSI determines the instantaneous power allocation and the QSI determines the water-level. The proposed algorithm has linear signaling overhead and computational complexity $\\mathcal O(KN)$, which is desirable from an implementation perspective."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a method for automated healing as part of off-line automated troubleshooting. The method combines statistical learning with constraint optimization. The automated healing aims at locally optimizing radio resource management (RRM) or system parameters of cells with poor performance in an iterative manner. The statistical learning processes the data using Logistic Regression (LR) to extract closed form (functional) relations between Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Radio Resource Management (RRM) parameters. These functional relations are then processed by an optimization engine which proposes new parameter values. The advantage of the proposed formulation is the small number of iterations required by the automated healing method to converge, making it suitable for off-line implementation. The proposed method is applied to heal an Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) process in a 3G Long Term Evolution (LTE) network which is based on soft-frequency reuse scheme. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Although the real reproducing kernels are used in an increasing number of machine learning problems, complex kernels have not, yet, been used, in spite of their potential interest in applications such as communications. In this work, we focus our attention on the complex gaussian kernel and its possible application in the complex Kernel LMS algorithm. In order to derive the gradients needed to develop the complex kernel LMS (CKLMS), we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted much attention in the signal processing community. Writinger's calculus simplifies computations and offers an elegant tool for treating complex signals. To this end, the notion of Writinger's calculus is extended to include complex RKHSs. Experiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements over the traditional complex LMS or Widely Linear complex LMS (WL-LMS) algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities."}
{"text": "  Over the last decade, kernel methods for nonlinear processing have successfully been used in the machine learning community. However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch techniques. It is only recently, that online adaptive techniques have been considered in the context of signal processing tasks. To the best of our knowledge, no kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, that is able to deal with complex valued signals. In this paper, we take advantage of a technique called complexification of real RKHSs to attack this problem. In order to derive gradients and subgradients of operators that need to be defined on the associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool ofWirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted much attention in the signal processing community. Writinger's calculus simplifies computations and offers an elegant tool for treating complex signals. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Writinger's calculus is extended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive the Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm. Experiments verify that the CKLMS can be used to derive nonlinear stable algorithms, which offer significant performance improvements over the traditional complex LMS orWidely Linear complex LMS (WL-LMS) algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities."}
{"text": "  We introduce an efficient method for training the linear ranking support vector machine. The method combines cutting plane optimization with red-black tree based approach to subgradient calculations, and has O(m*s+m*log(m)) time complexity, where m is the number of training examples, and s the average number of non-zero features per example. Best previously known training algorithms achieve the same efficiency only for restricted special cases, whereas the proposed approach allows any real valued utility scores in the training data. Experiments demonstrate the superior scalability of the proposed approach, when compared to the fastest existing RankSVM implementations."}
{"text": "  The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma allows for the projection of $n$ points in $p-$dimensional Euclidean space onto a $k-$dimensional Euclidean space, with $k \\ge \\frac{24\\ln \\emph{n}}{3\\epsilon^2-2\\epsilon^3}$, so that the pairwise distances are preserved within a factor of $1\\pm\\epsilon$. Here, working directly with the distributions of the random distances rather than resorting to the moment generating function technique, an improvement on the lower bound for $k$ is obtained. The additional reduction in dimension when compared to bounds found in the literature, is at least $13\\%$, and, in some cases, up to $30\\%$ additional reduction is achieved. Using the moment generating function technique, we further provide a lower bound for $k$ using pairwise $L_2$ distances in the space of points to be projected and pairwise $L_1$ distances in the space of the projected points. Comparison with the results obtained in the literature shows that the bound presented here provides an additional $36-40\\%$ reduction."}
{"text": "  Semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs) are a kind of popular approaches which try to improve learning performance by exploiting unlabeled data. Though S3VMs have been found helpful in many situations, they may degenerate performance and the resultant generalization ability may be even worse than using the labeled data only. In this paper, we try to reduce the chance of performance degeneration of S3VMs. Our basic idea is that, rather than exploiting all unlabeled data, the unlabeled instances should be selected such that only the ones which are very likely to be helpful are exploited, while some highly risky unlabeled instances are avoided. We propose the S3VM-\\emph{us} method by using hierarchical clustering to select the unlabeled instances. Experiments on a broad range of data sets over eighty-eight different settings show that the chance of performance degeneration of S3VM-\\emph{us} is much smaller than that of existing S3VMs."}
{"text": "  We improve recently published results about resources of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) required to make them Universal Approximators. We show that any distribution p on the set of binary vectors of length n can be arbitrarily well approximated by an RBM with k-1 hidden units, where k is the minimal number of pairs of binary vectors differing in only one entry such that their union contains the support set of p. In important cases this number is half of the cardinality of the support set of p. We construct a DBN with 2^n/2(n-b), b ~ log(n), hidden layers of width n that is capable of approximating any distribution on {0,1}^n arbitrarily well. This confirms a conjecture presented by Le Roux and Bengio 2010."}
{"text": "  We study prediction with expert advice in the setting where the losses are accumulated with some discounting---the impact of old losses may gradually vanish. We generalize the Aggregating Algorithm and the Aggregating Algorithm for Regression to this case, propose a suitable new variant of exponential weights algorithm, and prove respective loss bounds."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we formulate a novel problem for finding blackhole and volcano patterns in a large directed graph. Specifically, a blackhole pattern is a group which is made of a set of nodes in a way such that there are only inlinks to this group from the rest nodes in the graph. In contrast, a volcano pattern is a group which only has outlinks to the rest nodes in the graph. Both patterns can be observed in real world. For instance, in a trading network, a blackhole pattern may represent a group of traders who are manipulating the market. In the paper, we first prove that the blackhole mining problem is a dual problem of finding volcanoes. Therefore, we focus on finding the blackhole patterns. Along this line, we design two pruning schemes to guide the blackhole finding process. In the first pruning scheme, we strategically prune the search space based on a set of pattern-size-independent pruning rules and develop an iBlackhole algorithm. The second pruning scheme follows a divide-and-conquer strategy to further exploit the pruning results from the first pruning scheme. Indeed, a target directed graphs can be divided into several disconnected subgraphs by the first pruning scheme, and thus the blackhole finding can be conducted in each disconnected subgraph rather than in a large graph. Based on these two pruning schemes, we also develop an iBlackhole-DC algorithm. Finally, experimental results on real-world data show that the iBlackhole-DC algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than the iBlackhole algorithm, which has a huge computational advantage over a brute-force method."}
{"text": "  We derive generalization bounds for learning algorithms based on their robustness: the property that if a testing sample is \"similar\" to a training sample, then the testing error is close to the training error. This provides a novel approach, different from the complexity or stability arguments, to study generalization of learning algorithms. We further show that a weak notion of robustness is both sufficient and necessary for generalizability, which implies that robustness is a fundamental property for learning algorithms to work."}
{"text": "  We study online learning when individual instances are corrupted by adversarially chosen random noise. We assume the noise distribution is unknown, and may change over time with no restriction other than having zero mean and bounded variance. Our technique relies on a family of unbiased estimators for non-linear functions, which may be of independent interest. We show that a variant of online gradient descent can learn functions in any dot-product (e.g., polynomial) or Gaussian kernel space with any analytic convex loss function. Our variant uses randomized estimates that need to query a random number of noisy copies of each instance, where with high probability this number is upper bounded by a constant. Allowing such multiple queries cannot be avoided: Indeed, we show that online learning is in general impossible when only one noisy copy of each instance can be accessed."}
{"text": "  We consider the question of the stability of evolutionary algorithms to gradual changes, or drift, in the target concept. We define an algorithm to be resistant to drift if, for some inverse polynomial drift rate in the target function, it converges to accuracy 1 -- \\epsilon , with polynomial resources, and then stays within that accuracy indefinitely, except with probability \\epsilon , at any one time. We show that every evolution algorithm, in the sense of Valiant (2007; 2009), can be converted using the Correlational Query technique of Feldman (2008), into such a drift resistant algorithm. For certain evolutionary algorithms, such as for Boolean conjunctions, we give bounds on the rates of drift that they can resist. We develop some new evolution algorithms that are resistant to significant drift. In particular, we give an algorithm for evolving linear separators over the spherically symmetric distribution that is resistant to a drift rate of O(\\epsilon /n), and another algorithm over the more general product normal distributions that resists a smaller drift rate.   The above translation result can be also interpreted as one on the robustness of the notion of evolvability itself under changes of definition. As a second result in that direction we show that every evolution algorithm can be converted to a quasi-monotonic one that can evolve from any starting point without the performance ever dipping significantly below that of the starting point. This permits the somewhat unnatural feature of arbitrary performance degradations to be removed from several known robustness translations."}
{"text": "  We describe and analyze a new algorithm for agnostically learning kernel-based halfspaces with respect to the \\emph{zero-one} loss function. Unlike most previous formulations which rely on surrogate convex loss functions (e.g. hinge-loss in SVM and log-loss in logistic regression), we provide finite time/sample guarantees with respect to the more natural zero-one loss function. The proposed algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in worst-case time $\\poly(\\exp(L\\log(L/\\epsilon)))$, for $\\emph{any}$ distribution, where $L$ is a Lipschitz constant (which can be thought of as the reciprocal of the margin), and the learned classifier is worse than the optimal halfspace by at most $\\epsilon$. We also prove a hardness result, showing that under a certain cryptographic assumption, no algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in time polynomial in $L$."}
{"text": "  This paper provides a theoretical explanation on the clustering aspect of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We prove that even without imposing orthogonality nor sparsity constraint on the basis and/or coefficient matrix, NMF still can give clustering results, thus providing a theoretical support for many works, e.g., Xu et al. [1] and Kim et al. [2], that show the superiority of the standard NMF as a clustering method."}
{"text": "  The sample complexity of active learning under the realizability assumption has been well-studied. The realizability assumption, however, rarely holds in practice. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the sample complexity of active learning in the non-realizable case under multi-view setting. We prove that, with unbounded Tsybakov noise, the sample complexity of multi-view active learning can be $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, contrasting to single-view setting where the polynomial improvement is the best possible achievement. We also prove that in general multi-view setting the sample complexity of active learning with unbounded Tsybakov noise is $\\widetilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, where the order of $1/\\epsilon$ is independent of the parameter in Tsybakov noise, contrasting to previous polynomial bounds where the order of $1/\\epsilon$ is related to the parameter in Tsybakov noise."}
{"text": "  In the framework of prediction with expert advice, we consider a recently introduced kind of regret bounds: the bounds that depend on the effective instead of nominal number of experts. In contrast to the NormalHedge bound, which mainly depends on the effective number of experts and also weakly depends on the nominal one, we obtain a bound that does not contain the nominal number of experts at all. We use the defensive forecasting method and introduce an application of defensive forecasting to multivalued supermartingales."}
{"text": "  Exchangeable random variables form an important and well-studied generalization of i.i.d. variables, however simple examples show that no nontrivial concept or function classes are PAC learnable under general exchangeable data inputs $X_1,X_2,\\ldots$. Inspired by the work of Berti and Rigo on a Glivenko--Cantelli theorem for exchangeable inputs, we propose a new paradigm, adequate for learning from exchangeable data: predictive PAC learnability. A learning rule $\\mathcal L$ for a function class $\\mathscr F$ is predictive PAC if for every $\\e,\\delta>0$ and each function $f\\in {\\mathscr F}$, whenever $\\abs{\\sigma}\\geq s(\\delta,\\e)$, we have with confidence $1-\\delta$ that the expected difference between $f(X_{n+1})$ and the image of $f\\vert\\sigma$ under $\\mathcal L$ does not exceed $\\e$ conditionally on $X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$. Thus, instead of learning the function $f$ as such, we are learning to a given accuracy $\\e$ the predictive behaviour of $f$ at the future points $X_i(\\omega)$, $i>n$ of the sample path. Using de Finetti's theorem, we show that if a universally separable function class $\\mathscr F$ is distribution-free PAC learnable under i.i.d. inputs, then it is distribution-free predictive PAC learnable under exchangeable inputs, with a slightly worse sample complexity."}
{"text": "  The paper addresses the problem of learning a regression model parameterized by a fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrix. The focus is on the nonlinear nature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The mathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms adapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the literature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned matrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem size and enjoy important invariance properties. We apply the proposed algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function parameterized by a positive semidefinite matrix. Good performance is observed on classical benchmarks."}
{"text": "  In dyadic prediction, labels must be predicted for pairs (dyads) whose members possess unique identifiers and, sometimes, additional features called side-information. Special cases of this problem include collaborative filtering and link prediction. We present the first model for dyadic prediction that satisfies several important desiderata: (i) labels may be ordinal or nominal, (ii) side-information can be easily exploited if present, (iii) with or without side-information, latent features are inferred for dyad members, (iv) it is resistant to sample-selection bias, (v) it can learn well-calibrated probabilities, and (vi) it can scale to very large datasets. To our knowledge, no existing method satisfies all the above criteria. In particular, many methods assume that the labels are ordinal and ignore side-information when it is present. Experimental results show that the new method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for the special cases of collaborative filtering and link prediction, and that it makes accurate predictions on nominal data."}
{"text": "  We present and analyze an agnostic active learning algorithm that works without keeping a version space. This is unlike all previous approaches where a restricted set of candidate hypotheses is maintained throughout learning, and only hypotheses from this set are ever returned. By avoiding this version space approach, our algorithm sheds the computational burden and brittleness associated with maintaining version spaces, yet still allows for substantial improvements over supervised learning for classification."}
{"text": "  Over the last decade, kernel methods for nonlinear processing have successfully been used in the machine learning community. The primary mathematical tool employed in these methods is the notion of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch techniques. It is only recently, that online techniques have been considered in the context of adaptive signal processing tasks. Moreover, these efforts have only been focussed on real valued data sequences. To the best of our knowledge, no adaptive kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, for complex valued signals. Furthermore, although the real reproducing kernels are used in an increasing number of machine learning problems, complex kernels have not, yet, been used, in spite of their potential interest in applications that deal with complex signals, with Communications being a typical example. In this paper, we present a general framework to attack the problem of adaptive filtering of complex signals, using either real reproducing kernels, taking advantage of a technique called \\textit{complexification} of real RKHSs, or complex reproducing kernels, highlighting the use of the complex gaussian kernel. In order to derive gradients of operators that need to be defined on the associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted attention in the signal processing community. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Wirtinger's calculus is extended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive several realizations of the Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm. Experiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements over several linear and nonlinear algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities."}
{"text": "  A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include $K$-fold cross-validation ($K$-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including $K$-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures."}
{"text": "  Density modeling is notoriously difficult for high dimensional data. One approach to the problem is to search for a lower dimensional manifold which captures the main characteristics of the data. Recently, the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) has successfully been used to find low dimensional manifolds in a variety of complex data. The GPLVM consists of a set of points in a low dimensional latent space, and a stochastic map to the observed space. We show how it can be interpreted as a density model in the observed space. However, the GPLVM is not trained as a density model and therefore yields bad density estimates. We propose a new training strategy and obtain improved generalisation performance and better density estimates in comparative evaluations on several benchmark data sets."}
{"text": "  This paper studies the MINLIP estimator for the identification of Wiener systems consisting of a sequence of a linear FIR dynamical model, and a monotonically increasing (or decreasing) static function. Given $T$ observations, this algorithm boils down to solving a convex quadratic program with $O(T)$ variables and inequality constraints, implementing an inference technique which is based entirely on model complexity control. The resulting estimates of the linear submodel are found to be almost consistent when no noise is present in the data, under a condition of smoothness of the true nonlinearity and local Persistency of Excitation (local PE) of the data. This result is novel as it does not rely on classical tools as a 'linearization' using a Taylor decomposition, nor exploits stochastic properties of the data. It is indicated how to extend the method to cope with noisy data, and empirical evidence contrasts performance of the estimator against other recently proposed techniques."}
{"text": "  In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a necessary and sufficient condition for distribution-free PAC learnability of a concept class $\\mathscr C$ under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the domain $\\Omega$. Clearly, finiteness of the classical Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of $\\mathscr C$ is a sufficient, but no longer necessary, condition. Besides, learnability of $\\mathscr C$ under non-atomic measures does not imply the uniform Glivenko-Cantelli property with regard to non-atomic measures. Our learnability criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter $\\VC({\\mathscr C}\\,{\\mathrm{mod}}\\,\\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by ``thickening up'' single points in the definition of VC dimension to uncountable ``clusters''. Equivalently, $\\VC(\\mathscr C\\modd\\omega_1)\\leq d$ if and only if every countable subclass of $\\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\\leq d$ outside a countable subset of $\\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed as the classical VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset of a compactification of $\\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions on $\\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA)."}
{"text": "  We present a new latent-variable model employing a Gaussian mixture integrated with a feature selection procedure (the Bernoulli part of the model) which together form a \"Latent Bernoulli-Gauss\" distribution. The model is applied to MAP estimation, clustering, feature selection and collaborative filtering and fares favorably with the state-of-the-art latent-variable models."}
{"text": "  We address in this paper the problem of multi-channel signal sequence labeling. In particular, we consider the problem where the signals are contaminated by noise or may present some dephasing with respect to their labels. For that, we propose to jointly learn a SVM sample classifier with a temporal filtering of the channels. This will lead to a large margin filtering that is adapted to the specificity of each channel (noise and time-lag). We derive algorithms to solve the optimization problem and we discuss different filter regularizations for automated scaling or selection of channels. Our approach is tested on a non-linear toy example and on a BCI dataset. Results show that the classification performance on these problems can be improved by learning a large margin filtering."}
{"text": "  We define a class of Euclidean distances on weighted graphs, enabling to perform thermodynamic soft graph clustering. The class can be constructed form the \"raw coordinates\" encountered in spectral clustering, and can be extended by means of higher-dimensional embeddings (Schoenberg transformations). Geographical flow data, properly conditioned, illustrate the procedure as well as visualization aspects."}
{"text": "  A popular method for selecting the number of clusters is based on stability arguments: one chooses the number of clusters such that the corresponding clustering results are \"most stable\". In recent years, a series of papers has analyzed the behavior of this method from a theoretical point of view. However, the results are very technical and difficult to interpret for non-experts. In this paper we give a high-level overview about the existing literature on clustering stability. In addition to presenting the results in a slightly informal but accessible way, we relate them to each other and discuss their different implications."}
{"text": "  We show that the learning sample complexity of a sigmoidal neural network constructed by Sontag (1992) required to achieve a given misclassification error under a fixed purely atomic distribution can grow arbitrarily fast: for any prescribed rate of growth there is an input distribution having this rate as the sample complexity, and the bound is asymptotically tight. The rate can be superexponential, a non-recursive function, etc. We further observe that Sontag's ANN is not Glivenko-Cantelli under any input distribution having a non-atomic part."}
{"text": "  This paper introduces a principled approach for the design of a scalable general reinforcement learning agent. This approach is based on a direct approximation of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement learning agents. Previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of AIXI could motivate the design of practical algorithms. We answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension of the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a set of encouraging results on a number of stochastic, unknown, and partially observable domains."}
{"text": "  Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from multi-object tracking to ranking of instances. The difficulty of dealing with these distributions is caused by the size of their domain, which is factorial in the number of considered entities ($n!$). It makes the direct definition of a multinomial distribution over permutation space impractical for all but a very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in $\\mathbbm{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result of the embedding, we acquire ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of directional statistics. We provide polynomial time projections between the continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space. The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations. As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations. We demonstrate the approach with applications."}
{"text": "  Supervised linear feature extraction can be achieved by fitting a reduced rank multivariate model. This paper studies rank penalized and rank constrained vector generalized linear models. From the perspective of thresholding rules, we build a framework for fitting singular value penalized models and use it for feature extraction. Through solving the rank constraint form of the problem, we propose progressive feature space reduction for fast computation in high dimensions with little performance loss. A novel projective cross-validation is proposed for parameter tuning in such nonconvex setups. Real data applications are given to show the power of the methodology in supervised dimension reduction and feature extraction."}
{"text": "  Search engines today present results that are often oblivious to abrupt shifts in intent. For example, the query `independence day' usually refers to a US holiday, but the intent of this query abruptly changed during the release of a major film by that name. While no studies exactly quantify the magnitude of intent-shifting traffic, studies suggest that news events, seasonal topics, pop culture, etc account for 50% of all search queries. This paper shows that the signals a search engine receives can be used to both determine that a shift in intent has happened, as well as find a result that is now more relevant. We present a meta-algorithm that marries a classifier with a bandit algorithm to achieve regret that depends logarithmically on the number of query impressions, under certain assumptions. We provide strong evidence that this regret is close to the best achievable. Finally, via a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms prior approaches, particularly as the amount of intent-shifting traffic increases."}
{"text": "  Support vector machines (SVMs) are special kernel based methods and belong to the most successful learning methods since more than a decade. SVMs can informally be described as a kind of regularized M-estimators for functions and have demonstrated their usefulness in many complicated real-life problems. During the last years a great part of the statistical research on SVMs has concentrated on the question how to design SVMs such that they are universally consistent and statistically robust for nonparametric classification or nonparametric regression purposes. In many applications, some qualitative prior knowledge of the distribution P or of the unknown function f to be estimated is present or the prediction function with a good interpretability is desired, such that a semiparametric model or an additive model is of interest.   In this paper we mainly address the question how to design SVMs by choosing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) or its corresponding kernel to obtain consistent and statistically robust estimators in additive models. We give an explicit construction of kernels - and thus of their RKHSs - which leads in combination with a Lipschitz continuous loss function to consistent and statistically robust SMVs for additive models. Examples are quantile regression based on the pinball loss function, regression based on the epsilon-insensitive loss function, and classification based on the hinge loss function."}
{"text": "  Recently, applying the novel data mining techniques for evaluating enterprise financial distress has received much research alternation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and back propagation neural (BPN) network has been applied successfully in many areas with excellent generalization results, such as rule extraction, classification and evaluation. In this paper, a model based on SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel is proposed here for enterprise financial distress evaluation. BPN network is considered one of the simplest and are most general methods used for supervised training of multilayered neural network. The comparative results show that through the difference between the performance measures is marginal; SVM gives higher precision and lower error rates."}
{"text": "  Most image-search approaches today are based on the text based tags associated with the images which are mostly human generated and are subject to various kinds of errors. The results of a query to the image database thus can often be misleading and may not satisfy the requirements of the user. In this work we propose our approach to automate this tagging process of images, where image results generated can be fine filtered based on a probabilistic tagging mechanism. We implement a tool which helps to automate the tagging process by maintaining a training database, wherein the system is trained to identify certain set of input images, the results generated from which are used to create a probabilistic tagging mechanism. Given a certain set of segments in an image it calculates the probability of presence of particular keywords. This probability table is further used to generate the candidate tags for input images."}
{"text": "  We present a framework for discriminative sequence classification where the learner works directly in the high dimensional predictor space of all subsequences in the training set. This is possible by employing a new coordinate-descent algorithm coupled with bounding the magnitude of the gradient for selecting discriminative subsequences fast. We characterize the loss functions for which our generic learning algorithm can be applied and present concrete implementations for logistic regression (binomial log-likelihood loss) and support vector machines (squared hinge loss). Application of our algorithm to protein remote homology detection and remote fold recognition results in performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., kernel support vector machines). Unlike state-of-the-art classifiers, the resulting classification models are simply lists of weighted discriminative subsequences and can thus be interpreted and related to the biological problem."}
{"text": "  We present three generalisations of Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) which incorporate knowledge of the class labels of a subset of the data points. The first, MV-KPCA, penalises within class variances similar to Fisher discriminant analysis. The second, LSKPCA is a hybrid of least squares regression and kernel PCA. The final LR-KPCA is an iteratively reweighted version of the previous which achieves a sigmoid loss function on the labeled points. We provide a theoretical risk bound as well as illustrative experiments on real and toy data sets."}
{"text": "  In the last few years, many different performance measures have been introduced to overcome the weakness of the most natural metric, the Accuracy. Among them, Matthews Correlation Coefficient has recently gained popularity among researchers not only in machine learning but also in several application fields such as bioinformatics. Nonetheless, further novel functions are being proposed in literature. We show that Confusion Entropy, a recently introduced classifier performance measure for multi-class problems, has a strong (monotone) relation with the multi-class generalization of a classical metric, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Computational evidence in support of the claim is provided, together with an outline of the theoretical explanation."}
{"text": "  We propose a simple kernel based nearest neighbor approach for handwritten digit classification. The \"distance\" here is actually a kernel defining the similarity between two images. We carefully study the effects of different number of neighbors and weight schemes and report the results. With only a few nearest neighbors (or most similar images) to vote, the test set error rate on MNIST database could reach about 1.5%-2.0%, which is very close to many advanced models."}
{"text": "  Kernel Induced Random Survival Forests (KIRSF) is a statistical learning algorithm which aims to improve prediction accuracy for survival data. As in Random Survival Forests (RSF), Cumulative Hazard Function is predicted for each individual in the test set. Prediction error is estimated using Harrell's concordance index (C index) [Harrell et al. (1982)]. The C-index can be interpreted as a misclassification probability and does not depend on a single fixed time for evaluation. The C-index also specifically accounts for censoring. By utilizing kernel functions, KIRSF achieves better results than RSF in many situations. In this report, we show how to incorporate kernel functions into RSF. We test the performance of KIRSF and compare our method to RSF. We find that the KIRSF's performance is better than RSF in many occasions."}
{"text": "  In this paper the sequential prediction problem with expert advice is considered for the case where losses of experts suffered at each step cannot be bounded in advance. We present some modification of Kalai and Vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled fluctuation of a game are introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case when the scaled fluctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to zero."}
{"text": "  In prediction with expert advice the goal is to design online prediction algorithms that achieve small regret (additional loss on the whole data) compared to a reference scheme. In the simplest such scheme one compares to the loss of the best expert in hindsight. A more ambitious goal is to split the data into segments and compare to the best expert on each segment. This is appropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard fixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this scheme.   Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about how they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the following question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from data in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first case. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly when the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending fixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T outcomes. We show, however, that no such slowdown is necessary if the experts are hidden Markov models."}
{"text": "  A problem posed by Freund is how to efficiently track a small pool of experts out of a much larger set. This problem was solved when Bousquet and Warmuth introduced their mixing past posteriors (MPP) algorithm in 2001.   In Freund's problem the experts would normally be considered black boxes. However, in this paper we re-examine Freund's problem in case the experts have internal structure that enables them to learn. In this case the problem has two possible interpretations: should the experts learn from all data or only from the subsequence on which they are being tracked? The MPP algorithm solves the first case. Our contribution is to generalise MPP to address the second option. The results we obtain apply to any expert structure that can be formalised using (expert) hidden Markov models. Curiously enough, for our interpretation there are \\emph{two} natural reference schemes: freezing and sleeping. For each scheme, we provide an efficient prediction strategy and prove the relevant loss bound."}
{"text": "  Since learning is typically very slow in Boltzmann machines, there is a need to restrict connections within hidden layers. However, the resulting states of hidden units exhibit statistical dependencies. Based on this observation, we propose using $l_1/l_2$ regularization upon the activation possibilities of hidden units in restricted Boltzmann machines to capture the loacal dependencies among hidden units. This regularization not only encourages hidden units of many groups to be inactive given observed data but also makes hidden units within a group compete with each other for modeling observed data. Thus, the $l_1/l_2$ regularization on RBMs yields sparsity at both the group and the hidden unit levels. We call RBMs trained with the regularizer \\emph{sparse group} RBMs. The proposed sparse group RBMs are applied to three tasks: modeling patches of natural images, modeling handwritten digits and pretaining a deep networks for a classification task. Furthermore, we illustrate the regularizer can also be applied to deep Boltzmann machines, which lead to sparse group deep Boltzmann machines. When adapted to the MNIST data set, a two-layer sparse group Boltzmann machine achieves an error rate of $0.84\\%$, which is, to our knowledge, the best published result on the permutation-invariant version of the MNIST task."}
{"text": "  We sharply characterize the performance of different penalization schemes for the problem of selecting the relevant variables in the multi-task setting. Previous work focuses on the regression problem where conditions on the design matrix complicate the analysis. A clearer and simpler picture emerges by studying the Normal means model. This model, often used in the field of statistics, is a simplified model that provides a laboratory for studying complex procedures."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel feature selection strategy to discover language-independent acoustic features that tend to be responsible for emotions regardless of languages, linguistics and other factors. Experimental results suggest that the language-independent feature subset discovered yields the performance comparable to the full feature set on various emotional speech corpora."}
{"text": "  The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predefined) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed empirical evaluations using the breast cancer gene expression data set, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper efficient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using the L1-norm. Our method is efficient and scales gracefully to millions of variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: first, we consider fixed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where learned dictionary elements naturally organize in a prespecified arborescent structure, leading to a better performance in reconstruction of natural image patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models."}
{"text": "  This paper introduces an approach to Reinforcement Learning Algorithm by comparing their immediate rewards using a variation of Q-Learning algorithm. Unlike the conventional Q-Learning, the proposed algorithm compares current reward with immediate reward of past move and work accordingly. Relative reward based Q-learning is an approach towards interactive learning. Q-Learning is a model free reinforcement learning method that used to learn the agents. It is observed that under normal circumstances algorithm take more episodes to reach optimal Q-value due to its normal reward or sometime negative reward. In this new form of algorithm agents select only those actions which have a higher immediate reward signal in comparison to previous one. The contribution of this article is the presentation of new Q-Learning Algorithm in order to maximize the performance of algorithm and reduce the number of episode required to reach optimal Q-value. Effectiveness of proposed algorithm is simulated in a 20 x20 Grid world deterministic environment and the result for the two forms of Q-Learning Algorithms is given."}
{"text": "  We present surrogate regret bounds for arbitrary surrogate losses in the context of binary classification with label-dependent costs. Such bounds relate a classifier's risk, assessed with respect to a surrogate loss, to its cost-sensitive classification risk. Two approaches to surrogate regret bounds are developed. The first is a direct generalization of Bartlett et al. [2006], who focus on margin-based losses and cost-insensitive classification, while the second adopts the framework of Steinwart [2007] based on calibration functions. Nontrivial surrogate regret bounds are shown to exist precisely when the surrogate loss satisfies a \"calibration\" condition that is easily verified for many common losses. We apply this theory to the class of uneven margin losses, and characterize when these losses are properly calibrated. The uneven hinge, squared error, exponential, and sigmoid losses are then treated in detail."}
{"text": "  We study three families of online convex optimization algorithms: follow-the-proximally-regularized-leader (FTRL-Proximal), regularized dual averaging (RDA), and composite-objective mirror descent. We first prove equivalence theorems that show all of these algorithms are instantiations of a general FTRL update. This provides theoretical insight on previous experimental observations. In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent algorithm handles L1 regularization explicitly, it has been observed that RDA is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that FOBOS uses subgradient approximations to the L1 penalty from previous rounds, leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm can be seen as a hybrid of these two, and outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset.   Our second contribution is a unified analysis which produces regret bounds that match (up to logarithmic terms) or improve the best previously known bounds. This analysis also extends these algorithms in two important ways: we support a more general type of composite objective and we analyze implicit updates, which replace the subgradient approximation of the current loss function with an exact optimization."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel hybrid loss for multiclass and structured prediction problems that is a convex combination of log loss for Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and a multiclass hinge loss for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We provide a sufficient condition for when the hybrid loss is Fisher consistent for classification. This condition depends on a measure of dominance between labels - specifically, the gap in per observation probabilities between the most likely labels. We also prove Fisher consistency is necessary for parametric consistency when learning models such as CRFs.   We demonstrate empirically that the hybrid loss typically performs as least as well as - and often better than - both of its constituent losses on variety of tasks. In doing so we also provide an empirical comparison of the efficacy of probabilistic and margin based approaches to multiclass and structured prediction and the effects of label dominance on these results."}
{"text": "  In this paper we present a new algorithm for learning oblique decision trees. Most of the current decision tree algorithms rely on impurity measures to assess the goodness of hyperplanes at each node while learning a decision tree in a top-down fashion. These impurity measures do not properly capture the geometric structures in the data. Motivated by this, our algorithm uses a strategy to assess the hyperplanes in such a way that the geometric structure in the data is taken into account. At each node of the decision tree, we find the clustering hyperplanes for both the classes and use their angle bisectors as the split rule at that node. We show through empirical studies that this idea leads to small decision trees and better performance. We also present some analysis to show that the angle bisectors of clustering hyperplanes that we use as the split rules at each node, are solutions of an interesting optimization problem and hence argue that this is a principled method of learning a decision tree."}
{"text": "  Margin theory provides one of the most popular explanations to the success of \\texttt{AdaBoost}, where the central point lies in the recognition that \\textit{margin} is the key for characterizing the performance of \\texttt{AdaBoost}. This theory has been very influential, e.g., it has been used to argue that \\texttt{AdaBoost} usually does not overfit since it tends to enlarge the margin even after the training error reaches zero. Previously the \\textit{minimum margin bound} was established for \\texttt{AdaBoost}, however, \\cite{Breiman1999} pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin does not necessarily lead to a better generalization. Later, \\cite{Reyzin:Schapire2006} emphasized that the margin distribution rather than minimum margin is crucial to the performance of \\texttt{AdaBoost}. In this paper, we first present the \\textit{$k$th margin bound} and further study on its relationship to previous work such as the minimum margin bound and Emargin bound. Then, we improve the previous empirical Bernstein bounds \\citep{Maurer:Pontil2009,Audibert:Munos:Szepesvari2009}, and based on such findings, we defend the margin-based explanation against Breiman's doubts by proving a new generalization error bound that considers exactly the same factors as \\cite{Schapire:Freund:Bartlett:Lee1998} but is sharper than \\cite{Breiman1999}'s minimum margin bound. By incorporating factors such as average margin and variance, we present a generalization error bound that is heavily related to the whole margin distribution. We also provide margin distribution bounds for generalization error of voting classifiers in finite VC-dimension space."}
{"text": "  In this work, we propose a new optimization framework for multiclass boosting learning. In the literature, AdaBoost.MO and AdaBoost.ECC are the two successful multiclass boosting algorithms, which can use binary weak learners. We explicitly derive these two algorithms' Lagrange dual problems based on their regularized loss functions. We show that the Lagrange dual formulations enable us to design totally-corrective multiclass algorithms by using the primal-dual optimization technique. Experiments on benchmark data sets suggest that our multiclass boosting can achieve a comparable generalization capability with state-of-the-art, but the convergence speed is much faster than stage-wise gradient descent boosting. In other words, the new totally corrective algorithms can maximize the margin more aggressively."}
{"text": "  Finding sparse solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem in signal processing and statistics which has become a subject of interest in recent years. In general, these systems have infinitely many solutions. However, it may be shown that sufficiently sparse solutions may be identified uniquely. In other words, the corresponding linear transformation will be invertible if we restrict its domain to sufficiently sparse vectors. This property may be used, for example, to solve the underdetermined Blind Source Separation (BSS) problem, or to find sparse representation of a signal in an `overcomplete' dictionary of primitive elements (i.e., the so-called atomic decomposition). The main drawback of current methods of finding sparse solutions is their computational complexity. In this paper, we will show that by detecting `active' components of the (potential) solution, i.e., those components having a considerable value, a framework for fast solution of the problem may be devised. The idea leads to a family of algorithms, called `Iterative Detection-Estimation (IDE)', which converge to the solution by successive detection and estimation of its active part. Comparing the performance of IDE(s) with one of the most successful method to date, which is based on Linear Programming (LP), an improvement in speed of about two to three orders of magnitude is observed."}
{"text": "  We establish an excess risk bound of O(H R_n^2 + R_n \\sqrt{H L*}) for empirical risk minimization with an H-smooth loss function and a hypothesis class with Rademacher complexity R_n, where L* is the best risk achievable by the hypothesis class. For typical hypothesis classes where R_n = \\sqrt{R/n}, this translates to a learning rate of O(RH/n) in the separable (L*=0) case and O(RH/n + \\sqrt{L^* RH/n}) more generally. We also provide similar guarantees for online and stochastic convex optimization with a smooth non-negative objective."}
{"text": "  Sparse learning has recently received increasing attention in many areas including machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm regularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group sparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however, challenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization. Existing work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the L1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than 1, thus significantly extending existing work. One key building block of the proposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our theoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why EP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the special cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient algorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  An instance-weighted variant of the support vector machine (SVM) has attracted considerable attention recently since they are useful in various machine learning tasks such as non-stationary data analysis, heteroscedastic data modeling, transfer learning, learning to rank, and transduction. An important challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational bottleneck---instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus the weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM solutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this contribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path algorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight parameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that breakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in high-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric representation of instance weights. We also provide a geometric interpretation in weight space using a notion of critical region: a polyhedron in which the current affine solution remains to be optimal. Then we find breakpoints at intersections of the solution path and boundaries of polyhedrons. Through extensive experiments on various practical applications, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Modeling data with linear combinations of a few elements from a learned dictionary has been the focus of much recent research in machine learning, neuroscience and signal processing. For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult. In this paper, we present a general formulation for supervised dictionary learning adapted to a wide variety of tasks, and present an efficient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on handwritten digit classification, digital art identification, nonlinear inverse image problems, and compressed sensing demonstrate that our approach is effective in large-scale settings, and is well suited to supervised and semi-supervised classification, as well as regression tasks for data that admit sparse representations."}
{"text": "  Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes has become an increasingly popular tool in the machine learning community. It is efficient and can be used when very little is known about the objective function, making it popular in expensive black-box optimization scenarios. It uses Bayesian methods to sample the objective efficiently using an acquisition function which incorporates the model's estimate of the objective and the uncertainty at any given point. However, there are several different parameterized acquisition functions in the literature, and it is often unclear which one to use. Instead of using a single acquisition function, we adopt a portfolio of acquisition functions governed by an online multi-armed bandit strategy. We propose several portfolio strategies, the best of which we call GP-Hedge, and show that this method outperforms the best individual acquisition function. We also provide a theoretical bound on the algorithm's performance."}
{"text": "  A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Baysian computation without likelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission of delay-sensitive data (e.g. multimedia data) over a fading channel. Existing research on this topic utilizes either physical-layer centric solutions, namely power-control and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), or system-level solutions based on dynamic power management (DPM); however, there is currently no rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing both physical-layer centric and system-level techniques to achieve the minimum possible energy consumption, under delay constraints, in the presence of stochastic and a priori unknown traffic and channel conditions. In this report, we propose such a framework. We formulate the stochastic optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it online using reinforcement learning. The advantages of the proposed online method are that (i) it does not require a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics to determine the jointly optimal power-control, AMC, and DPM policies; (ii) it exploits partial information about the system so that less information needs to be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and (iii) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits the adaptation speed and run-time performance of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed learning algorithms can converge up to two orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art learning algorithm for physical layer power-control and up to three orders of magnitude faster than conventional reinforcement learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  We propose a focus of attention mechanism to speed up the Perceptron algorithm. Focus of attention speeds up the Perceptron algorithm by lowering the number of features evaluated throughout training and prediction. Whereas the traditional Perceptron evaluates all the features of each example, the Attentive Perceptron evaluates less features for easy to classify examples, thereby achieving significant speedups and small losses in prediction accuracy. Focus of attention allows the Attentive Perceptron to stop the evaluation of features at any interim point and filter the example. This creates an attentive filter which concentrates computation at examples that are hard to classify, and quickly filters examples that are easy to classify."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider a queue-aware distributive resource control algorithm for two-hop MIMO cooperative systems. We shall illustrate that relay buffering is an effective way to reduce the intrinsic half-duplex penalty in cooperative systems. The complex interactions of the queues at the source node and the relays are modeled as an average-cost infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). The traditional approach solving this MDP problem involves centralized control with huge complexity. To obtain a distributive and low complexity solution, we introduce a linear structure which approximates the value function of the associated Bellman equation by the sum of per-node value functions. We derive a distributive two-stage two-winner auction-based control policy which is a function of the local CSI and local QSI only. Furthermore, to estimate the best fit approximation parameter, we propose a distributive online stochastic learning algorithm using stochastic approximation theory. Finally, we establish technical conditions for almost-sure convergence and show that under heavy traffic, the proposed low complexity distributive control is global optimal."}
{"text": "  In nonparametric classification and regression problems, regularized kernel methods, in particular support vector machines, attract much attention in theoretical and in applied statistics. In an abstract sense, regularized kernel methods (simply called SVMs here) can be seen as regularized M-estimators for a parameter in a (typically infinite dimensional) reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For smooth loss functions, it is shown that the difference between the estimator, i.e.\\ the empirical SVM, and the theoretical SVM is asymptotically normal with rate $\\sqrt{n}$. That is, the standardized difference converges weakly to a Gaussian process in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As common in real applications, the choice of the regularization parameter may depend on the data. The proof is done by an application of the functional delta-method and by showing that the SVM-functional is suitably Hadamard-differentiable."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. This problem is relevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero components of this vector can be \"relaxed\" by regularizing the squared error with a convex penalty function like the $\\ell_1$ norm. However, in many applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In this paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\\ell_1$ norm and is flexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish the basic properties of these penalty functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso method and other related methods."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of learning a binary classifier from a training set of positive and unlabeled examples, both in the inductive and in the transductive setting. This problem, often referred to as \\emph{PU learning}, differs from the standard supervised classification problem by the lack of negative examples in the training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous situation in many applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking, when we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data sharing the same property among a large and easily available pool of unlabeled data. We propose a conceptually simple method, akin to bagging, to approach both inductive and transductive PU learning problems, by converting them into series of supervised binary classification problems discriminating the known positive examples from random subsamples of the unlabeled set. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of the method on simulated and real data, where it performs at least as well as existing methods while being faster."}
{"text": "  To classify time series by nearest neighbors, we need to specify or learn one or several distance measures. We consider variations of the Mahalanobis distance measures which rely on the inverse covariance matrix of the data. Unfortunately --- for time series data --- the covariance matrix has often low rank. To alleviate this problem we can either use a pseudoinverse, covariance shrinking or limit the matrix to its diagonal. We review these alternatives and benchmark them against competitive methods such as the related Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is superior, but the Mahalanobis distance measures are one to two orders of magnitude faster. To get best results with Mahalanobis distance measures, we recommend learning one distance measure per class using either covariance shrinking or the diagonal approach."}
{"text": "  This paper describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the beta-divergence (beta-NMF). The beta-divergence is a family of cost functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace)."}
{"text": "  Despite the recent progress towards efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL), the structured output case remains an open research front. Current approaches involve repeatedly solving a batch learning problem, which makes them inadequate for large scale scenarios. We propose a new family of online proximal algorithms for MKL (as well as for group-lasso and variants thereof), which overcomes that drawback. We show regret, convergence, and generalization bounds for the proposed method. Experiments on handwriting recognition and dependency parsing testify for the successfulness of the approach."}
{"text": "  The group lasso is a penalized regression method, used in regression problems where the covariates are partitioned into groups to promote sparsity at the group level. Existing methods for finding the group lasso estimator either use gradient projection methods to update the entire coefficient vector simultaneously at each step, or update one group of coefficients at a time using an inexact line search to approximate the optimal value for the group of coefficients when all other groups' coefficients are fixed. We present a new method of computation for the group lasso in the linear regression case, the Single Line Search (SLS) algorithm, which operates by computing the exact optimal value for each group (when all other coefficients are fixed) with one univariate line search. We perform simulations demonstrating that the SLS algorithm is often more efficient than existing computational methods. We also extend the SLS algorithm to the sparse group lasso problem via the Signed Single Line Search (SSLS) algorithm, and give theoretical results to support both algorithms."}
{"text": "  Hardness results for maximum agreement problems have close connections to hardness results for proper learning in computational learning theory. In this paper we prove two hardness results for the problem of finding a low degree polynomial threshold function (PTF) which has the maximum possible agreement with a given set of labeled examples in $\\R^n \\times \\{-1,1\\}.$ We prove that for any constants $d\\geq 1, \\eps > 0$,   {itemize}   Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, no polynomial-time algorithm can find a degree-$d$ PTF that is consistent with a $(\\half + \\eps)$ fraction of a given set of labeled examples in $\\R^n \\times \\{-1,1\\}$, even if there exists a degree-$d$ PTF that is consistent with a $1-\\eps$ fraction of the examples.   It is $\\NP$-hard to find a degree-2 PTF that is consistent with a $(\\half + \\eps)$ fraction of a given set of labeled examples in $\\R^n \\times \\{-1,1\\}$, even if there exists a halfspace (degree-1 PTF) that is consistent with a $1 - \\eps$ fraction of the examples.   {itemize}   These results immediately imply the following hardness of learning results: (i) Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, there is no better-than-trivial proper learning algorithm that agnostically learns degree-$d$ PTFs under arbitrary distributions; (ii) There is no better-than-trivial learning algorithm that outputs degree-2 PTFs and agnostically learns halfspaces (i.e. degree-1 PTFs) under arbitrary distributions."}

{"text": "  This paper considers the clustering problem for large data sets. We propose an approach based on distributed optimization. The clustering problem is formulated as an optimization problem of maximizing the classification gain. We show that the optimization problem can be reformulated and decomposed into small-scale sub optimization problems by using the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method. Generally speaking, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can only be used for convex optimization problems, where the duality gaps are zero. Even though, the considered optimization problem in this paper is non-convex, we prove that the duality gap goes to zero, as the problem size goes to infinity. Therefore, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can be applied here. In the proposed approach, the clustering problem is iteratively solved by a group of computers coordinated by one center processor, where each computer solves one independent small-scale sub optimization problem during each iteration, and only a small amount of data communication is needed between the computers and center processor. Numerical results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient."}
{"text": "  We give sublinear-time approximation algorithms for some optimization problems arising in machine learning, such as training linear classifiers and finding minimum enclosing balls. Our algorithms can be extended to some kernelized versions of these problems, such as SVDD, hard margin SVM, and L2-SVM, for which sublinear-time algorithms were not known before. These new algorithms use a combination of a novel sampling techniques and a new multiplicative update algorithm. We give lower bounds which show the running times of many of our algorithms to be nearly best possible in the unit-cost RAM model. We also give implementations of our algorithms in the semi-streaming setting, obtaining the first low pass polylogarithmic space and sublinear time algorithms achieving arbitrary approximation factor."}
{"text": "  A density ratio is defined by the ratio of two probability densities. We study the inference problem of density ratios and apply a semi-parametric density-ratio estimator to the two-sample homogeneity test. In the proposed test procedure, the f-divergence between two probability densities is estimated using a density-ratio estimator. The f-divergence estimator is then exploited for the two-sample homogeneity test. We derive the optimal estimator of f-divergence in the sense of the asymptotic variance, and then investigate the relation between the proposed test procedure and the existing score test based on empirical likelihood estimator. Through numerical studies, we illustrate the adequacy of the asymptotic theory for finite-sample inference."}
{"text": "  In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for empirical risk minimizers. In the general setting, we prove sanity-check bounds in the spirit of \\cite{KR99} \\textquotedblleft\\textit{bounds showing that the worst-case error of this estimate is not much worse that of training error estimate} \\textquotedblright . General loss functions and class of predictors with finite VC-dimension are considered. We closely follow the formalism introduced by \\cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$% -fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\\upsilon$-out cross-validation.   In particular, we focus on proving the consistency of the various cross-validation procedures. We point out the interest of each cross-validation procedure in terms of rate of convergence. An estimation curve with transition phases depending on the cross-validation procedure and not only on the percentage of observations in the test sample gives a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation. An interesting consequence is that the size of the test sample is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the cross-validation procedure."}
{"text": "  Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods (AGM) have been successfully applied in many machine learning areas. However, their empirical performance on training max-margin models has been inferior to existing specialized solvers. In this paper, we first extend AGM to strongly convex and composite objective functions with Bregman style prox-functions. Our unifying framework covers both the $\\infty$-memory and 1-memory styles of AGM, tunes the Lipschiz constant adaptively, and bounds the duality gap. Then we demonstrate various ways to apply this framework of methods to a wide range of machine learning problems. Emphasis will be given on their rate of convergence and how to efficiently compute the gradient and optimize the models. The experimental results show that with our extensions AGM outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on max-margin models."}
{"text": "  The performance of the Lasso is well understood under the assumptions of the standard linear model with homoscedastic noise. However, in several applications, the standard model does not describe the important features of the data. This paper examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model that is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation. Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are \\textit{not} independent of the design matrix.   More specifically, this paper studies the sign consistency of the Lasso under a sparse Poisson-like model. In addition to studying sufficient conditions for the sign consistency of the Lasso estimate, this paper also gives necessary conditions for sign consistency. Both sets of conditions are comparable to results for the homoscedastic model, showing that when a measure of the signal to noise ratio is large, the Lasso performs well on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data.   Simulations reveal that the Lasso performs equally well in terms of model selection performance on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data (with properly scaled noise variance), across a range of parameterizations. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the Lasso is robust to the Poisson-like heteroscedastic noise."}
{"text": "  An importance weight quantifies the relative importance of one example over another, coming up in applications of boosting, asymmetric classification costs, reductions, and active learning. The standard approach for dealing with importance weights in gradient descent is via multiplication of the gradient. We first demonstrate the problems of this approach when importance weights are large, and argue in favor of more sophisticated ways for dealing with them. We then develop an approach which enjoys an invariance property: that updating twice with importance weight $h$ is equivalent to updating once with importance weight $2h$. For many important losses this has a closed form update which satisfies standard regret guarantees when all examples have $h=1$. We also briefly discuss two other reasonable approaches for handling large importance weights. Empirically, these approaches yield substantially superior prediction with similar computational performance while reducing the sensitivity of the algorithm to the exact setting of the learning rate. We apply these to online active learning yielding an extraordinarily fast active learning algorithm that works even in the presence of adversarial noise."}
{"text": "  Often we wish to predict a large number of variables that depend on each other as well as on other observed variables. Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classification and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random fields, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields."}
{"text": "  In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for stable predictors in the context of risk assessment.

{"text": "  Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data.

{"text": "  The goal of cross-domain object matching (CDOM) is to find correspondence between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. Photo album summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system. CDOM is usually formulated as finding a mapping from objects in one domain (photos) to objects in the other domain (frame) so that the pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art CDOM method employs a kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that the kernel parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection problem. Through experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and photo album summarization tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated."}
{"text": "  We present a tutorial on Bayesian optimization, a method of finding the maximum of expensive cost functions. Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments---active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning---and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences."}
{"text": "  Translating potential disease biomarkers between multi-species 'omics' experiments is a new direction in biomedical research. The existing methods are limited to simple experimental setups such as basic healthy-diseased comparisons. Most of these methods also require an a priori matching of the variables (e.g., genes or metabolites) between the species. However, many experiments have a complicated multi-way experimental design often involving irregularly-sampled time-series measurements, and for instance metabolites do not always have known matchings between organisms. We introduce a Bayesian modelling framework for translating between multiple species the results from 'omics' experiments having a complex multi-way, time-series experimental design. The underlying assumption is that the unknown matching can be inferred from the response of the variables to multiple covariates including time."}

{"text": "  We study the problem of estimating a temporally varying coefficient and varying structure (VCVS) graphical model underlying nonstationary time series data, such as social states of interacting individuals or microarray expression profiles of gene networks, as opposed to i.i.d. data from an invariant model widely considered in current literature of structural estimation. In particular, we consider the scenario in which the model evolves in a piece-wise constant fashion. We propose a procedure that minimizes the so-called TESLA loss (i.e., temporally smoothed L1 regularized regression), which allows jointly estimating the partition boundaries of the VCVS model and the coefficient of the sparse precision matrix on each block of the partition. A highly scalable proximal gradient method is proposed to solve the resultant convex optimization problem; and the conditions for sparsistent estimation and the convergence rate of both the partition boundaries and the network structure are established for the first time for such estimators."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a two-timescale delay-optimal dynamic clustering and power allocation design for downlink network MIMO systems. The dynamic clustering control is adaptive to the global queue state information (GQSI) only and computed at the base station controller (BSC) over a longer time scale. On the other hand, the power allocations of all the BSs in one cluster are adaptive to both intra-cluster channel state information (CCSI) and intra-cluster queue state information (CQSI), and computed at the cluster manager (CM) over a shorter time scale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control can be formulated as an infinite-horizon average cost Constrained Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (CPOMDP). By exploiting the special problem structure, we shall derive an equivalent Bellman equation in terms of Pattern Selection Q-factor to solve the CPOMDP. To address the distributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory requirement and computational complexity, we approximate the Pattern Selection Q-factor by the sum of Per-cluster Potential functions and propose a novel distributive online learning algorithm to estimate the Per-cluster Potential functions (at each CM) as well as the Lagrange multipliers (LM) (at each BS). We show that the proposed distributive online learning algorithm converges almost surely (with probability 1). By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics, we further decompose the Per-cluster Potential function into sum of Per-cluster Per-user Potential functions and formulate the instantaneous power allocation as a Per-stage QSI-aware Interference Game played among all the CMs. We also propose a QSI-aware Simultaneous Iterative Water-filling Algorithm (QSIWFA) and show that it can achieve the Nash Equilibrium (NE)."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel application of the Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (S-OMP) procedure for sparsistant variable selection in ultra-high dimensional multi-task regression problems. Screening of variables, as introduced in \\cite{fan08sis}, is an efficient and highly scalable way to remove many irrelevant variables from the set of all variables, while retaining all the relevant variables. S-OMP can be applied to problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and once the number of variables is reduced to a manageable size, a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to identify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize relatedness of multiple outputs to perform fast screening of relevant variables. As our main theoretical contribution, we prove that, asymptotically, S-OMP is guaranteed to reduce an ultra-high number of variables to below the sample size without losing true relevant variables. We also provide formal evidence that a modified Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can be used to efficiently determine the number of iterations in S-OMP. We further provide empirical evidence on the benefit of variable selection using multiple regression outputs jointly, as opposed to performing variable selection for each output separately. The finite sample performance of S-OMP is demonstrated on extensive simulation studies, and on a genetic association mapping problem. $Keywords$ Adaptive Lasso; Greedy forward regression; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Multi-output regression; Multi-task learning; Simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit; Sure screening; Variable selection"}
{"text": "  To attain the best learning accuracy, people move on with difficulties and frustrations. Though one can optimize the empirical objective using a given set of samples, its generalization ability to the entire sample distribution remains questionable. Even if a fair generalization guarantee is offered, one still wants to know what is to happen if the regularizer is removed, and/or how well the artificial loss (like the hinge loss) relates to the accuracy.   For such reason, this report surveys four different trials towards the learning accuracy, embracing the major advances in supervised learning theory in the past four years. Starting from the generic setting of learning, the first two trials introduce the best optimization and generalization bounds for convex learning, and the third trial gets rid of the regularizer. As an innovative attempt, the fourth trial studies the optimization when the objective is exactly the accuracy, in the special case of binary classification. This report also analyzes the last trial through experiments."}

{"text": "  This article discusses in detail the rating system that won the kaggle competition \"Chess Ratings: Elo vs the rest of the world\". The competition provided a historical dataset of outcomes for chess games, and aimed to discover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games, more accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating system, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating system. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the outcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of the players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that avoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is relatively small and one has to be careful not to draw \"too many conclusions\" out of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs of such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a very good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the private hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the number of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the opponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for training the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage and regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation."}
{"text": "  With the present revival of interest in bistatic radar systems, research in that area has gained momentum. Given some of the strategic advantages for a bistatic configuration, and tech- nological advances in the past few years, large-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near future. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least par- tially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be manageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities of an automatic target recognition (ATR) facil- ity in a bistatic radar system is presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on simulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for the introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that, contrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be substantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR performed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the ATR per- formance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic angle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have distinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results, suggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR per- formance with changing bistatic angle. Finally, a new fast and robust ATR algorithm (developed in the present work) has been presented."}
{"text": "  In the applications related to airborne radars, simulation has always played an important role. This is mainly because of the two fold reason of the unavailability of desired data and the difficulty associated with the collection of data under controlled environment. A simple example will be regarding the collection of pure multipolar radar data. Even after phenomenal development in the field of radar hardware design and signal processing, till now the collection of pure multipolar data is a challenge for the radar system designers. Till very recently, the power of computer simulation of radar signal return was available to a very selected few. This was because of the heavy cost associated with some of the main line electro magnetic (EM) simulators for radar signal simulation, and secondly because many such EM simulators are for restricted marketting. However, because of the fast progress made in the field of EM simulation, many of the current generic EM simulators can be used to simulate radar returns from realistic targets. The current article expounds the steps towards generating a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image database of ground targets, using a eneric EM g simulator. It also demonstrates by the help of some example images, the quality of the SAR mage generated i using a general purpose EM simulator."}
{"text": "  We propose in this work a new family of kernels for variable-length time series. Our work builds upon the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for multivariate stochastic processes: given a multivariate time series x, we consider the likelihood function p_{\\theta}(x) of different parameters \\theta in the VAR model as features to describe x. To compare two time series x and x', we form the product of their features p_{\\theta}(x) p_{\\theta}(x') which is integrated out w.r.t \\theta using a matrix normal-inverse Wishart prior. Among other properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of the time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x and x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary state spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel \\kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram matrices produced by \\kappa on observations and subsequences of observations enumerated in x and x'. We describe a computationally efficient implementation of this generalization that uses low-rank matrix factorization techniques. These kernels are compared to other known kernels using a set of benchmark classification tasks carried out with support vector machines."}
{"text": "  Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to analyze causal relations between continuous variables. In such frameworks, linear acyclic models are typically used to model the data-generating process of variables. Recently, it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identifies the full structure of a linear acyclic model, i.e., a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths, without using any prior knowledge on the network structure, which is not the case with conventional methods. However, existing estimation methods are based on iterative search algorithms and may not converge to a correct solution in a finite number of steps. In this paper, we propose a new direct method to estimate a causal ordering and connection strengths based on non-Gaussianity.   In contrast to the previous methods, our algorithm requires no algorithmic parameters and is guaranteed to converge to the right solution within a small fixed number of steps if the data strictly follows the model."}
{"text": "  An important part of problems in statistical physics and computer science can be expressed as the computation of marginal probabilities over a Markov Random Field. The belief propagation algorithm, which is an exact procedure to compute these marginals when the underlying graph is a tree, has gained its popularity as an efficient way to approximate them in the more general case. In this paper, we focus on an aspect of the algorithm that did not get that much attention in the literature, which is the effect of the normalization of the messages. We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization strategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence. Following this, we express the necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability of a fixed point in terms of the graph structure and the beliefs values at the fixed point. We also explicit some connexion between the normalization constants and the underlying Bethe Free Energy."}
{"text": "  We consider a retailer selling a single product with limited on-hand inventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives according to a Poisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by the retailer (such as price adjustment, sales commission, advertisement intensity, etc.). The relationship between the action and the demand rate is not known in advance. However, the retailer is able to learn the optimal action \"on the fly\" as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on the observed demand reactions.   Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic \"learning-while-doing\" algorithm that only involves function value estimation to achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs a series of shrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices within that interval using a set of carefully chosen parameters. We prove that the convergence rate of our algorithm is among the fastest of all possible algorithms in terms of asymptotic \"regret\" (the relative loss comparing to the full information optimal solution). Our result closes the performance gaps between parametric and non-parametric learning and between a post-price mechanism and a customer-bidding mechanism. Important managerial insight from this research is that the values of information on both the parametric form of the demand function as well as each customer's exact reservation price are less important than prior literature suggests. Our results also suggest that firms would be better off to perform dynamic learning and action concurrently rather than sequentially."}
{"text": "  This article presents a model which is capable of learning and abstracting new concepts based on comparing observations and finding the resemblance between the observations. In the model, the new observations are compared with the templates which have been derived from the previous experiences. In the first stage, the objects are first represented through a geometric description which is used for finding the object boundaries and a descriptor which is inspired by the human visual system and then they are fed into the model. Next, the new observations are identified through comparing them with the previously-learned templates and are used for producing new templates. The comparisons are made based on measures like Euclidean or correlation distance. The new template is created by applying onion-pealing algorithm. The algorithm consecutively uses convex hulls which are made by the points representing the objects. If the new observation is remarkably similar to one of the observed categories, it is no longer utilized in creating a new template. The existing templates are used to provide a description of the new observation. This description is provided in the templates space. Each template represents a dimension of the feature space. The degree of the resemblance each template bears to each object indicates the value associated with the object in that dimension of the templates space. In this way, the description of the new observation becomes more accurate and detailed as the time passes and the experiences increase. We have used this model for learning and recognizing the new polygons in the polygon space. Representing the polygons was made possible through employing a geometric method and a method inspired by human visual system. Various implementations of the model have been compared. The evaluation results of the model prove its efficiency in learning and deriving new templates."}
{"text": "  Existing approaches to analyzing the asymptotics of graph Laplacians typically assume a well-behaved kernel function with smoothness assumptions. We remove the smoothness assumption and generalize the analysis of graph Laplacians to include previously unstudied graphs including kNN graphs. We also introduce a kernel-free framework to analyze graph constructions with shrinking neighborhoods in general and apply it to analyze locally linear embedding (LLE). We also describe how for a given limiting Laplacian operator desirable properties such as a convergent spectrum and sparseness can be achieved choosing the appropriate graph construction."}
{"text": "  It is a challenging task to select correlated variables in a high dimensional space. To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and successfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the elastic net does not explicitly use correlation information embedded in data to select correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel Bayesian hybrid model, the EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to guide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional classification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in a principled Bayesian framework. We reparameterize the hybrid model in the eigenspace to avoid overfiting and to increase the computational efficiency of its MCMC sampler. Furthermore, we provide an alternative view to the EigenNet from a regularization perspective: the EigenNet has an adaptive eigenspace-based composite regularizer, which naturally generalizes the $l_{1/2}$ regularizer used by the elastic net. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that the EigenNet significantly outperforms the lasso, the elastic net, and the Bayesian lasso in terms of prediction accuracy, especially when the number of training samples is smaller than the number of variables."}
{"text": "  A collaborative convex framework for factoring a data matrix $X$ into a non-negative product $AS$, with a sparse coefficient matrix $S$, is proposed. We restrict the columns of the dictionary matrix $A$ to coincide with certain columns of the data matrix $X$, thereby guaranteeing a physically meaningful dictionary and dimensionality reduction. We use $l_{1,\\infty}$ regularization to select the dictionary from the data and show this leads to an exact convex relaxation of $l_0$ in the case of distinct noise free data. We also show how to relax the restriction-to-$X$ constraint by initializing an alternating minimization approach with the solution of the convex model, obtaining a dictionary close to but not necessarily in $X$. We focus on applications of the proposed framework to hyperspectral endmember and abundances identification and also show an application to blind source separation of NMR data."}
{"text": "  This paper treats the problem of screening for variables with high correlations in high dimensional data in which there can be many fewer samples than variables. We focus on threshold-based correlation screening methods for three related applications: screening for variables with large correlations within a single treatment (autocorrelation screening); screening for variables with large cross-correlations over two treatments (cross-correlation screening); screening for variables that have persistently large auto-correlations over two treatments (persistent-correlation screening). The novelty of correlation screening is that it identifies a smaller number of variables which are highly correlated with others, as compared to identifying a number of correlation parameters. Correlation screening suffers from a phase transition phenomenon: as the correlation threshold decreases the number of discoveries increases abruptly. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the mean number of discoveries and the phase transition thresholds as a function of the number of samples, the number of variables, and the joint sample distribution. We also show that under a weak dependency condition the number of discoveries is dominated by a Poisson random variable giving an asymptotic expression for the false positive rate. The correlation screening approach bears tremendous dividends in terms of the type and strength of the asymptotic results that can be obtained. It also overcomes some of the major hurdles faced by existing methods in the literature as correlation screening is naturally scalable to high dimension. Numerical results strongly validate the theory that is presented in this paper. We illustrate the application of the correlation screening methodology on a large scale gene-expression dataset, revealing a few influential variables that exhibit a significant amount of correlation over multiple treatments."}
{"text": "  Unsupervised discovery of latent representations, in addition to being useful for density modeling, visualisation and exploratory data analysis, is also increasingly important for learning features relevant to discriminative tasks. Autoencoders, in particular, have proven to be an effective way to learn latent codes that reflect meaningful variations in data. A continuing challenge, however, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for particular tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are invariant to irrelevant transformations of the data. The most common way of introducing such problem-specific guidance in autoencoders has been through the incorporation of a parametric component that ties the latent representation to the label information. In this work, we argue that a preferable approach relies instead on a nonparametric guidance mechanism. Conceptually, it ensures that there exists a function that can predict the label information, without explicitly instantiating that function. The superiority of this guidance mechanism is confirmed on two datasets. In particular, this approach is able to incorporate invariance information (lighting, elevation, etc.) from the small NORB object recognition dataset and yields state-of-the-art performance for a single layer, non-convolutional network."}
{"text": "  Ordinal regression is commonly formulated as a multi-class problem with ordinal constraints. The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed. The availability of ordinal class labels, however, is often costly to calibrate or difficult to obtain. Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater abundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of unlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression in this paper, namely Transductive Ordinal Regression (TOR). The key challenge of the present study lies in the precise estimation of both the ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the ordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include an objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions casted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label swapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective function value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used benchmark datasets including the real world sentiment prediction problem are then presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed transductive ordinal regression. Further, comparisons to recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods demonstrate the introduced transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression led to the robust and improved performance."}
{"text": "  We propose an active set selection framework for Gaussian process classification for cases when the dataset is large enough to render its inference prohibitive. Our scheme consists of a two step alternating procedure of active set update rules and hyperparameter optimization based upon marginal likelihood maximization. The active set update rules rely on the ability of the predictive distributions of a Gaussian process classifier to estimate the relative contribution of a datapoint when being either included or removed from the model. This means that we can use it to include points with potentially high impact to the classifier decision process while removing those that are less relevant. We introduce two active set rules based on different criteria, the first one prefers a model with interpretable active set parameters whereas the second puts computational complexity first, thus a model with active set parameters that directly control its complexity. We also provide both theoretical and empirical support for our active set selection strategy being a good approximation of a full Gaussian process classifier. Our extensive experiments show that our approach can compete with state-of-the-art classification techniques with reasonable time complexity.

{"text": "  We investigate the learning rate of multiple kernel leaning (MKL) with elastic-net regularization, which consists of an $\\ell_1$-regularizer for inducing the sparsity and an $\\ell_2$-regularizer for controlling the smoothness.

Our bound is sharper than the convergence rates ever shown, and has a property that the smoother the truth is, the faster the convergence rate is."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of learning an unknown product distribution $X$ over $\\{0,1\\}^n$ using samples $f(X)$ where $f$ is a \\emph{known} transformation function. Each choice of a transformation function $f$ specifies a learning problem in this framework.   Information-theoretic arguments show that for every transformation function $f$ the corresponding learning problem can be solved to accuracy $\\eps$, using $\\tilde{O}(n/\\eps^2)$ examples, by a generic algorithm whose running time may be exponential in $n.$ We show that this learning problem can be computationally intractable even for constant $\\eps$ and rather simple transformation functions. Moreover, the above sample complexity bound is nearly optimal for the general problem, as we give a simple explicit linear transformation function $f(x)=w \\cdot x$ with integer weights $w_i \\leq n$ and prove that the corresponding learning problem requires $\\Omega(n)$ samples.   As our main positive result we give a highly efficient algorithm for learning a sum of independent unknown Bernoulli random variables, corresponding to the transformation function $f(x)= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. Our algorithm learns to $\\eps$-accuracy in poly$(n)$ time, using a surprising poly$(1/\\eps)$ number of samples that is independent of $n.$ We also give an efficient algorithm that uses $\\log n \\cdot \\poly(1/\\eps)$ samples but has running time that is only $\\poly(\\log n, 1/\\eps).$"}

Furthermore, we derive an efficient and provably convergent optimisation algorithm."}
{"text": "  Feature selection with specific multivariate performance measures is the key to the success of many applications, such as image retrieval and text classification. The existing feature selection methods are usually designed for classification error. In this paper, we propose a generalized sparse regularizer. Based on the proposed regularizer, we present a unified feature selection framework for general loss functions. In particular, we study the novel feature selection paradigm by optimizing multivariate performance measures. The resultant formulation is a challenging problem for high-dimensional data. Hence, a two-layer cutting plane algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, and the convergence is presented. In addition, we adapt the proposed method to optimize multivariate measures for multiple instance learning problems. The analyses by comparing with the state-of-the-art feature selection methods show that the proposed method is superior to others. Extensive experiments on large-scale and high-dimensional real world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms $l_1$-SVM and SVM-RFE when choosing a small subset of features, and achieves significantly improved performances over SVM$^{perf}$ in terms of $F_1$-score."}
{"text": "  Gaussian Process (GP) models are often used as mathematical approximations of computationally expensive experiments. Provided that its kernel is suitably chosen and that enough data is available to obtain a reasonable fit of the simulator, a GP model can beneficially be used for tasks such as prediction, optimization, or Monte-Carlo-based quantification of uncertainty. However, the former conditions become unrealistic when using classical GPs as the dimension of input increases. One popular alternative is then to turn to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), relying on the assumption that the simulator's response can approximately be decomposed as a sum of univariate functions. If such an approach has been successfully applied in approximation, it is nevertheless not completely compatible with the GP framework and its versatile applications. The ambition of the present work is to give an insight into the use of GPs for additive models by integrating additivity within the kernel, and proposing a parsimonious numerical method for data-driven parameter estimation. The first part of this article deals with the kernels naturally associated to additive processes and the properties of the GP models based on such kernels. The second part is dedicated to a numerical procedure based on relaxation for additive kernel parameter estimation. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated and compared to other approaches on Sobol's g-function."}
{"text": "  In this work we study parallelization of online learning, a core primitive in machine learning. In a parallel environment all known approaches for parallel online learning lead to delayed updates, where the model is updated using out-of-date information. In the worst case, or when examples are temporally correlated, delay can have a very adverse effect on the learning algorithm. Here, we analyze and present preliminary empirical results on a set of learning architectures based on a feature sharding approach that present various tradeoffs between delay, degree of parallelism, representation power and empirical performance."}
{"text": "  We present two sets of theoretical results on the grouped lasso with overlap of Jacob, Obozinski and Vert (2009) in the linear regression setting. This method allows for joint selection of predictors in sparse regression, allowing for complex structured sparsity over the predictors encoded as a set of groups. This flexible framework suggests that arbitrarily complex structures can be encoded with an intricate set of groups. Our results show that this strategy results in unexpected theoretical consequences for the procedure. In particular, we give two sets of results: (1) finite sample bounds on prediction and estimation, and (2) asymptotic distribution and selection. Both sets of results give insight into the consequences of choosing an increasingly complex set of groups for the procedure, as well as what happens when the set of groups cannot recover the true sparsity pattern. Additionally, these results demonstrate the differences and similarities between the the grouped lasso procedure with and without overlapping groups. Our analysis shows the set of groups must be chosen with caution - an overly complex set of groups will damage the analysis."}
{"text": "  We present the discrete infinite logistic normal distribution (DILN), a Bayesian nonparametric prior for mixed membership models. DILN is a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that models correlation structure between the weights of the atoms at the group level. We derive a representation of DILN as a normalized collection of gamma-distributed random variables, and study its statistical properties. We consider applications to topic modeling and derive a variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference. We study the empirical performance of the DILN topic model on four corpora, comparing performance with the HDP and the correlated topic model (CTM). To deal with large-scale data sets, we also develop an online inference algorithm for DILN and compare with online HDP and online LDA on the Nature magazine, which contains approximately 350,000 articles."}
{"text": "  The purpose of sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is to find the low-dimensional subspace of input features that is sufficient for predicting output values. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-free SDR method called sufficient component analysis (SCA), which is computationally more efficient than existing methods. In our method, a solution is computed by iteratively performing dependence estimation and maximization: Dependence estimation is analytically carried out by recently-proposed least-squares mutual information (LSMI), and dependence maximization is also analytically carried out by utilizing the Epanechnikov kernel. Through large-scale experiments on real-world image classification and audio tagging problems, the proposed method is shown to compare favorably with existing dimension reduction approaches."}
{"text": "  We theoretically investigate the convergence rate and support consistency (i.e., correctly identifying the subset of non-zero coefficients in the large sample limit) of multiple kernel learning (MKL). We focus on MKL with block-l1 regularization (inducing sparse kernel combination), block-l2 regularization (inducing uniform kernel combination), and elastic-net regularization (including both block-l1 and block-l2 regularization). For the case where the true kernel combination is sparse, we show a sharper convergence rate of the block-l1 and elastic-net MKL methods than the existing rate for block-l1 MKL. We further show that elastic-net MKL requires a milder condition for being consistent than block-l1 MKL. For the case where the optimal kernel combination is not exactly sparse, we prove that elastic-net MKL can achieve a faster convergence rate than the block-l1 and block-l2 MKL methods by carefully controlling the balance between the block-l1and block-l2 regularizers. Thus, our theoretical results overall suggest the use of elastic-net regularization in MKL."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we give a new sharp generalization bound of lp-MKL which is a generalized framework of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and imposes lp-mixed-norm regularization instead of l1-mixed-norm regularization. We utilize localization techniques to obtain the sharp learning rate. The bound is characterized by the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the associated kernels. A larger decay rate gives a faster convergence rate. Furthermore, we give the minimax learning rate on the ball characterized by lp-mixed-norm in the product space. Then we show that our derived learning rate of lp-MKL achieves the minimax optimal rate on the lp-mixed-norm ball."}
{"text": "  The discovery of non-linear causal relationship under additive non-Gaussian noise models has attracted considerable attention recently because of their high flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference algorithm called least-squares independence regression (LSIR). LSIR learns the additive noise model through the minimization of an estimator of the squared-loss mutual information between inputs and residuals. A notable advantage of LSIR over existing approaches is that tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be naturally optimized by cross-validation, allowing us to avoid overfitting in a data-dependent fashion. Through experiments with real-world datasets, we show that LSIR compares favorably with a state-of-the-art causal inference method."}
{"text": "  In this paper, auto-associative models are proposed as candidates to the generalization of Principal Component Analysis. We show that these models are dedicated to the approximation of the dataset by a manifold. Here, the word \"manifold\" refers to the topology properties of the structure. The approximating manifold is built by a projection pursuit algorithm. At each step of the algorithm, the dimension of the manifold is incremented. Some theoretical properties are provided. In particular, we can show that, at each step of the algorithm, the mean residuals norm is not increased. Moreover, it is also established that the algorithm converges in a finite number of steps. Some particular auto-associative models are exhibited and compared to the classical PCA and some neural networks models. Implementation aspects are discussed. We show that, in numerous cases, no optimization procedure is required. Some illustrations on simulated and real data are presented."}
{"text": "  Supervised learning is all about the ability to generalize knowledge. Specifically, the goal of the learning is to train a classifier using training data, in such a way that it will be capable of classifying new unseen data correctly. In order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design the learner, so it will not overfit the training data. The later can is done usually by adding a regularization term. The statistical learning theory explains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the complexity of the learned model. This explanation, however, is rather abstract and does not have a geometric intuition. The generalization error of a classifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations of the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize well. Indeed, Xu et al. [2009] have shown that the SVM formulation is equivalent to a robust optimization (RO) formulation, in which an adversary displaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined radius. In this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing each data point with a Gaussian cloud centered at the sample. Loss is evaluated as the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. This setup fits the fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. We develop an RO framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the noise. In our algorithm named GURU, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on the noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative considerations. Our experiments show that this framework performs as well as SVM and even slightly better in some cases. Generalizations for Mercer kernels and for the multiclass case are presented as well. We also show that our framework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective functions."}
{"text": "  Nonparametric methods are widely applicable to statistical inference problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric regression against outliers - that is, data markedly deviating from the postulated models. A variational counterpart to least-trimmed squares regression is shown closely related to an L0-(pseudo)norm-regularized estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type estimator equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier vector along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced bias and enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of an improved estimator obtained after replacing the L0-(pseudo)norm with a nonconvex surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is adopted to cleanse load curve data, a key task aiding operational decisions in the envisioned smart grid system. Computer simulations and tests on real load curve data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel sparsity-controlling robust estimators."}
{"text": "  We propose a new clustering technique that can be regarded as a numerical method to compute the proximity gestalt. The method analyzes edge length statistics in the MST of the dataset and provides an a contrario cluster detection criterion. The approach is fully parametric on the chosen distance and can detect arbitrarily shaped clusters. The method is also automatic, in the sense that only a single parameter is left to the user. This parameter has an intuitive interpretation as it controls the expected number of false detections. We show that the iterative application of our method can (1) provide robustness to noise and (2) solve a masking phenomenon in which a highly populated and salient cluster dominates the scene and inhibits the detection of less-populated, but still salient, clusters."}

In addition, we present several new models and inference routines, which are naturally derived within this unified viewpoint."}
{"text": "  A fundamental result of statistical learnig theory states that a concept class is PAC learnable if and only if it is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class if and only if the VC dimension of the class is finite. However, the theorem is only valid under special assumptions of measurability of the class, in which case the PAC learnability even becomes consistent. Otherwise, there is a classical example, constructed under the Continuum Hypothesis by Dudley and Durst and further adapted by Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, and Warmuth, of a concept class of VC dimension one which is neither uniform Glivenko-Cantelli nor consistently PAC learnable. We show that, rather surprisingly, under an additional set-theoretic hypothesis which is much milder than the Continuum Hypothesis (Martin's Axiom), PAC learnability is equivalent to finite VC dimension for every concept class."}
{"text": "  Q-learning is a reliable but inefficient off-policy temporal-difference method, backing up reward only one step at a time. Replacing traces, using a recency heuristic, are more efficient but less reliable. In this work, we introduce model-free, off-policy temporal difference methods that make better use of experience than Watkins' Q(\\lambda). We introduce both Optimistic Q(\\lambda) and the temporal second difference trace (TSDT). TSDT is particularly powerful in deterministic domains. TSDT uses neither recency nor frequency heuristics, storing (s,a,r,s',\\delta) so that off-policy updates can be performed after apparently suboptimal actions have been taken. There are additional advantages when using state abstraction, as in MAXQ. We demonstrate that TSDT does significantly better than both Q-learning and Watkins' Q(\\lambda) in a deterministic cliff-walking domain. Results in a noisy cliff-walking domain are less advantageous for TSDT, but demonstrate the efficacy of Optimistic Q(\\lambda), a replacing trace with some of the advantages of TSDT."}
{"text": "  In experimenting with off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) systems, we have observed unwanted on-policy learning under reproducible conditions. Here we present modifications to several TD methods that prevent unintentional on-policy learning from occurring. These modifications create a tension between exploration and learning. Traditional TD methods require commitment to finishing subtasks without exploration in order to update Q-values for early actions with high probability. One-step intra-option learning and temporal second difference traces (TSDT) do not suffer from this limitation. We demonstrate that our HRL system is efficient without commitment to completion of subtasks in a cliff-walking domain, contrary to a widespread claim in the literature that it is critical for efficiency of learning. Furthermore, decreasing commitment as exploration progresses is shown to improve both online performance and the resultant policy in the taxicab domain, opening a new avenue for research into when it is more beneficial to continue with the current subtask or to replan."}
{"text": "  In this paper we present methods for attacking and defending $k$-gram statistical analysis techniques that are used, for example, in network traffic analysis and covert channel detection. The main new result is our demonstration of how to use a behavior's or process' $k$-order statistics to build a stochastic process that has those same $k$-order stationary statistics but possesses different, deliberately designed, $(k+1)$-order statistics if desired. Such a model realizes a \"complexification\" of the process or behavior which a defender can use to monitor whether an attacker is shaping the behavior. By deliberately introducing designed $(k+1)$-order behaviors, the defender can check to see if those behaviors are present in the data. We also develop constructs for source codes that respect the $k$-order statistics of a process while encoding covert information. One fundamental consequence of these results is that certain types of behavior analyses techniques come down to an {\\em arms race} in the sense that the advantage goes to the party that has more computing resources applied to the problem."}
{"text": "  A linear non-Gaussian structural equation model called LiNGAM is an identifiable model for exploratory causal analysis. Previous methods estimate a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths based on a single dataset. However, in many application domains, data are obtained under different conditions, that is, multiple datasets are obtained rather than a single dataset. In this paper, we present a new method to jointly estimate multiple LiNGAMs under the assumption that the models share a causal ordering but may have different connection strengths and differently distributed variables. In simulations, the new method estimates the models more accurately than estimating them separately."}
{"text": "  Inverse inference, or \"brain reading\", is a recent paradigm for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, based on pattern recognition and statistical learning. By predicting some cognitive variables related to brain activation maps, this approach aims at decoding brain activity. Inverse inference takes into account the multivariate information between voxels and is currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitive information is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However, it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since there are far more features than samples, i.e., more voxels than fMRI volumes. To address this problem, different methods have been proposed, such as, among others, univariate feature selection, feature agglomeration and regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider a sparse hierarchical structured regularization. Specifically, the penalization we use is constructed from a tree that is obtained by spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering. This approach encodes the spatial structure of the data at different scales into the regularization, which makes the overall prediction procedure more robust to inter-subject variability. The regularization used induces the selection of spatially coherent predictive brain regions simultaneously at different scales. We test our algorithm on real data acquired to study the mental representation of objects, and we show that the proposed algorithm not only delineates meaningful brain regions but yields as well better prediction accuracy than reference methods."}
{"text": "  We consider a suboptimal solution path algorithm for the Support Vector Machine. The solution path algorithm is an effective tool for solving a sequence of a parametrized optimization problems in machine learning. The path of the solutions provided by this algorithm are very accurate and they satisfy the optimality conditions more strictly than other SVM optimization algorithms. In many machine learning application, however, this strict optimality is often unnecessary, and it adversely affects the computational efficiency. Our algorithm can generate the path of suboptimal solutions within an arbitrary user-specified tolerance level. It allows us to control the trade-off between the accuracy of the solution and the computational cost. Moreover, We also show that our suboptimal solutions can be interpreted as the solution of a \\emph{perturbed optimization problem} from the original one. We provide some theoretical analyses of our algorithm based on this novel interpretation. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm."}
{"text": "  We study the prevalent problem when a test distribution differs from the training distribution. We consider a setting where our training set consists of a small number of sample domains, but where we have many samples in each domain. Our goal is to generalize to a new domain. For example, we may want to learn a similarity function using only certain classes of objects, but we desire that this similarity function be applicable to object classes not present in our training sample (e.g. we might seek to learn that \"dogs are similar to dogs\" even though images of dogs were absent from our training set). Our theoretical analysis shows that we can select many more features than domains while avoiding overfitting by utilizing data-dependent variance properties. We present a greedy feature selection algorithm based on using T-statistics. Our experiments validate this theory showing that our T-statistic based greedy feature selection is more robust at avoiding overfitting than the classical greedy procedure."}
{"text": "  We compare the risk of ridge regression to a simple variant of ordinary least squares, in which one simply projects the data onto a finite dimensional subspace (as specified by a Principal Component Analysis) and then performs an ordinary (un-regularized) least squares regression in this subspace. This note shows that the risk of this ordinary least squares method is within a constant factor (namely 4) of the risk of ridge regression."}
{"text": "  We introduce an algorithm that, given n objects, learns a similarity matrix over all n^2 pairs, from crowdsourced data alone. The algorithm samples responses to adaptively chosen triplet-based relative-similarity queries. Each query has the form \"is object 'a' more similar to 'b' or to 'c'?\" and is chosen to be maximally informative given the preceding responses. The output is an embedding of the objects into Euclidean space (like MDS); we refer to this as the \"crowd kernel.\" SVMs reveal that the crowd kernel captures prominent and subtle features across a number of domains, such as \"is striped\" among neckties and \"vowel vs. consonant\" among letters."}
{"text": "  We define and discuss the first sparse coding algorithm based on closed-form EM updates and continuous latent variables. The underlying generative model consists of a standard `spike-and-slab' prior and a Gaussian noise model. Closed-form solutions for E- and M-step equations are derived by generalizing probabilistic PCA. The resulting EM algorithm can take all modes of a potentially multi-modal posterior into account. The computational cost of the algorithm scales exponentially with the number of hidden dimensions. However, with current computational resources, it is still possible to efficiently learn model parameters for medium-scale problems. Thus the model can be applied to the typical range of source separation tasks. In numerical experiments on artificial data we verify likelihood maximization and show that the derived algorithm recovers the sparse directions of standard sparse coding distributions. On source separation benchmarks comprised of realistic data we show that the algorithm is competitive with other recent methods."}
{"text": "  In this short note we prove a maximal concentration lemma for sub-Gaussian random variables stating that for independent sub-Gaussian random variables we have \\[P<(\\max_{1\\le i\\le N}S_{i}>\\epsilon>) \\le\\exp<(-\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{2\\sigma_{i}^{2}}>), \\] where $S_i$ is the sum of $i$ zero mean independent sub-Gaussian random variables and $\\sigma_i$ is the variance of the $i$th random variable."}
{"text": "  In data sets with many more features than observations, independent screening based on all univariate regression models leads to a computationally convenient variable selection method. Recent efforts have shown that in the case of generalized linear models, independent screening may suffice to capture all relevant features with high probability, even in ultra-high dimension. It is unclear whether this formal sure screening property is attainable when the response is a right-censored survival time. We propose a computationally very efficient independent screening method for survival data which can be viewed as the natural survival equivalent of correlation screening. We state conditions under which the method admits the sure screening property within a general class of single-index hazard rate models with ultra-high dimensional features. An iterative variant is also described which combines screening with penalized regression in order to handle more complex feature covariance structures. The methods are evaluated through simulation studies and through application to a real gene expression dataset."}
{"text": "  We provide a natural learning process in which a financial trader without a risk receives a gain in case when Stock Market is inefficient. In this process, the trader rationally choose his gambles using a prediction made by a randomized calibrated algorithm.

{"text": "  We begin this report by describing the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model for learning a concept class, consisting of subsets of a domain, and a function class, consisting of functions from the domain to the unit interval. Two combinatorial parameters, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and its generalization, the Fat Shattering dimension of scale e, are explained and a few examples of their calculations are given with proofs. We then explain Sauer's Lemma, which involves the VC dimension and is used to prove the equivalence of a concept class being distribution-free PAC learnable and it having finite VC dimension.   As the main new result of our research, we explore the construction of a new function class, obtained by forming compositions with a continuous logic connective, a uniformly continuous function from the unit hypercube to the unit interval, from a collection of function classes. Vidyasagar had proved that such a composition function class has finite Fat Shattering dimension of all scales if the classes in the original collection do; however, no estimates of the dimension were known. Using results by Mendelson-Vershynin and Talagrand, we bound the Fat Shattering dimension of scale e of this new function class in terms of the Fat Shattering dimensions of the collection's classes.   We conclude this report by providing a few open questions and future research topics involving the PAC learning model."}
{"text": "  In batch learning, stability together with existence and uniqueness of the solution corresponds to well-posedness of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) methods; recently, it was proved that CV_loo stability is necessary and sufficient for generalization and consistency of ERM. In this note, we introduce CV_on stability, which plays a similar note in online learning. We show that stochastic gradient descent (SDG) with the usual hypotheses is CVon stable and we then discuss the implications of CV_on stability for convergence of SGD."}
{"text": "  We address the online linear optimization problem when the actions of the forecaster are represented by binary vectors. Our goal is to understand the magnitude of the minimax regret for the worst possible set of actions. We study the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial information models of the so-called \"semi-bandit\", and \"bandit\" problems. We consider both $L_\\infty$-, and $L_2$-type of restrictions for the losses assigned by the adversary.   We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied in the series of papers Gyorgy et al. (2007), Dani et al. (2008), Abernethy et al. (2008), Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2009), Helmbold and Warmuth (2009), Koolen et al. (2010), Uchiya et al. (2010), Kale et al. (2010) and Audibert and Bubeck (2010). We provide simple proofs that recover most of the previous results. We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the bandit game, the upper and lower bounds are tight, up to a constant factor. Finally, we answer a question asked by Koolen et al. (2010) by showing that the exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against $L_{\\infty}$ adversaries."}
{"text": "  Music prediction tasks range from predicting tags given a song or clip of audio, predicting the name of the artist, or predicting related songs given a song, clip, artist name or tag. That is, we are interested in every semantic relationship between the different musical concepts in our database. In realistically sized databases, the number of songs is measured in the hundreds of thousands or more, and the number of artists in the tens of thousands or more, providing a considerable challenge to standard machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose a method that scales to such datasets which attempts to capture the semantic similarities between the database items by modeling audio, artist names, and tags in a single low-dimensional semantic space. This choice of space is learnt by optimizing the set of prediction tasks of interest jointly using multi-task learning. Our method both outperforms baseline methods and, in comparison to them, is faster and consumes less memory. We then demonstrate how our method learns an interpretable model, where the semantic space captures well the similarities of interest."}
{"text": "  We propose a nonparametric generalization of belief propagation, Kernel Belief Propagation (KBP), for pairwise Markov random fields. Messages are represented as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and message updates are simple linear operations in the RKHS. KBP makes none of the assumptions commonly required in classical BP algorithms: the variables need not arise from a finite domain or a Gaussian distribution, nor must their relations take any particular parametric form. Rather, the relations between variables are represented implicitly, and are learned nonparametrically from training data. KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where kernels are defined (Rd, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric models are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not exist. The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial in the training data size. We also propose a constant time approximate message update procedure by representing messages using a small number of basis functions. In experiments, we apply KBP to image denoising, depth prediction from still images, and protein configuration prediction: KBP is faster than competing classical and nonparametric approaches (by orders of magnitude, in some cases), while providing significantly more accurate results."}
{"text": "  In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a criterion for PAC learnability of a concept class $\\mathscr C$ under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the domain $\\Omega$. The uniform Glivenko--Cantelli property with respect to non-atomic measures is no longer a necessary condition, and consistent learnability cannot in general be expected. Our criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter $\\VC({\\mathscr C}\\,{\\mathrm{mod}}\\,\\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by \"thickening up\" single points in the definition of VC dimension to uncountable \"clusters\". Equivalently, $\\VC(\\mathscr C\\modd\\omega_1)\\leq d$ if and only if every countable subclass of $\\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\\leq d$ outside a countable subset of $\\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed as the classical VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset of a compactification of $\\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions on $\\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA). Similar results are obtained for function learning in terms of fat-shattering dimension modulo countable sets, but, just like in the classical distribution-free case, the finiteness of this parameter is sufficient but not necessary for PAC learnability under non-atomic measures."}
{"text": "  The classical perceptron rule provides a varying upper bound on the maximum margin, namely the length of the current weight vector divided by the total number of updates up to that time. Requiring that the perceptron updates its internal state whenever the normalized margin of a pattern is found not to exceed a certain fraction of this dynamic upper bound we construct a new approximate maximum margin classifier called the perceptron with dynamic margin (PDM). We demonstrate that PDM converges in a finite number of steps and derive an upper bound on them. We also compare experimentally PDM with other perceptron-like algorithms and support vector machines on hard margin tasks involving linear kernels which are equivalent to 2-norm soft margin."}
{"text": "  We propose a restricted collapsed draw (RCD) sampler, a general Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler of simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Chinese restaurant process (HCRP) with restriction. Models that require simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Dirichlet process with restriction, such as infinite Hidden markov models (iHMM), were difficult to enjoy benefits of \\markerg{the} HCRP due to combinatorial explosion in calculating distributions of coupled draws. By constructing a proposal of seating arrangements (partitioning) and stochastically accepts the proposal by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the RCD sampler makes accurate sampling for complex combination of draws while retaining efficiency of HCRP representation. Based on the RCD sampler, we developed a series of sophisticated sampling algorithms for iHMMs, including blocked Gibbs sampling, beam sampling, and split-merge sampling, that outperformed conventional iHMM samplers in experiments"}
{"text": "  A number of recent work studied the effectiveness of feature selection using Lasso. It is known that under the restricted isometry properties (RIP), Lasso does not generally lead to the exact recovery of the set of nonzero coefficients, due to the looseness of convex relaxation. This paper considers the feature selection property of nonconvex regularization, where the solution is given by a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure recovers the set of nonzero coefficients without suffering from the bias of Lasso relaxation, which complements parameter estimation results of this procedure."}
{"text": "  This paper addresses the problem of inferring sparse causal networks modeled by multivariate auto-regressive (MAR) processes. Conditions are derived under which the Group Lasso (gLasso) procedure consistently estimates sparse network structure. The key condition involves a \"false connection score.\" In particular, we show that consistent recovery is possible even when the number of observations of the network is far less than the number of parameters describing the network, provided that the false connection score is less than one. The false connection score is also demonstrated to be a useful metric of recovery in non-asymptotic regimes. The conditions suggest a modified gLasso procedure which tends to improve the false connection score and reduce the chances of reversing the direction of causal influence. Computational experiments and a real network based electrocorticogram (ECoG) simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."}
{"text": "  Given a set $F$ of $n$ positive functions over a ground set $X$, we consider the problem of computing $x^*$ that minimizes the expression $\\sum_{f\\in F}f(x)$, over $x\\in X$. A typical application is \\emph{shape fitting}, where we wish to approximate a set $P$ of $n$ elements (say, points) by a shape $x$ from a (possibly infinite) family $X$ of shapes. Here, each point $p\\in P$ corresponds to a function $f$ such that $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to $x$, and we seek a shape $x$ that minimizes the sum of distances from each point in $P$. In the $k$-clustering variant, each $x\\in X$ is a tuple of $k$ shapes, and $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to its closest shape in $x$.   Our main result is a unified framework for constructing {\\em coresets} and {\\em approximate clustering} for such general sets of functions. To achieve our results, we forge a link between the classic and well defined notion of $\\varepsilon$-approximations from the theory of PAC Learning and VC dimension, to the relatively new (and not so consistent) paradigm of coresets, which are some kind of \"compressed representation\" of the input set $F$. Using traditional techniques, a coreset usually implies an LTAS (linear time approximation scheme) for the corresponding optimization problem, which can be computed in parallel, via one pass over the data, and using only polylogarithmic space (i.e, in the streaming model).   We show how to generalize the results of our framework for squared distances (as in $k$-mean), distances to the $q$th power, and deterministic constructions."}
{"text": "  The main principle of stacked generalization (or Stacking) is using a second-level generalizer to combine the outputs of base classifiers in an ensemble. In this paper, we investigate different combination types under the stacking framework; namely weighted sum (WS), class-dependent weighted sum (CWS) and linear stacked generalization (LSG). For learning the weights, we propose using regularized empirical risk minimization with the hinge loss. In addition, we propose using group sparsity for regularization to facilitate classifier selection. We performed experiments using two different ensemble setups with differing diversities on 8 real-world datasets. Results show the power of regularized learning with the hinge loss function. Using sparse regularization, we are able to reduce the number of selected classifiers of the diverse ensemble without sacrificing accuracy. With the non-diverse ensembles, we even gain accuracy on average by using sparse regularization."}
{"text": "  This paper introduces a machine learning based collaborative multi-band spectrum sensing policy for cognitive radios. The proposed sensing policy guides secondary users to focus the search of unused radio spectrum to those frequencies that persistently provide them high data rate. The proposed policy is based on machine learning, which makes it adaptive with the temporally and spatially varying radio spectrum. Furthermore, there is no need for dynamic modeling of the primary activity since it is implicitly learned over time. Energy efficiency is achieved by minimizing the number of assigned sensors per each subband under a constraint on miss detection probability. It is important to control the missed detections because they cause collisions with primary transmissions and lead to retransmissions at both the primary and secondary user. Simulations show that the proposed machine learning based sensing policy improves the overall throughput of the secondary network and improves the energy efficiency while controlling the miss detection probability."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the problem of learning, from samples, the dependency structure of a system of linear stochastic differential equations, when some of the variables are latent. In particular, we observe the time evolution of some variables, and never observe other variables; from this, we would like to find the dependency structure between the observed variables - separating out the spurious interactions caused by the (marginalizing out of the) latent variables' time series. We develop a new method, based on convex optimization, to do so in the case when the number of latent variables is smaller than the number of observed ones. For the case when the dependency structure between the observed variables is sparse, we theoretically establish a high-dimensional scaling result for structure recovery. We verify our theoretical result with both synthetic and real data (from the stock market)."}

{"text": "  We introduce the Pitman Yor Diffusion Tree (PYDT) for hierarchical clustering, a generalization of the Dirichlet Diffusion Tree (Neal, 2001) which removes the restriction to binary branching structure. The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary."}
{"text": "  Estimator algorithms in learning automata are useful tools for adaptive, real-time optimization in computer science and engineering applications. This paper investigates theoretical convergence properties for a special case of estimator algorithms: the pursuit learning algorithm.

It is tradition to take the pursuit learning tuning parameter to be fixed in practical applications, but our proof sheds light on the importance of a vanishing sequence of tuning parameters in a theoretical convergence analysis."}
{"text": "  One of the major challenges of ECoG-based Brain-Machine Interfaces is the movement prediction of a human subject. Several methods exist to predict an arm 2-D trajectory. The fourth BCI Competition gives a dataset in which the aim is to predict individual finger movements (5-D trajectory). The difficulty lies in the fact that there is no simple relation between ECoG signals and finger movement. We propose in this paper to decode finger flexions using switching models. This method permits to simplify the system as it is now described as an ensemble of linear models depending on an internal state. We show that an interesting accuracy prediction can be obtained by such a model."}
{"text": "  Signal Sequence Labeling consists in predicting a sequence of labels given an observed sequence of samples. A naive way is to filter the signal in order to reduce the noise and to apply a classification algorithm on the filtered samples. We propose in this paper to jointly learn the filter with the classifier leading to a large margin filtering for classification. This method allows to learn the optimal cutoff frequency and phase of the filter that may be different from zero. Two methods are proposed and tested on a toy dataset and on a real life BCI dataset from BCI Competition III."}
{"text": "  This paper addresses the pattern classification problem arising when available target data include some uncertainty information. Target data considered here is either qualitative (a class label) or quantitative (an estimation of the posterior probability). Our main contribution is a SVM inspired formulation of this problem allowing to take into account class label through a hinge loss as well as probability estimates using epsilon-insensitive cost function together with a minimum norm (maximum margin) objective. This formulation shows a dual form leading to a quadratic problem and allows the use of a representer theorem and associated kernel. The solution provided can be used for both decision and posterior probability estimation. Based on empirical evidence our method outperforms regular SVM in terms of probability predictions and classification performances."}
{"text": "  Given a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H of real-valued functions and a suitable measure mu over the source space D (subset of R), we decompose H as the sum of a subspace of centered functions for mu and its orthogonal in H. This decomposition leads to a special case of ANOVA kernels, for which the functional ANOVA representation of the best predictor can be elegantly derived, either in an interpolation or regularization framework. The proposed kernels appear to be particularly convenient for analyzing the e ffect of each (group of) variable(s) and computing sensitivity indices without recursivity."}

{"text": "  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is now a common tool for audio source separation. When learning NMF on large audio databases, one major drawback is that the complexity in time is O(FKN) when updating the dictionary (where (F;N) is the dimension of the input power spectrograms, and K the number of basis spectra), thus forbidding its application on signals longer than an hour. We provide an online algorithm with a complexity of O(FK) in time and memory for updates in the dictionary. We show on audio simulations that the online approach is faster for short audio signals and allows to analyze audio signals of several hours."}

{"text": "  We study the problem of estimating from data, a sparse approximation to the inverse covariance matrix. Estimating a sparsity constrained inverse covariance matrix is a key component in Gaussian graphical model learning, but one that is numerically very challenging. We address this challenge by developing a new adaptive gradient-based method that carefully combines gradient information with an adaptive step-scaling strategy, which results in a scalable, highly competitive method. Our algorithm, like its predecessors, maximizes an $\\ell_1$-norm penalized log-likelihood and has the same per iteration arithmetic complexity as the best methods in its class. Our experiments reveal that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, often significantly so, for large problems."}
{"text": "  Shaping has proven to be a powerful but precarious means of improving reinforcement learning performance. Ng, Harada, and Russell (1999) proposed the potential-based shaping algorithm for adding shaping rewards in a way that guarantees the learner will learn optimal behavior. In this note, we prove certain similarities between this shaping algorithm and the initialization step required for several reinforcement learning algorithms. More specifically, we prove that a reinforcement learner with initial Q-values based on the shaping algorithm's potential function make the same updates throughout learning as a learner receiving potential-based shaping rewards. We further prove that under a broad category of policies, the behavior of these two learners are indistinguishable. The comparison provides intuition on the theoretical properties of the shaping algorithm as well as a suggestion for a simpler method for capturing the algorithm's benefit. In addition, the equivalence raises previously unaddressed issues concerning the efficiency of learning with potential-based shaping."}
{"text": "  We present IBSEAD or distributed autonomous entity systems based Interaction - a learning algorithm for the computer to self-evolve in a self-obsessed manner. This learning algorithm will present the computer to look at the internal and external environment in series of independent entities, which will interact with each other, with and/or without knowledge of the computer's brain. When a learning algorithm interacts, it does so by detecting and understanding the entities in the human algorithm. However, the problem with this approach is that the algorithm does not consider the interaction of the third party or unknown entities, which may be interacting with each other. These unknown entities in their interaction with the non-computer entities make an effect in the environment that influences the information and the behaviour of the computer brain. Such details and the ability to process the dynamic and unsettling nature of these interactions are absent in the current learning algorithm such as the decision tree learning algorithm. IBSEAD is able to evaluate and consider such algorithms and thus give us a better accuracy in simulation of the highly evolved nature of the human brain. Processes such as dreams, imagination and novelty, that exist in humans are not fully simulated by the existing learning algorithms. Also, Hidden Markov models (HMM) are useful in finding \"hidden\" entities, which may be known or unknown. However, this model fails to consider the case of unknown entities which maybe unclear or unknown. IBSEAD is better because it considers three types of entities- known, unknown and invisible. We present our case with a comparison of existing algorithms in known environments and cases and present the results of the experiments using dry run of the simulated runs of the existing machine learning algorithms versus IBSEAD."}

{"text": "  Machine Learning (ML) techniques are indispensable in a wide range of fields. Unfortunately, the exponential increase of dataset sizes are rapidly extending the runtime of sequential algorithms and threatening to slow future progress in ML. With the promise of affordable large-scale parallel computing, Cloud systems offer a viable platform to resolve the computational challenges in ML. However, designing and implementing efficient, provably correct distributed ML algorithms is often prohibitively challenging. To enable ML researchers to easily and efficiently use parallel systems, we introduced the GraphLab abstraction which is designed to represent the computational patterns in ML algorithms while permitting efficient parallel and distributed implementations. In this paper we provide a formal description of the GraphLab parallel abstraction and present an efficient distributed implementation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of GraphLab on three state-of-the-art ML algorithms using real large-scale data and a 64 node EC2 cluster of 512 processors. We find that GraphLab achieves orders of magnitude performance gains over Hadoop while performing comparably or superior to hand-tuned MPI implementations."}
{"text": "  For large scale learning problems, it is desirable if we can obtain the optimal model parameters by going through the data in only one pass. Polyak and Juditsky (1992) showed that asymptotically the test performance of the simple average of the parameters obtained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is as good as that of the parameters which minimize the empirical cost. However, to our knowledge, despite its optimal asymptotic convergence rate, averaged SGD (ASGD) received little attention in recent research on large scale learning. One possible reason is that it may take a prohibitively large number of training samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for most real problems. In this paper, we present a finite sample analysis for the method of Polyak and Juditsky (1992). Our analysis shows that it indeed usually takes a huge number of samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for improperly chosen learning rate. More importantly, based on our analysis, we propose a simple way to properly set learning rate so that it takes a reasonable amount of data for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region. We compare ASGD using our proposed learning rate with other well known algorithms for training large scale linear classifiers. The experiments clearly show the superiority of ASGD."}
{"text": "  Discovering pattern sets or global patterns is an attractive issue from the pattern mining community in order to provide useful information. By combining local patterns satisfying a joint meaning, this approach produces patterns of higher level and thus more useful for the data analyst than the usual local patterns, while reducing the number of patterns. In parallel, recent works investigating relationships between data mining and constraint programming (CP) show that the CP paradigm is a nice framework to model and mine such patterns in a declarative and generic way. We present a constraint-based language which enables us to define queries addressing patterns sets and global patterns. The usefulness of such a declarative approach is highlighted by several examples coming from the clustering based on associations. This language has been implemented in the CP framework."}

{"text": "  In many areas of machine learning, it becomes necessary to find the eigenvector decompositions of large matrices. We discuss two methods for reducing the computational burden of spectral decompositions: the more venerable Nystom extension and a newly introduced algorithm based on random projections. Previous work has centered on the ability to reconstruct the original matrix. We argue that a more interesting and relevant comparison is their relative performance in clustering and classification tasks using the approximate eigenvectors as features. We demonstrate that performance is task specific and depends on the rank of the approximation."}
{"text": "  This paper studies the deviations of the regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. When the total number of plays n is known beforehand by the agent, Audibert et al. (2009) exhibit a policy such that with probability at least 1-1/n, the regret of the policy is of order log(n). They have also shown that such a property is not shared by the popular ucb1 policy of Auer et al. (2002). This work first answers an open question: it extends this negative result to any anytime policy. The second contribution of this paper is to design anytime robust policies for specific multi-armed bandit problems in which some restrictions are put on the set of possible distributions of the different arms."}
{"text": "  This paper gives specific divergence examples of value-iteration for several major Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms, when using a function approximator for the value function. These divergence examples differ from previous divergence examples in the literature, in that they are applicable for a greedy policy, i.e. in a \"value iteration\" scenario. Perhaps surprisingly, with a greedy policy, it is also possible to get divergence for the algorithms TD(1) and Sarsa(1). In addition to these divergences, we also achieve divergence for the Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms HDP, DHP and GDHP."}
{"text": "  We provide a formal, simple and intuitive theory of rational decision making including sequential decisions that affect the environment. The theory has a geometric flavor, which makes the arguments easy to visualize and understand. Our theory is for complete decision makers, which means that they have a complete set of preferences. Our main result shows that a complete rational decision maker implicitly has a probabilistic model of the environment. We have a countable version of this result that brings light on the issue of countable vs finite additivity by showing how it depends on the geometry of the space which we have preferences over. This is achieved through fruitfully connecting rationality with the Hahn-Banach Theorem. The theory presented here can be viewed as a formalization and extension of the betting odds approach to probability of Ramsey and De Finetti."}
{"text": "  Building biological models by inferring functional dependencies from experimental data is an im- portant issue in Molecular Biology. To relieve the biologist from this traditionally manual process, various approaches have been proposed to increase the degree of automation. However, available ap- proaches often yield a single model only, rely on specific assumptions, and/or use dedicated, heuris- tic algorithms that are intolerant to changing circumstances or requirements in the view of the rapid progress made in Biotechnology. Our aim is to provide a declarative solution to the problem by ap- peal to Answer Set Programming (ASP) overcoming these difficulties. We build upon an existing approach to Automatic Network Reconstruction proposed by part of the authors. This approach has firm mathematical foundations and is well suited for ASP due to its combinatorial flavor providing a characterization of all models explaining a set of experiments. The usage of ASP has several ben- efits over the existing heuristic algorithms. First, it is declarative and thus transparent for biological experts. Second, it is elaboration tolerant and thus allows for an easy exploration and incorporation of biological constraints. Third, it allows for exploring the entire space of possible models. Finally, our approach offers an excellent performance, matching existing, special-purpose systems."}
{"text": "  In many data mining applications collection of sufficiently large datasets is the most time consuming and expensive. On the other hand, industrial methods of data collection create huge databases, and make difficult direct applications of the advanced machine learning algorithms. To address the above problems, we consider active learning (AL), which may be very efficient either for the experimental design or for the data filtering. In this paper we demonstrate using the online evaluation opportunity provided by the AL Challenge that quite competitive results may be produced using a small percentage of the available data. Also, we present several alternative criteria, which may be useful for the evaluation of the active learning processes. The author of this paper attended special presentation in Barcelona, where results of the WCCI 2010 AL Challenge were discussed."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel algebraic framework for treating probability distributions represented by their cumulants such as the mean and covariance matrix. As an example, we consider the unsupervised learning problem of finding the subspace on which several probability distributions agree. Instead of minimizing an objective function involving the estimated cumulants, we show that by treating the cumulants as elements of the polynomial ring we can directly solve the problem, at a lower computational cost and with higher accuracy. Moreover, the algebraic viewpoint on probability distributions allows us to invoke the theory of Algebraic Geometry, which we demonstrate in a compact proof for an identifiability criterion."}
{"text": "  We present a method to estimate block membership of nodes in a random graph generated by a stochastic blockmodel. We use an embedding procedure motivated by the random dot product graph model, a particular example of the latent position model. The embedding associates each node with a vector; these vectors are clustered via minimization of a square error criterion. We prove that this method is consistent for assigning nodes to blocks, as only a negligible number of nodes will be mis-assigned. We prove consistency of the method for directed and undirected graphs. The consistent block assignment makes possible consistent parameter estimation for a stochastic blockmodel. We extend the result in the setting where the number of blocks grows slowly with the number of nodes. Our method is also computationally feasible even for very large graphs. We compare our method to Laplacian spectral clustering through analysis of simulated data and a graph derived from Wikipedia documents."}
{"text": "  Detecting changes in high-dimensional time series is difficult because it involves the comparison of probability densities that need to be estimated from finite samples. In this paper, we present the first feature extraction method tailored to change point detection, which is based on an extended version of Stationary Subspace Analysis. We reduce the dimensionality of the data to the most non-stationary directions, which are most informative for detecting state changes in the time series. In extensive simulations on synthetic data we show that the accuracy of three change point detection algorithms is significantly increased by a prior feature extraction step. These findings are confirmed in an application to industrial fault monitoring."}
{"text": "  In sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), Gaussian scale mixtures (GSMs) have been used to model sparsity-inducing priors that realize a class of concave penalty functions for the regression task in real-valued signal models. Motivated by the relative scarcity of formal tools for SBL in complex-valued models, this paper proposes a GSM model - the Bessel K model - that induces concave penalty functions for the estimation of complex sparse signals. The properties of the Bessel K model are analyzed when it is applied to Type I and Type II estimation. This analysis reveals that, by tuning the parameters of the mixing pdf different penalty functions are invoked depending on the estimation type used, the value of the noise variance, and whether real or complex signals are estimated. Using the Bessel K model, we derive a sparse estimator based on a modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm formulated for Type II estimation. The estimator includes as a special instance the algorithms proposed by Tipping and Faul [1] and by Babacan et al. [2]. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed estimator over these state-of-the-art estimators in terms of convergence speed, sparseness, reconstruction error, and robustness in low and medium signal-to-noise ratio regimes."}
{"text": "  We consider the most common variants of linear regression, including Ridge, Lasso and Support-vector regression, in a setting where the learner is allowed to observe only a fixed number of attributes of each example at training time. We present simple and efficient algorithms for these problems: for Lasso and Ridge regression they need the same total number of attributes (up to constants) as do full-information algorithms, for reaching a certain accuracy. For Support-vector regression, we require exponentially less attributes compared to the state of the art. By that, we resolve an open problem recently posed by Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2010). Experiments show the theoretical bounds to be justified by superior performance compared to the state of the art."}
{"text": "  We consider online learning in partial-monitoring games against an oblivious adversary. We show that when the number of actions available to the learner is two and the game is nontrivial then it is reducible to a bandit-like game and thus the minimax regret is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$."}
{"text": "  Concave regularization methods provide natural procedures for sparse recovery. However, they are difficult to analyze in the high dimensional setting. Only recently a few sparse recovery results have been established for some specific local solutions obtained via specialized numerical procedures. Still, the fundamental relationship between these solutions such as whether they are identical or their relationship to the global minimizer of the underlying nonconvex formulation is unknown. The current paper fills this conceptual gap by presenting a general theoretical framework showing that under appropriate conditions, the global solution of nonconvex regularization leads to desirable recovery performance; moreover, under suitable conditions, the global solution corresponds to the unique sparse local solution, which can be obtained via different numerical procedures. Under this unified framework, we present an overview of existing results and discuss their connections. The unified view of this work leads to a more satisfactory treatment of concave high dimensional sparse estimation procedures, and serves as guideline for developing further numerical procedures for concave regularization."}
{"text": "  Kernel density estimation, a.k.a. Parzen windows, is a popular density estimation method, which can be used for outlier detection or clustering. With multivariate data, its performance is heavily reliant on the metric used within the kernel. Most earlier work has focused on learning only the bandwidth of the kernel (i.e., a scalar multiplicative factor). In this paper, we propose to learn a full Euclidean metric through an expectation-minimization (EM) procedure, which can be seen as an unsupervised counterpart to neighbourhood component analysis (NCA). In order to avoid overfitting with a fully nonparametric density estimator in high dimensions, we also consider a semi-parametric Gaussian-Parzen density model, where some of the variables are modelled through a jointly Gaussian density, while others are modelled through Parzen windows. For these two models, EM leads to simple closed-form updates based on matrix inversions and eigenvalue decompositions. We show empirically that our method leads to density estimators with higher test-likelihoods than natural competing methods, and that the metrics may be used within most unsupervised learning techniques that rely on such metrics, such as spectral clustering or manifold learning methods. Finally, we present a stochastic approximation scheme which allows for the use of this method in a large-scale setting."}
{"text": "  The performance of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefficient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm [\\textit{IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory} \\textbf{55} (2009) 2183--2202]. Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefficient vector, whereby one has only control on the $\\ell_1$ norm of the smaller coefficients, is also analyzed. As a consequence of these results, we also show that the coefficient estimate satisfies strong oracle type inequalities."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of learning a forest of nonlinear decision rules with general loss functions. The standard methods employ boosted decision trees such as Adaboost for exponential loss and Friedman's gradient boosting for general loss. In contrast to these traditional boosting algorithms that treat a tree learner as a black box, the method we propose directly learns decision forests via fully-corrective regularized greedy search using the underlying forest structure. Our method achieves higher accuracy and smaller models than gradient boosting (and Adaboost with exponential loss) on many datasets."}
{"text": "  One of the most prominent challenges in clustering is \"the user's dilemma,\" which is the problem of selecting an appropriate clustering algorithm for a specific task. A formal approach for addressing this problem relies on the identification of succinct, user-friendly properties that formally capture when certain clustering methods are preferred over others.   Until now these properties focused on advantages of classical Linkage-Based algorithms, failing to identify when other clustering paradigms, such as popular center-based methods, are preferable. We present surprisingly simple new properties that delineate the differences between common clustering paradigms, which clearly and formally demonstrates advantages of center-based approaches for some applications. These properties address how sensitive algorithms are to changes in element frequencies, which we capture in a generalized setting where every element is associated with a real-valued weight."}
{"text": "  There has been increased interest in devising learning techniques that combine unlabeled data with labeled data ? i.e. semi-supervised learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been performed across various techniques and different types and amounts of labeled and unlabeled data. Moreover, most of the published work on semi-supervised learning techniques assumes that the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution. It is possible for the labeling process to be associated with a selection bias such that the distributions of data points in the labeled and unlabeled sets are different. Not correcting for such bias can result in biased function approximation with potentially poor performance. In this paper, we present an empirical study of various semi-supervised learning techniques on a variety of datasets. We attempt to answer various questions such as the effect of independence or relevance amongst features, the effect of the size of the labeled and unlabeled sets and the effect of noise. We also investigate the impact of sample-selection bias on the semi-supervised learning techniques under study and implement a bivariate probit technique particularly designed to correct for such bias."}
{"text": "  The paper studies machine learning problems where each example is described using a set of Boolean features and where hypotheses are represented by linear threshold elements. One method of increasing the expressiveness of learned hypotheses in this context is to expand the feature set to include conjunctions of basic features. This can be done explicitly or where possible by using a kernel function. Focusing on the well known Perceptron and Winnow algorithms, the paper demonstrates a tradeoff between the computational efficiency with which the algorithm can be run over the expanded feature space and the generalization ability of the corresponding learning algorithm. We first describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to efficiently run the Perceptron algorithm over a feature space of exponentially many conjunctions; however we also show that using such kernels, the Perceptron algorithm can provably make an exponential number of mistakes even when learning simple functions. We then consider the question of whether kernel functions can analogously be used to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. Known upper bounds imply that the Winnow algorithm can learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting. However, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnows behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set. This implies that the kernel functions which correspond to running Winnow for this problem are not efficiently computable, and that there is no general construction that can run Winnow with kernels."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with error states. Error states are those states entering which is undesirable or dangerous. We define the risk with respect to a policy as the probability of entering such a state when the policy is pursued. We consider the problem of finding good policies whose risk is smaller than some user-specified threshold, and formalize it as a constrained MDP with two criteria. The first criterion corresponds to the value function originally given. We will show that the risk can be formulated as a second criterion function based on a cumulative return, whose definition is independent of the original value function. We present a model free, heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm that aims at finding good deterministic policies. It is based on weighting the original value function and the risk. The weight parameter is adapted in order to find a feasible solution for the constrained problem that has a good performance with respect to the value function. The algorithm was successfully applied to the control of a feed tank with stochastic inflows that lies upstream of a distillation column. This control task was originally formulated as an optimal control problem with chance constraints, and it was solved under certain assumptions on the model to obtain an optimal solution. The power of our learning algorithm is that it can be used even when some of these restrictive assumptions are relaxed."}
{"text": "  We consider a bandit problem over a graph where the rewards are not directly observed. Instead, the decision maker can compare two nodes and receive (stochastic) information pertaining to the difference in their value. The graph structure describes the set of possible comparisons. Consequently, comparing between two nodes that are relatively far requires estimating the difference between every pair of nodes on the path between them. We analyze this problem from the perspective of sample complexity: How many queries are needed to find an approximately optimal node with probability more than $1-\\delta$ in the PAC setup? We show that the topology of the graph plays a crucial in defining the sample complexity: graphs with a low diameter have a much better sample complexity."}
{"text": "  When response variables are nominal and populations are cross-classified with respect to multiple polytomies, questions often arise about the degree of association of the responses with explanatory variables. When populations are known, we introduce a nominal association vector and matrix to evaluate the dependence of a response variable with an explanatory variable. These measures provide detailed evaluations of nominal associations at both local and global levels. We also define a general class of global association measures which embraces the well known association measure by Goodman-Kruskal (1954). The proposed association matrix also gives rise to the expected generalized confusion matrix in classification. The hierarchy of equivalence relations defined by the association vector and matrix are also shown."}
{"text": "  User profiling is a useful primitive for constructing personalised services, such as content recommendation. In the present paper we investigate the feasibility of user profiling in a distributed setting, with no central authority and only local information exchanges between users. We compute a profile vector for each user (i.e., a low-dimensional vector that characterises her taste) via spectral transformation of observed user-produced ratings for items. Our two main contributions follow: i) We consider a low-rank probabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that users and items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and items within the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without prior knowledge of the compositions of the classes, based solely on few random observed ratings (namely $O(N\\log N)$ such ratings for $N$ users), we can predict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a local vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide empirical evaluations characterising the way in which spectral profiling performance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such evaluations are performed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix. ii) We develop distributed algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users into a low-dimensional space, based on spectral transformation. These involve simple message passing among users, and provably converge to the desired embedding. Our method essentially relies on a novel combination of gossiping and the algorithm proposed by Oja and Karhunen."}
{"text": "  Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and computational biology. This paper represents LDA as a factor graph within the Markov random field (MRF) framework, which enables the classic loopy belief propagation (BP) algorithm for approximate inference and parameter estimation. Although two commonly-used approximate inference methods, such as variational Bayes (VB) and collapsed Gibbs sampling (GS), have gained great successes in learning LDA, the proposed BP is competitive in both speed and accuracy as validated by encouraging experimental results on four large-scale document data sets. Furthermore, the BP algorithm has the potential to become a generic learning scheme for variants of LDA-based topic models. To this end, we show how to learn two typical variants of LDA-based topic models, such as author-topic models (ATM) and relational topic models (RTM), using BP based on the factor graph representation."}
{"text": "  We present a probabilistic model for natural images which is based on Gaussian scale mixtures and a simple multiscale representation. In contrast to the dominant approach to modeling whole images focusing on Markov random fields, we formulate our model in terms of a directed graphical model. We show that it is able to generate images with interesting higher-order correlations when trained on natural images or samples from an occlusion based model. More importantly, the directed model enables us to perform a principled evaluation. While it is easy to generate visually appealing images, we demonstrate that our model also yields the best performance reported to date when evaluated with respect to the cross-entropy rate, a measure tightly linked to the average log-likelihood."}
{"text": "  In machine learning, distance-based algorithms, and other approaches, use information that is represented by propositional data. However, this kind of representation can be quite restrictive and, in many cases, it requires more complex structures in order to represent data in a more natural way. Terms are the basis for functional and logic programming representation. Distances between terms are a useful tool not only to compare terms, but also to determine the search space in many of these applications. This dissertation applies distances between terms, exploiting the features of each distance and the possibility to compare from propositional data types to hierarchical representations. The distances between terms are applied through the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) classification algorithm using XML as a common language representation. To be able to represent these data in an XML structure and to take advantage of the benefits of distance between terms, it is necessary to apply some transformations. These transformations allow the conversion of flat data into hierarchical data represented in XML, using some techniques based on intuitive associations between the names and values of variables and associations based on attribute similarity.   Several experiments with the distances between terms of Nienhuys-Cheng and Estruch et al. were performed. In the case of originally propositional data, these distances are compared to the Euclidean distance. In all cases, the experiments were performed with the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm, using several exponents for the attraction function (weighted distance). It can be seen that in some cases, the term distances can significantly improve the results on approaches applied to flat representations."}
{"text": "  In this paper we explore noise tolerant learning of classifiers. We formulate the problem as follows. We assume that there is an ${\\bf unobservable}$ training set which is noise-free. The actual training set given to the learning algorithm is obtained from this ideal data set by corrupting the class label of each example. The probability that the class label of an example is corrupted is a function of the feature vector of the example. This would account for most kinds of noisy data one encounters in practice. We say that a learning method is noise tolerant if the classifiers learnt with the ideal noise-free data and with noisy data, both have the same classification accuracy on the noise-free data. In this paper we analyze the noise tolerance properties of risk minimization (under different loss functions), which is a generic method for learning classifiers. We show that risk minimization under 0-1 loss function has impressive noise tolerance properties and that under squared error loss is tolerant only to uniform noise; risk minimization under other loss functions is not noise tolerant. We conclude the paper with some discussion on implications of these theoretical results."}
{"text": "  Modelling the real world complexity of music is a challenge for machine learning. We address the task of modeling melodic sequences from the same music genre. We perform a comparative analysis of two probabilistic models; a Dirichlet Variable Length Markov Model (Dirichlet-VMM) and a Time Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TC-RBM). We show that the TC-RBM learns descriptive music features, such as underlying chords and typical melody transitions and dynamics. We assess the models for future prediction and compare their performance to a VMM, which is the current state of the art in melody generation. We show that both models perform significantly better than the VMM, with the Dirichlet-VMM marginally outperforming the TC-RBM. Finally, we evaluate the short order statistics of the models, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between test sequences and model samples, and show that our proposed methods match the statistics of the music genre significantly better than the VMM."}
{"text": "  Active learners alleviate the burden of labeling large amounts of data by detecting and asking the user to label only the most informative examples in the domain. We focus here on active learning for multi-view domains, in which there are several disjoint subsets of features (views), each of which is sufficient to learn the target concept. In this paper we make several contributions. First, we introduce Co-Testing, which is the first approach to multi-view active learning. Second, we extend the multi-view learning framework by also exploiting weak views, which are adequate only for learning a concept that is more general/specific than the target concept. Finally, we empirically show that Co-Testing outperforms existing active learners on a variety of real world domains such as wrapper induction, Web page classification, advertisement removal, and discourse tree parsing."}
{"text": "  Recently, a unified framework for adaptive kernel based signal processing of complex data was presented by the authors, which, besides offering techniques to map the input data to complex Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, developed a suitable Wirtinger-like Calculus for general Hilbert Spaces. In this short paper, the extended Wirtinger's calculus is adopted to derive complex kernel-based widely-linear estimation filters. Furthermore, we illuminate several important characteristics of the widely linear filters. We show that, although in many cases the gains from adopting widely linear estimation filters, as alternatives to ordinary linear ones, are rudimentary, for the case of kernel based widely linear filters significant performance improvements can be obtained."}
{"text": "  Matrix factorization from a small number of observed entries has recently garnered much attention as the key ingredient of successful recommendation systems. One unresolved problem in this area is how to adapt current methods to handle changing user preferences over time. Recent proposals to address this issue are heuristic in nature and do not fully exploit the time-dependent structure of the problem. As a principled and general temporal formulation, we propose a dynamical state space model of matrix factorization. Our proposal builds upon probabilistic matrix factorization, a Bayesian model with Gaussian priors. We utilize results in state tracking, such as the Kalman filter, to provide accurate recommendations in the presence of both process and measurement noise. We show how system parameters can be learned via expectation-maximization and provide comparisons to current published techniques."}
{"text": "  The disagreement coefficient of Hanneke has become a central data independent invariant in proving active learning rates. It has been shown in various ways that a concept class with low complexity together with a bound on the disagreement coefficient at an optimal solution allows active learning rates that are superior to passive learning ones.   We present a different tool for pool based active learning which follows from the existence of a certain uniform version of low disagreement coefficient, but is not equivalent to it. In fact, we present two fundamental active learning problems of significant interest for which our approach allows nontrivial active learning bounds. However, any general purpose method relying on the disagreement coefficient bounds only fails to guarantee any useful bounds for these problems.   The tool we use is based on the learner's ability to compute an estimator of the difference between the loss of any hypotheses and some fixed \"pivotal\" hypothesis to within an absolute error of at most $\\eps$ times the"}
{"text": "  The analysis of physiological processes over time are often given by spectrometric or gene expression profiles over time with only few time points but a large number of measured variables. The analysis of such temporal sequences is challenging and only few methods have been proposed. The information can be encoded time independent, by means of classical expression differences for a single time point or in expression profiles over time. Available methods are limited to unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The predictive variables can be identified only by means of wrapper or post-processing techniques. This is complicated due to the small number of samples for such studies. Here, we present a supervised learning approach, termed Supervised Topographic Mapping Through Time (SGTM-TT). It learns a supervised mapping of the temporal sequences onto a low dimensional grid. We utilize a hidden markov model (HMM) to account for the time domain and relevance learning to identify the relevant feature dimensions most predictive over time. The learned mapping can be used to visualize the temporal sequences and to predict the class of a new sequence. The relevance learning permits the identification of discriminating masses or gen expressions and prunes dimensions which are unnecessary for the classification task or encode mainly noise. In this way we obtain a very efficient learning system for temporal sequences. The results indicate that using simultaneous supervised learning and metric adaptation significantly improves the prediction accuracy for synthetically and real life data in comparison to the standard techniques. The discriminating features, identified by relevance learning, compare favorably with the results of alternative methods. Our method permits the visualization of the data on a low dimensional grid, highlighting the observed temporal structure."}
{"text": "  We introduce a factor analysis model that summarizes the dependencies between observed variable groups, instead of dependencies between individual variables as standard factor analysis does. A group may correspond to one view of the same set of objects, one of many data sets tied by co-occurrence, or a set of alternative variables collected from statistics tables to measure one property of interest. We show that by assuming group-wise sparse factors, active in a subset of the sets, the variation can be decomposed into factors explaining relationships between the sets and factors explaining away set-specific variation. We formulate the assumptions in a Bayesian model which provides the factors, and apply the model to two data analysis tasks, in neuroimaging and chemical systems biology."}
{"text": "  Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms try to optimize an unknown function that is expensive to evaluate using minimum number of evaluations/experiments. Most of the proposed algorithms in BO are sequential, where only one experiment is selected at each iteration. This method can be time inefficient when each experiment takes a long time and more than one experiment can be ran concurrently. On the other hand, requesting a fix-sized batch of experiments at each iteration causes performance inefficiency in BO compared to the sequential policies. In this paper, we present an algorithm that asks a batch of experiments at each time step t where the batch size p_t is dynamically determined in each step. Our algorithm is based on the observation that the sequence of experiments selected by the sequential policy can sometimes be almost independent from each other. Our algorithm identifies such scenarios and request those experiments at the same time without degrading the performance. We evaluate our proposed method using the Expected Improvement policy and the results show substantial speedup with little impact on the performance in eight real and synthetic benchmarks."}
{"text": "  This report considers how to inject external candidate solutions into the CMA-ES algorithm. The injected solutions might stem from a gradient or a Newton step, a surrogate model optimizer or any other oracle or search mechanism. They can also be the result of a repair mechanism, for example to render infeasible solutions feasible. Only small modifications to the CMA-ES are necessary to turn injection into a reliable and effective method: too long steps need to be tightly renormalized. The main objective of this report is to reveal this simple mechanism. Depending on the source of the injected solutions, interesting variants of CMA-ES arise. When the best-ever solution is always (re-)injected, an elitist variant of CMA-ES with weighted multi-recombination arises. When \\emph{all} solutions are injected from an \\emph{external} source, the resulting algorithm might be viewed as \\emph{adaptive encoding} with step-size control. In first experiments, injected solutions of very good quality lead to a convergence speed twice as fast as on the (simple) sphere function without injection. This means that we observe an impressive speed-up on otherwise difficult to solve functions. Single bad injected solutions on the other hand do no significant harm."}
{"text": "  Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data. These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold). We show that k-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query x and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at x vary with radius.   Furthermore, we show a simple way to choose k = k(x) locally at any x so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at x in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of x. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure."}
{"text": "  There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that exact nearest neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces is affected by the curse of dimensionality at a fundamental level. Does it necessarily mean that the same is true for k nearest neighbours based learning algorithms such as the k-NN classifier? We analyse this question at a number of levels and show that the answer is different at each of them. As our first main observation, we show the consistency of a k approximate nearest neighbour classifier. However, the performance of the classifier in very high dimensions is provably unstable. As our second main observation, we point out that the existing model for statistical learning is oblivious of dimension of the domain and so every learning problem admits a universally consistent deterministic reduction to the one-dimensional case by means of a Borel isomorphism."}
{"text": "  We propose a method to efficiently construct data-dependent kernels which can make use of large quantities of (unlabeled) data. Our construction makes an approximation in the standard construction of semi-supervised kernels in Sindhwani et al. 2005. In typical cases these kernels can be computed in nearly-linear time (in the amount of data), improving on the cubic time of the standard construction, enabling large scale semi-supervised learning in a variety of contexts. The methods are validated on semi-supervised and unsupervised problems on data sets containing upto 64,000 sample points."}
{"text": "  Recent work in signal processing and statistics have focused on defining new regularization functions, which not only induce sparsity of the solution, but also take into account the structure of the problem. We present in this paper a class of convex penalties introduced in the machine learning community, which take the form of a sum of l_2 and l_infinity-norms over groups of variables. They extend the classical group-sparsity regularization in the sense that the groups possibly overlap, allowing more flexibility in the group design. We review efficient optimization methods to deal with the corresponding inverse problems, and their application to the problem of learning dictionaries of natural image patches: On the one hand, dictionary learning has indeed proven effective for various signal processing tasks. On the other hand, structured sparsity provides a natural framework for modeling dependencies between dictionary elements. We thus consider a structured sparse regularization to learn dictionaries embedded in a particular structure, for instance a tree or a two-dimensional grid. In the latter case, the results we obtain are similar to the dictionaries produced by topographic independent component analysis."}
{"text": "  We propose a method called ideal regression for approximating an arbitrary system of polynomial equations by a system of a particular type. Using techniques from approximate computational algebraic geometry, we show how we can solve ideal regression directly without resorting to numerical optimization. Ideal regression is useful whenever the solution to a learning problem can be described by a system of polynomial equations. As an example, we demonstrate how to formulate Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA), a source separation problem, in terms of ideal regression, which also yields a consistent estimator for SSA. We then compare this estimator in simulations with previous optimization-based approaches for SSA."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we describe our approach to the Wikipedia Participation Challenge which aims to predict the number of edits a Wikipedia editor will make in the next 5 months. The best submission from our team, \"zeditor\", achieved 41.7% improvement over WMF's baseline predictive model and the final rank of 3rd place among 96 teams. An interesting characteristic of our approach is that only temporal dynamics features (i.e., how the number of edits changes in recent periods, etc.) are used in a self-supervised learning framework, which makes it easy to be generalised to other application domains."}
{"text": "  We consider a Gaussian process formulation of the multiple kernel learning problem. The goal is to select the convex combination of kernel matrices that best explains the data and by doing so improve the generalisation on unseen data. Sparsity in the kernel weights is obtained by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach: Gaussian process priors are imposed over the latent functions and generalised inverse Gaussians on their associated weights. This construction is equivalent to imposing a product of heavy-tailed process priors over function space. A variational inference algorithm is derived for regression and binary classification."}
{"text": "  We propose a scalable, efficient and statistically motivated computational framework for Graphical Lasso (Friedman et al., 2007b) - a covariance regularization framework that has received significant attention in the statistics community over the past few years. Existing algorithms have trouble in scaling to dimensions larger than a thousand. Our proposal significantly enhances the state-of-the-art for such moderate sized problems and gracefully scales to larger problems where other algorithms become practically infeasible. This requires a few key new ideas. We operate on the primal problem and use a subtle variation of block-coordinate-methods which drastically reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the convergence and complexity of our algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal via experiments. We believe that our framework extends the applicability of Graphical Lasso to large-scale modern applications like bioinformatics, collaborative filtering and social networks, among others."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel method of introducing structure into existing machine learning techniques by developing structure-based similarity and distance measures. To learn structural information, low-dimensional structure of the data is captured by solving a non-linear, low-rank representation problem. We show that this low-rank representation can be kernelized, has a closed-form solution, allows for separation of independent manifolds, and is robust to noise. From this representation, similarity between observations based on non-linear structure is computed and can be incorporated into existing feature transformations, dimensionality reduction techniques, and machine learning methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show performance improvements for clustering, and anomaly detection through the use of structural similarity."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a method of choosing number of states of a HMM based on number of critical points of the motion capture data. The choice of Hidden Markov Models(HMM) parameters is crucial for recognizer's performance as it is the first step of the training and cannot be corrected automatically within HMM. In this article we define predictor of number of states based on number of critical points of the sequence and test its effectiveness against sample data."}
{"text": "  Most methods for decision-theoretic online learning are based on the Hedge algorithm, which takes a parameter called the learning rate. In most previous analyses the learning rate was carefully tuned to obtain optimal worst-case performance, leading to suboptimal performance on easy instances, for example when there exists an action that is significantly better than all others. We propose a new way of setting the learning rate, which adapts to the difficulty of the learning problem: in the worst case our procedure still guarantees optimal performance, but on easy instances it achieves much smaller regret. In particular, our adaptive method achieves constant regret in a probabilistic setting, when there exists an action that on average obtains strictly smaller loss than all other actions. We also provide a simulation study comparing our approach to existing methods."}
{"text": "  We develop a new tool for data-dependent analysis of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in learning under limited feedback. Our tool is based on two main ingredients. The first ingredient is a new concentration inequality that makes it possible to control the concentration of weighted averages of multiple (possibly uncountably many) simultaneously evolving and interdependent martingales. The second ingredient is an application of this inequality to the exploration-exploitation trade-off via importance weighted sampling. We apply the new tool to the stochastic multiarmed bandit problem, however, the main importance of this paper is the development and understanding of the new tool rather than improvement of existing algorithms for stochastic multiarmed bandits. In the follow-up work we demonstrate that the new tool can improve over state-of-the-art in structurally richer problems, such as stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (Seldin et al., 2011a)."}
{"text": "  Structured classification tasks such as sequence labeling and dependency parsing have seen much interest by the Natural Language Processing and the machine learning communities. Several online learning algorithms were adapted for structured tasks such as Perceptron, Passive- Aggressive and the recently introduced Confidence-Weighted learning . These online algorithms are easy to implement, fast to train and yield state-of-the-art performance. However, unlike probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Model and Conditional random fields, these methods generate models that output merely a prediction with no additional information regarding confidence in the correctness of the output. In this work we fill the gap proposing few alternatives to compute the confidence in the output of non-probabilistic algorithms.We show how to compute confidence estimates in the prediction such that the confidence reflects the probability that the word is labeled correctly. We then show how to use our methods to detect mislabeled words, trade recall for precision and active learning. We evaluate our methods on four noun-phrase chunking and named entity recognition sequence labeling tasks, and on dependency parsing for 14 languages."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose and study a generalization of the standard active-learning model where a more general type of query, class conditional query, is allowed. Such queries have been quite useful in applications, but have been lacking theoretical understanding. In this work, we characterize the power of such queries under two well-known noise models. We give nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the number of queries needed to learn both for the general agnostic setting and for the bounded noise model. We further show that our methods can be made adaptive to the (unknown) noise rate, with only negligible loss in query complexity."}
{"text": "  The popular cubic smoothing spline estimate of a regression function arises as the minimizer of the penalized sum of squares $\\sum_j(Y_j - {\\mu}(t_j))^2 + {\\lambda}\\int_a^b [{\\mu}\"(t)]^2 dt$, where the data are $t_j,Y_j$, $j=1,..., n$. The minimization is taken over an infinite-dimensional function space, the space of all functions with square integrable second derivatives. But the calculations can be carried out in a finite-dimensional space. The reduction from minimizing over an infinite dimensional space to minimizing over a finite dimensional space occurs for more general objective functions: the data may be related to the function ${\\mu}$ in another way, the sum of squares may be replaced by a more suitable expression, or the penalty, $\\int_a^b [{\\mu}\"(t)]^2 dt$, might take a different form. This paper reviews the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space structure that provides a finite-dimensional solution for a general minimization problem. Particular attention is paid to penalties based on linear differential operators. In this case, one can sometimes easily calculate the minimizer explicitly, using Green's functions."}
{"text": "  Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a fundamental measure of the generalization capacity of learning algorithms. However, apart from a few special cases, it is hard or impossible to calculate analytically. Vapnik et al. [10] proposed a technique for estimating the VC dimension empirically. While their approach behaves well in simulations, it could not be used to bound the generalization risk of classifiers, because there were no bounds for the estimation error of the VC dimension itself. We rectify this omission, providing high probability concentration results for the proposed estimator and deriving corresponding generalization bounds."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we give a new generalization error bound of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) for a general class of regularizations, and discuss what kind of regularization gives a favorable predictive accuracy. Our main target in this paper is dense type regularizations including \\ellp-MKL. According to the recent numerical experiments, the sparse regularization does not necessarily show a good performance compared with dense type regularizations. Motivated by this fact, this paper gives a general theoretical tool to derive fast learning rates of MKL that is applicable to arbitrary mixed-norm-type regularizations in a unifying manner. This enables us to compare the generalization performances of various types of regularizations. As a consequence, we observe that the homogeneity of the complexities of candidate reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) affects which regularization strategy (\\ell1 or dense) is preferred. In fact, in homogeneous complexity settings where the complexities of all RKHSs are evenly same, \\ell1-regularization is optimal among all isotropic norms. On the other hand, in inhomogeneous complexity settings, dense type regularizations can show better learning rate than sparse \\ell1-regularization. We also show that our learning rate achieves the minimax lower bound in homogeneous complexity settings."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-armed bandits with a large, possibly infinite number of correlated arms. We assume that the arms have Bernoulli distributed rewards, independent across time, where the probabilities of success are parametrized by known attribute vectors for each arm, as well as an unknown preference vector, each of dimension $n$. For this model, we seek an algorithm with a total regret that is sub-linear in time and independent of the number of arms. We present such an algorithm, which we call the Two-Phase Algorithm, and analyze its performance. We show upper bounds on the total regret which applies uniformly in time, for both the finite and infinite arm cases. The asymptotics of the finite arm bound show that for any $f \\in \\omega(\\log(T))$, the total regret can be made to be $O(n \\cdot f(T))$. In the infinite arm case, the total regret is $O(\\sqrt{n^3 T})$."}
{"text": "  We present a framework for performing efficient regression in general metric spaces. Roughly speaking, our regressor predicts the value at a new point by computing a Lipschitz extension --- the smoothest function consistent with the observed data --- after performing structural risk minimization to avoid overfitting. We obtain finite-sample risk bounds with minimal structural and noise assumptions, and a natural speed-precision tradeoff. The offline (learning) and online (prediction) stages can be solved by convex programming, but this naive approach has runtime complexity $O(n^3)$, which is prohibitive for large datasets. We design instead a regression algorithm whose speed and generalization performance depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data, to which the algorithm adapts. While our main innovation is algorithmic, the statistical results may also be of independent interest."}
{"text": "  Spectral clustering is a novel clustering method which can detect complex shapes of data clusters. However, it requires the eigen decomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix, which is proportion to $O(n^3)$ and thus is not suitable for large scale systems. Recently, many methods have been proposed to accelerate the computational time of spectral clustering. These approximate methods usually involve sampling techniques by which a lot information of the original data may be lost. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate spectral clustering approach using an approximate commute time embedding, which is similar to the spectral embedding. The method does not require using any sampling technique and computing any eigenvector at all. Instead it uses random projection and a linear time solver to find the approximate embedding. The experiments in several synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach has better clustering quality and is faster than the state-of-the-art approximate spectral clustering methods."}
{"text": "  This paper addresses the problem of segmenting a time-series with respect to changes in the mean value or in the variance. The first case is when the time data is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random variables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The main assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the task is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments. The second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can change. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and we want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments. To find solutions to these problems, we will study an l_1 regularized maximum likelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l_1 trend filtering, where the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To penalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l_1-norm of the time difference of the parameters is used as a regularization term. This idea is closely related to total variation denoising. The main contribution is that a convex formulation of this variance estimation problem, where the parametrization is based on the inverse of the variance, can be formulated as a certain l_1 mean estimation problem. This implies that results and methods for mean estimation can be applied to the challenging problem of variance segmentation/estimation."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose a framework for solving constrained online convex optimization problem. Our motivation stems from the observation that most algorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto the convex set $\\mathcal{K}$ from which the decisions are made. While for simple shapes (e.g. Euclidean ball) the projection is straightforward, for arbitrary complex sets this is the main computational challenge and may be inefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online convex optimization problem. Instead of requiring decisions belong to $\\mathcal{K}$ for all rounds, we only require that the constraints which define the set $\\mathcal{K}$ be satisfied in the long run. We show that our framework can be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side constraints addressed in \\cite{DBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06} and \\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08}. By turning the problem into an online convex-concave optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm which achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ bound for the violation of constraints. Then we modify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied in the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on the Mirror Prox method \\citep{nemirovski-2005-prox} to solve variational inequalities which achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{\\mathcal{O}}}(T^{2/3})$ bound for both regret and the violation of constraints when the domain $\\K$ can be described by a finite number of linear constraints. Finally, we extend the result to the setting where we only have partial access to the convex set $\\mathcal{K}$ and propose a multipoint bandit feedback algorithm with the same bounds in expectation as our first algorithm."}
{"text": "  We consider a standard binary classification problem. The performance of any binary classifier based on the training data is characterized by the excess risk. We study Bahadur's type exponential bounds on the minimax accuracy confidence function based on the excess risk. We study how this quantity depends on the complexity of the class of distributions characterized by exponents of entropies of the class of regression functions or of the class of Bayes classifiers corresponding to the distributions from the class. We also study its dependence on margin parameters of the classification problem."}
{"text": "  Gaussian process models -also called Kriging models- are often used as mathematical approximations of expensive experiments. However, the number of observation required for building an emulator becomes unrealistic when using classical covariance kernels when the dimension of input increases. In oder to get round the curse of dimensionality, a popular approach is to consider simplified models such as additive models. The ambition of the present work is to give an insight into covariance kernels that are well suited for building additive Kriging models and to describe some properties of the resulting models."}
{"text": "  We describe many vantage points on the Baire metric and its use in clustering data, or its use in preprocessing and structuring data in order to support search and retrieval operations. In some cases, we proceed directly to clusters and do not directly determine the distances. We show how a hierarchical clustering can be read directly from one pass through the data. We offer insights also on practical implications of precision of data measurement. As a mechanism for treating multidimensional data, including very high dimensional data, we use random projections."}
{"text": "  In citep{Hazan-2008-extract}, the authors showed that the regret of online linear optimization can be bounded by the total variation of the cost vectors. In this paper, we extend this result to general online convex optimization. We first analyze the limitations of the algorithm in \\citep{Hazan-2008-extract} when applied it to online convex optimization. We then present two algorithms for online convex optimization whose regrets are bounded by the variation of cost functions. We finally consider the bandit setting, and present a randomized algorithm for online bandit convex optimization with a variation-based regret bound. We show that the regret bound for online bandit convex optimization is optimal when the variation of cost functions is independent of the number of trials."}
{"text": "  While Gaussian probability densities are omnipresent in applied mathematics, Gaussian cumulative probabilities are hard to calculate in any but the univariate case. We study the utility of Expectation Propagation (EP) as an approximate integration method for this problem. For rectangular integration regions, the approximation is highly accurate. We also extend the derivations to the more general case of polyhedral integration regions. However, we find that in this polyhedral case, EP's answer, though often accurate, can be almost arbitrarily wrong. We consider these unexpected results empirically and theoretically, both for the problem of Gaussian probabilities and for EP more generally. These results elucidate an interesting and non-obvious feature of EP not yet studied in detail."}
{"text": "  Information-maximization clustering learns a probabilistic classifier in an unsupervised manner so that mutual information between feature vectors and cluster assignments is maximized. A notable advantage of this approach is that it only involves continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially easier to solve than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve non-convex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this paper, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is largely unrepresented.   Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general tasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how the proposed theory relates to previous information-theoretic objectives of behavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, and how it might contribute to a general theory of exploratory behavior."}

{"text": "  Unsupervised aggregation of independently built univariate predictors is explored as an alternative regularization approach for noisy, sparse datasets. Bipartite ranking algorithm Smooth Rank implementing this approach is introduced. The advantages of this algorithm are demonstrated on two types of problems. First, Smooth Rank is applied to two-class problems from bio-medical field, where ranking is often preferable to classification. In comparison against SVMs with radial and linear kernels, Smooth Rank had the best performance on 8 out of 12 benchmark benchmarks. The second area of application is survival analysis, which is reduced here to bipartite ranking in a way which allows one to use commonly accepted measures of methods performance. In comparison of Smooth Rank with Cox PH regression and CoxPath methods, Smooth Rank proved to be the best on 9 out of 10 benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  The asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic approximation of Benaim, Hofbauer and Sorin is extended for asynchronous stochastic approximations with a set-valued mean field. The asynchronicity of the process is incorporated into the mean field to produce convergence results which remain similar to those of an equivalent synchronous process. In addition, this allows many of the restrictive assumptions previously associated with asynchronous stochastic approximation to be removed. The framework is extended for a coupled asynchronous stochastic approximation process with set-valued mean fields. Two-timescales arguments are used here in a similar manner to the original work in this area by Borkar. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through learning in a Markov decision process."}
{"text": "  Exact inference in the linear regression model with spike and slab priors is often intractable. Expectation propagation (EP) can be used for approximate inference. However, the regular sequential form of EP (R-EP) may fail to converge in this model when the size of the training set is very small. As an alternative, we propose a provably convergent EP algorithm (PC-EP). PC-EP is proved to minimize an energy function which, under some constraints, is bounded from below and whose stationary points coincide with the solution of R-EP. Experiments with synthetic data indicate that when R-EP does not converge, the approximation generated by PC-EP is often better. By contrast, when R-EP converges, both methods perform similarly."}
{"text": "  Unbalanced data arises in many learning tasks such as clustering of multi-class data, hierarchical divisive clustering and semisupervised learning. Graph-based approaches are popular tools for these problems. Graph construction is an important aspect of graph-based learning. We show that graph-based algorithms can fail for unbalanced data for many popular graphs such as k-NN, \\epsilon-neighborhood and full-RBF graphs. We propose a novel graph construction technique that encodes global statistical information into node degrees through a ranking scheme. The rank of a data sample is an estimate of its p-value and is proportional to the total number of data samples with smaller density. This ranking scheme serves as a surrogate for density; can be reliably estimated; and indicates whether a data sample is close to valleys/modes. This rank-modulated degree(RMD) scheme is able to significantly sparsify the graph near valleys and provides an adaptive way to cope with unbalanced data. We then theoretically justify our method through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method."}
{"text": "  In this article, we have proposed several approaches for post processing a large ensemble of prediction models or rules. The results from our simulations show that the post processing methods we have considered here are promising. We have used the techniques developed here for estimation of quantitative traits from markers, on the benchmark \"Bostob Housing\"data set and in some simulations. In most cases, the produced models had better prediction performance than, for example, the ones produced by the random forest or the rulefit algorithms."}
{"text": "  We investigate a recently proposed family of positive-definite kernels that mimic the computation in large neural networks. We examine the properties of these kernels using tools from differential geometry; specifically, we analyze the geometry of surfaces in Hilbert space that are induced by these kernels. When this geometry is described by a Riemannian manifold, we derive results for the metric, curvature, and volume element. Interestingly, though, we find that the simplest kernel in this family does not admit such an interpretation. We explore two variations of these kernels that mimic computation in neural networks with different activation functions. We experiment with these new kernels on several data sets and highlight their general trends in performance for classification."}
{"text": "  We show how to incorporate information from labeled examples into nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. In addition to mapping the data into a space of lower dimensionality, our approach aims to preserve the nonnegative components of the data that are important for classification. We identify these components from the support vectors of large-margin classifiers and derive iterative updates to preserve them in a semi-supervised version of NMF. These updates have a simple multiplicative form like their unsupervised counterparts; they are also guaranteed at each iteration to decrease their loss function---a weighted sum of I-divergences that captures the trade-off between unsupervised and supervised learning. We evaluate these updates for dimensionality reduction when they are used as a precursor to linear classification. In this role, we find that they yield much better performance than their unsupervised counterparts. We also find one unexpected benefit of the low dimensional representations discovered by our approach: often they yield more accurate classifiers than both ordinary and transductive SVMs trained in the original input space."}
{"text": "  This paper is devoted to regret lower bounds in the classical model of stochastic multi-armed bandit. A well-known result of Lai and Robbins, which has then been extended by Burnetas and Katehakis, has established the presence of a logarithmic bound for all consistent policies. We relax the notion of consistence, and exhibit a generalisation of the logarithmic bound. We also show the non existence of logarithmic bound in the general case of Hannan consistency. To get these results, we study variants of popular Upper Confidence Bounds (ucb) policies. As a by-product, we prove that it is impossible to design an adaptive policy that would select the best of two algorithms by taking advantage of the properties of the environment."}
{"text": "  This paper provides a theoretical support for clustering aspect of the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). By utilizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, we show that NMF objective is equivalent to graph clustering objective, so clustering aspect of the NMF has a solid justification. Different from previous approaches which usually discard the nonnegativity constraints, our approach guarantees the stationary point being used in deriving the equivalence is located on the feasible region in the nonnegative orthant. Additionally, since clustering capability of a matrix decomposition technique can sometimes imply its latent semantic indexing (LSI) aspect, we will also evaluate LSI aspect of the NMF by showing its capability in solving the synonymy and polysemy problems in synthetic datasets. And more extensive evaluation will be conducted by comparing LSI performances of the NMF and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the standard LSI method, using some standard datasets."}
{"text": "  The selection of the best classification algorithm for a given dataset is a very widespread problem, occuring each time one has to choose a classifier to solve a real-world problem. It is also a complex task with many important methodological decisions to make. Among those, one of the most crucial is the choice of an appropriate measure in order to properly assess the classification performance and rank the algorithms. In this article, we focus on this specific task. We present the most popular measures and compare their behavior through discrimination plots. We then discuss their properties from a more theoretical perspective. It turns out several of them are equivalent for classifiers comparison purposes. Futhermore. they can also lead to interpretation problems. Among the numerous measures proposed over the years, it appears that the classical overall success rate and marginal rates are the more suitable for classifier comparison task."}
{"text": "  We propose a new, nonparametric approach to estimating the value function in reinforcement learning. This approach makes use of a recently developed representation of conditional distributions as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Such representations bypass the need for estimating transition probabilities, and apply to any domain on which kernels can be defined. Our approach avoids the need to approximate intractable integrals since expectations are represented as RKHS inner products whose computation has linear complexity in the sample size. Thus, we can efficiently perform value function estimation in a wide variety of settings, including finite state spaces, continuous states spaces, and partially observable tasks where only sensor measurements are available. A second advantage of the approach is that we learn the conditional distribution representation from a training sample, and do not require an exhaustive exploration of the state space. We prove convergence of our approach either to the optimal policy, or to the closest projection of the optimal policy in our model class, under reasonable assumptions. In experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a learning task in a continuous state space (the under-actuated pendulum), and on a navigation problem where only images from a sensor are observed. We compare with least-squares policy iteration where a Gaussian process is used for value function estimation. Our algorithm achieves better performance in both tasks."}
{"text": "  Selecting the best classifier among the available ones is a difficult task, especially when only instances of one class exist. In this work we examine the notion of combining one-class classifiers as an alternative for selecting the best classifier. In particular, we propose two new one-class classification performance measures to weigh classifiers and show that a simple ensemble that implements these measures can outperform the most popular one-class ensembles. Furthermore, we propose a new one-class ensemble scheme, TUPSO, which uses meta-learning to combine one-class classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of TUPSO over all other tested ensembles and show that the TUPSO performance is statistically indistinguishable from that of the hypothetical best classifier."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8% accuracy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "  Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning manifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear} dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data."}
{"text": "  Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) has focused on problems involving many states and few actions, such as simple grid worlds. Most real world problems, however, are of the opposite type, Involving Few relevant states and many actions. For example, to return home from a conference, humans identify only few subgoal states such as lobby, taxi, airport etc. Each valid behavior connecting two such states can be viewed as an action, and there are trillions of them. Assuming the subgoal identification problem is already solved, the quality of any RL method---in real-world settings---depends less on how well it scales with the number of states than on how well it scales with the number of actions. This is where our new method T-Learning excels, by evaluating the relatively few possible transits from one state to another in a policy-independent way, rather than a huge number of state-action pairs, or states in traditional policy-dependent ways. Illustrative experiments demonstrate that performance improvements of T-Learning over Q-learning can be arbitrarily large."}
{"text": "  Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and computational biology. This paper introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP) based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms. TMBP toolbox is implemented by MEX C++/Matlab/Octave for either Windows 7 or Linux. Compared with existing topic modeling packages, the novelty of this toolbox lies in the BP algorithms for learning LDA-based topic models. The current version includes BP algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), author-topic models (ATM), relational topic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an ongoing project and more BP-based algorithms for various topic models will be added in the near future.

{"text": "  Leveraging the power of increasing amounts of data to analyze customer base for attracting and retaining the most valuable customers is a major problem facing companies in this information age. Data mining technologies extract hidden information and knowledge from large data stored in databases or data warehouses, thereby supporting the corporate decision making process. CRM uses data mining (one of the elements of CRM) techniques to interact with customers. This study investigates the use of a technique, semi-supervised learning, for the management and analysis of customer-related data warehouse and information. The idea of semi-supervised learning is to learn not only from the labeled training data, but to exploit also the structural information in additionally available unlabeled data. The proposed semi-supervised method is a model by means of a feed-forward neural network trained by a back propagation algorithm (multi-layer perceptron) in order to predict the category of an unknown customer (potential customers). In addition, this technique can be used with Rapid Miner tools for both labeled and unlabeled data."}
{"text": "  Diabetes is a major health problem in both developing and developed countries and its incidence is rising dramatically. In this study, we investigate a novel automatic approach to diagnose Diabetes disease based on Feature Weighted Support Vector Machines (FW-SVMs) and Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS). The proposed model consists of three stages: Firstly, PCA is applied to select an optimal subset of features out of set of all the features. Secondly, Mutual Information is employed to construct the FWSVM by weighting different features based on their degree of importance. Finally, since parameter selection plays a vital role in classification accuracy of SVMs, MCS is applied to select the best parameter values. The proposed MI-MCS-FWSVM method obtains 93.58% accuracy on UCI dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous methods by not only giving more accurate results but also significantly speeding up the classification procedure."}
{"text": "  We present a novel approach to learn a kernel-based regression function. It is based on the useof conical combinations of data-based parameterized kernels and on a new stochastic convex optimization procedure of which we establish convergence guarantees. The overall learning procedure has the nice properties that a) the learned conical combination is automatically designed to perform the regression task at hand and b) the updates implicated by the optimization procedure are quite inexpensive. In order to shed light on the appositeness of our learning strategy, we present empirical results from experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  Teaching is one of the most important factors affecting any education system. Many research efforts have been conducted to facilitate the presentation modes used by instructors in classrooms as well as provide means for students to review lectures through web browsers. Other studies have been made to provide acoustical design recommendations for classrooms like room size and reverberation times. However, using acoustical features of classrooms as a way to provide education systems with feedback about the learning process was not thoroughly investigated in any of these studies. We propose a system that extracts different sound features of students and instructors, and then uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the acoustical quality of any learning environment. We infer conclusions about the students' satisfaction with the quality of lectures. Using classifiers instead of surveys and other subjective ways of measures can facilitate and speed such experiments which enables us to perform them continuously. We believe our system enables education systems to continuously review and improve their teaching strategies and acoustical quality of classrooms."}
{"text": "  This paper develops a general theoretical framework to analyze structured sparse recovery problems using the notation of dual certificate. Although certain aspects of the dual certificate idea have already been used in some previous work, due to the lack of a general and coherent theory, the analysis has so far only been carried out in limited scopes for specific problems. In this context the current paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a general definition of dual certificate, which we then use to develop a unified theory of sparse recovery analysis for convex programming. Second, we present a class of structured sparsity regularization called structured Lasso for which calculations can be readily performed under our theoretical framework. This new theory includes many seemingly loosely related previous work as special cases; it also implies new results that improve existing ones even for standard formulations such as L1 regularization."}
{"text": "  We study the non-smooth optimization problems in machine learning, where both the loss function and the regularizer are non-smooth functions. Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimization problem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual prox method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of $O(1/T)$ {assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved}, significantly faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposed method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods."}
{"text": "  In the current competitive world, industrial companies seek to manufacture products of higher quality which can be achieved by increasing reliability, maintainability and thus the availability of products. On the other hand, improvement in products lifecycle is necessary for achieving high reliability. Typically, maintenance activities are aimed to reduce failures of industrial machinery and minimize the consequences of such failures. So the industrial companies try to improve their efficiency by using different fault detection techniques. One strategy is to process and analyze previous generated data to predict future failures. The purpose of this paper is to detect wasted parts using different data mining algorithms and compare the accuracy of these algorithms. A combination of thermal and physical characteristics has been used and the algorithms were implemented on Ahanpishegan's current data to estimate the availability of its produced parts.

{"text": "  In many situations where the interest lies in identifying clusters one might expect that not all available variables carry information about these groups. Furthermore, data quality (e.g. outliers or missing entries) might present a serious and sometimes hard-to-assess problem for large and complex datasets. In this paper we show that a small proportion of atypical observations might have serious adverse effects on the solutions found by the sparse clustering algorithm of Witten and Tibshirani (2010). We propose a robustification of their sparse K-means algorithm based on the trimmed K-means algorithm of Cuesta-Albertos et al. (1997) Our proposal is also able to handle datasets with missing values. We illustrate the use of our method on microarray data for cancer patients where we are able to identify strong biological clusters with a much reduced number of genes. Our simulation studies show that, when there are outliers in the data, our robust sparse K-means algorithm performs better than other competing methods both in terms of the selection of features and also the identified clusters. This robust sparse K-means algorithm is implemented in the R package RSKC which is publicly available from the CRAN repository."}
{"text": "  Clustering is considered a non-supervised learning setting, in which the goal is to partition a collection of data points into disjoint clusters. Often a bound $k$ on the number of clusters is given or assumed by the practitioner. Many versions of this problem have been defined, most notably $k$-means and $k$-median.   An underlying problem with the unsupervised nature of clustering it that of determining a similarity function. One approach for alleviating this difficulty is known as clustering with side information, alternatively, semi-supervised clustering. Here, the practitioner incorporates side information in the form of \"must be clustered\" or \"must be separated\" labels for data point pairs. Each such piece of information comes at a \"query cost\" (often involving human response solicitation). The collection of labels is then incorporated in the usual clustering algorithm as either strict or as soft constraints, possibly adding a pairwise constraint penalty function to the chosen clustering objective.   Our work is mostly related to clustering with side information. We ask how to choose the pairs of data points. Our analysis gives rise to a method provably better than simply choosing them uniformly at random. Roughly speaking, we show that the distribution must be biased so as more weight is placed on pairs incident to elements in smaller clusters in some optimal solution. Of course we do not know the optimal solution, hence we don't know the bias. Using the recently introduced method of $\\eps$-smooth relative regret approximations of Ailon, Begleiter and Ezra, we can show an iterative process that improves both the clustering and the bias in tandem. The process provably converges to the optimal solution faster (in terms of query cost) than an algorithm selecting pairs uniformly."}
{"text": "  Many modern data mining applications are concerned with the analysis of datasets in which the observations are described by paired high-dimensional vectorial representations or \"views\". Some typical examples can be found in web mining and genomics applications. In this article we present an algorithm for data clustering with multiple views, Multi-View Predictive Partitioning (MVPP), which relies on a novel criterion of predictive similarity between data points. We assume that, within each cluster, the dependence between multivariate views can be modelled by using a two-block partial least squares (TB-PLS) regression model, which performs dimensionality reduction and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional settings. The proposed MVPP algorithm partitions the data such that the within-cluster predictive ability between views is maximised. The proposed objective function depends on a measure of predictive influence of points under the TB-PLS model which has been derived as an extension of the PRESS statistic commonly used in ordinary least squares regression. Using simulated data, we compare the performance of MVPP to that of competing multi-view clustering methods which rely upon geometric structures of points, but ignore the predictive relationship between the two views. State-of-art results are obtained on benchmark web mining datasets."}
{"text": "  Contextual bandit learning is a reinforcement learning problem where the learner repeatedly receives a set of features (context), takes an action and receives a reward based on the action and context. We consider this problem under a realizability assumption: there exists a function in a (known) function class, always capable of predicting the expected reward, given the action and context. Under this assumption, we show three things. We present a new algorithm---Regressor Elimination--- with a regret similar to the agnostic setting (i.e. in the absence of realizability assumption). We prove a new lower bound showing no algorithm can achieve superior performance in the worst case even with the realizability assumption. However, we do show that for any set of policies (mapping contexts to actions), there is a distribution over rewards (given context) such that our new algorithm has constant regret unlike the previous approaches."}
{"text": "  Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) addresses the problem of recovering a task description given a demonstration of the optimal policy used to solve such a task. The optimal policy is usually provided by an expert or teacher, making IRL specially suitable for the problem of apprenticeship learning. The task description is encoded in the form of a reward function of a Markov decision process (MDP). Several algorithms have been proposed to find the reward function corresponding to a set of demonstrations. One of the algorithms that has provided best results in different applications is a gradient method to optimize a policy squared error criterion. On a parallel line of research, other authors have presented recently a gradient approximation of the maximum likelihood estimate of the reward signal. In general, both approaches approximate the gradient estimate and the criteria at different stages to make the algorithm tractable and efficient. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the different methods to highlight differences in terms of reward estimation, policy similarity and computational costs. We also provide experimental results to evaluate the differences in performance of the methods."}
{"text": "  We propose a new yet natural algorithm for learning the graph structure of general discrete graphical models (a.k.a. Markov random fields) from samples. Our algorithm finds the neighborhood of a node by sequentially adding nodes that produce the largest reduction in empirical conditional entropy; it is greedy in the sense that the choice of addition is based only on the reduction achieved at that iteration. Its sequential nature gives it a lower computational complexity as compared to other existing comparison-based techniques, all of which involve exhaustive searches over every node set of a certain size. Our main result characterizes the sample complexity of this procedure, as a function of node degrees, graph size and girth in factor-graph representation. We subsequently specialize this result to the case of Ising models, where we provide a simple transparent characterization of sample complexity as a function of model and graph parameters.   For tree graphs, our algorithm is the same as the classical Chow-Liu algorithm, and in that sense can be considered the extension of the same to graphs with cycles."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a semiparametric approach, named nonparanormal skeptic, for efficiently and robustly estimating high dimensional undirected graphical models. To achieve modeling flexibility, we consider Gaussian Copula graphical models (or the nonparanormal) as proposed by Liu et al. (2009). To achieve estimation robustness, we exploit nonparametric rank-based correlation coefficient estimators, including Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. In high dimensional settings, we prove that the nonparanormal skeptic achieves the optimal parametric rate of convergence in both graph and parameter estimation. This celebrating result suggests that the Gaussian copula graphical models can be used as a safe replacement of the popular Gaussian graphical models, even when the data are truly Gaussian. Besides theoretical analysis, we also conduct thorough numerical simulations to compare different estimators for their graph recovery performance under both ideal and noisy settings. The proposed methods are then applied on a large-scale genomic dataset to illustrate their empirical usefulness. The R language software package huge implementing the proposed methods is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran. r-project.org/."}
{"text": "  High-dimensional tensors or multi-way data are becoming prevalent in areas such as biomedical imaging, chemometrics, networking and bibliometrics. Traditional approaches to finding lower dimensional representations of tensor data include flattening the data and applying matrix factorizations such as principal components analysis (PCA) or employing tensor decompositions such as the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions. The former can lose important structure in the data, while the latter Higher-Order PCA (HOPCA) methods can be problematic in high-dimensions with many irrelevant features. We introduce frameworks for sparse tensor factorizations or Sparse HOPCA based on heuristic algorithmic approaches and by solving penalized optimization problems related to the CP decomposition. Extensions of these approaches lead to methods for general regularized tensor factorizations, multi-way Functional HOPCA and generalizations of HOPCA for structured data. We illustrate the utility of our methods for dimension reduction, feature selection, and signal recovery on simulated data and multi-dimensional microarrays and functional MRIs."}
{"text": "  We study upper and lower bounds on the sample-complexity of learning near-optimal behaviour in finite-state discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). For the upper bound we make the assumption that each action leads to at most two possible next-states and prove a new bound for a UCRL-style algorithm on the number of time-steps when it is not Probably Approximately Correct (PAC). The new lower bound strengthens previous work by being both more general (it applies to all policies) and tighter. The upper and lower bounds match up to logarithmic factors."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we provide new theoretical results on the generalization properties of learning algorithms for multiclass classification problems. The originality of our work is that we propose to use the confusion matrix of a classifier as a measure of its quality; our contribution is in the line of work which attempts to set up and study the statistical properties of new evaluation measures such as, e.g. ROC curves. In the confusion-based learning framework we propose, we claim that a targetted objective is to minimize the size of the confusion matrix C, measured through its operator norm ||C||. We derive generalization bounds on the (size of the) confusion matrix in an extended framework of uniform stability, adapted to the case of matrix valued loss. Pivotal to our study is a very recent matrix concentration inequality that generalizes McDiarmid's inequality. As an illustration of the relevance of our theoretical results, we show how two SVM learning procedures can be proved to be confusion-friendly. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first that focuses on the confusion matrix from a theoretical point of view."}
{"text": "  Properties of data are frequently seen to vary depending on the sampled situations, which usually changes along a time evolution or owing to environmental effects. One way to analyze such data is to find invariances, or representative features kept constant over changes. The aim of this paper is to identify one such feature, namely interactions or dependencies among variables that are common across multiple datasets collected under different conditions. To that end, we propose a common substructure learning (CSSL) framework based on a graphical Gaussian model. We further present a simple learning algorithm based on the Dual Augmented Lagrangian and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. We confirm the performance of CSSL over other existing techniques in finding unchanging dependency structures in multiple datasets through numerical simulations on synthetic data and through a real world application to anomaly detection in automobile sensors."}

Here we propose a classifier which can differentiate patients having benign and malignant cancer cells. To improve the accuracy of classification, we propose to determine the optimal size of the training set and perform feature selection. To find the optimal size of the training set, different sizes of training sets are experimented and the one with highest classification rate is selected. The optimal features are selected through their F-Scores."}
{"text": "  In several application domains, high-dimensional observations are collected and then analysed in search for naturally occurring data clusters which might provide further insights about the nature of the problem. In this paper we describe a new approach for partitioning such high-dimensional data. Our assumption is that, within each cluster, the data can be approximated well by a linear subspace estimated by means of a principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed algorithm, Predictive Subspace Clustering (PSC) partitions the data into clusters while simultaneously estimating cluster-wise PCA parameters. The algorithm minimises an objective function that depends upon a new measure of influence for PCA models. A penalised version of the algorithm is also described for carrying our simultaneous subspace clustering and variable selection. The convergence of PSC is discussed in detail, and extensive simulation results and comparisons to competing methods are presented. The comparative performance of PSC has been assessed on six real gene expression data sets for which PSC often provides state-of-art results."}
{"text": "  We present an alternating augmented Lagrangian method for convex optimization problems where the cost function is the sum of two terms, one that is separable in the variable blocks, and a second that is separable in the difference between consecutive variable blocks. Examples of such problems include Fused Lasso estimation, total variation denoising, and multi-period portfolio optimization with transaction costs. In each iteration of our method, the first step involves separately optimizing over each variable block, which can be carried out in parallel. The second step is not separable in the variables, but can be carried out very efficiently. We apply the algorithm to segmentation of data based on changes inmean (l_1 mean filtering) or changes in variance (l_1 variance filtering). In a numerical example, we show that our implementation is around 10000 times faster compared with the generic optimization solver SDPT3."}
{"text": "  This work explores the effects of relevant and irrelevant boolean variables on the accuracy of classifiers. The analysis uses the assumption that the variables are conditionally independent given the class, and focuses on a natural family of learning algorithms for such sources when the relevant variables have a small advantage over random guessing. The main result is that algorithms relying predominately on irrelevant variables have error probabilities that quickly go to 0 in situations where algorithms that limit the use of irrelevant variables have errors bounded below by a positive constant. We also show that accurate learning is possible even when there are so few examples that one cannot determine with high confidence whether or not any individual variable is relevant."}
{"text": "  Now-a-days the amount of data stored in educational database increasing rapidly. These databases contain hidden information for improvement of students' performance. Educational data mining is used to study the data available in the educational field and bring out the hidden knowledge from it.

This prediction will help to identify the weak students and help them to score better marks. The C4.5, ID3 and CART decision tree algorithms are applied on engineering student's data to predict their performance in the final exam. The outcome of the decision tree predicted the number of students who are likely to pass, fail or promoted to next year. The results provide steps to improve the performance of the students who were predicted to fail or promoted. After the declaration of the results in the final examination the marks obtained by the students are fed into the system and the results were analyzed for the next session.

{"text": "  Regularized kernel methods such as, e.g., support vector machines and least-squares support vector regression constitute an important class of standard learning algorithms in machine learning. Theoretical investigations concerning asymptotic properties have manly focused on rates of convergence during the last years but there are only very few and limited (asymptotic) results on statistical inference so far. As this is a serious limitation for their use in mathematical statistics, the goal of the article is to fill this gap. Based on asymptotic normality of many of these methods, the article derives a strongly consistent estimator for the unknown covariance matrix of the limiting normal distribution. In this way, we obtain asymptotically correct confidence sets for $\\psi(f_{P,\\lambda_0})$ where $f_{P,\\lambda_0}$ denotes the minimizer of the regularized risk in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ and $\\psi:H\\rightarrow\\mathds{R}^m$ is any Hadamard-differentiable functional. Applications include (multivariate) pointwise confidence sets for values of $f_{P,\\lambda_0}$ and confidence sets for gradients, integrals, and norms."}
{"text": "  We investigate adaptive mixture methods that linearly combine outputs of $m$ constituent filters running in parallel to model a desired signal. We use \"Bregman divergences\" and obtain certain multiplicative updates to train the linear combination weights under an affine constraint or without any constraints. We use unnormalized relative entropy and relative entropy to define two different Bregman divergences that produce an unnormalized exponentiated gradient update and a normalized exponentiated gradient update on the mixture weights, respectively. We then carry out the mean and the mean-square transient analysis of these adaptive algorithms when they are used to combine outputs of $m$ constituent filters. We illustrate the accuracy of our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of these updates for sparse mixture systems."}
{"text": "  The past century was era of linear systems. Either systems (especially industrial ones) were simple (quasi)linear or linear approximations were accurate enough. In addition, just at the ending decades of the century profusion of computing devices were available, before then due to lack of computational resources it was not easy to evaluate available nonlinear system studies. At the moment both these two conditions changed, systems are highly complex and also pervasive amount of computation strength is cheap and easy to achieve. For recent era, a new branch of supervised learning well known as surrogate modeling (meta-modeling, surface modeling) has been devised which aimed at answering new needs of modeling realm. This short literature survey is on to introduce surrogate modeling to whom is familiar with the concepts of supervised learning. Necessity, challenges and visions of the topic are considered."}

{"text": "  Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is an approach to average over alternative models; yet, it usually gets excessively concentrated around the single most probable model, therefore achieving only sub-optimal classification performance. The compression-based approach (Boulle, 2007) overcomes this problem, averaging over the different models by applying a logarithmic smoothing over the models' posterior probabilities. This approach has shown excellent performances when applied to ensembles of naive Bayes classifiers. AODE is another ensemble of models with high performance (Webb, 2005), based on a collection of non-naive classifiers (called SPODE) whose probabilistic predictions are aggregated by simple arithmetic mean. Aggregating the SPODEs via BMA rather than by arithmetic mean deteriorates the performance; instead, we aggregate the SPODEs via the compression coefficients and we show that the resulting classifier obtains a slight but consistent improvement over AODE. However, an important issue in any Bayesian ensemble of models is the arbitrariness in the choice of the prior over the models. We address this problem by the paradigm of credal classification, namely by substituting the unique prior with a set of priors. Credal classifier automatically recognize the prior-dependent instances, namely the instances whose most probable class varies, when different priors are considered; in these cases, credal classifiers remain reliable by returning a set of classes rather than a single class. We thus develop the credal version of both the BMA-based and the compression-based ensemble of SPODEs, substituting the single prior over the models by a set of priors. Experiments show that both credal classifiers provide higher classification reliability than their determinate counterparts; moreover the compression-based credal classifier compares favorably to previous credal classifiers."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new discriminant analysis method (Empirical Discriminant Analysis or EDA) for binary classification in machine learning. Given a dataset of feature vectors, this method defines an empirical feature map transforming the training and test data into new data with components having Gaussian empirical distributions. This map is an empirical version of the Gaussian copula used in probability and mathematical finance. The purpose is to form a feature mapped dataset as close as possible to Gaussian, after which standard quadratic discriminants can be used for classification. We discuss this method in general, and apply it to some datasets in computational biology."}

{"text": "  Existing methods for sparse channel estimation typically provide an estimate computed as the solution maximizing an objective function defined as the sum of the log-likelihood function and a penalization term proportional to the l1-norm of the parameter of interest. However, other penalization terms have proven to have strong sparsity-inducing properties. In this work, we design pilot-assisted channel estimators for OFDM wireless receivers within the framework of sparse Bayesian learning by defining hierarchical Bayesian prior models that lead to sparsity-inducing penalization terms. The estimators result as an application of the variational message-passing algorithm on the factor graph representing the signal model extended with the hierarchical prior models. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our channel estimators as compared to traditional and state-of-the-art sparse methods."}
{"text": "  We consider to learn a causal ordering of variables in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model called LiNGAM. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But, the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions actually are violated. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data."}
{"text": "  Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their use of hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditional class probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherence functions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hinge function. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropy principle and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hinge function and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of the coherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, and the limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of the expected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence function in large-margin classification as C-learning, and we present efficient coordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized ${\\cal C}$-learning models."}
{"text": "  Probabilistic generative modeling of data distributions can potentially exploit hidden information which is useful for discriminative classification. This observation has motivated the development of approaches that couple generative and discriminative models for classification. In this paper, we propose a new approach to couple generative and discriminative models in an unified framework based on PAC-Bayes risk theory. We first derive the model-parameter-independent stochastic feature mapping from a practical MAP classifier operating on generative models. Then we construct a linear stochastic classifier equipped with the feature mapping, and derive the explicit PAC-Bayes risk bounds for such classifier for both supervised and semi-supervised learning. Minimizing the risk bound, using an EM-like iterative procedure, results in a new posterior over hidden variables (E-step) and the update rules of model parameters (M-step). The derivation of the posterior is always feasible due to the way of equipping feature mapping and the explicit form of bounding risk. The derived posterior allows the tuning of generative models and subsequently the feature mappings for better classification. The derived update rules of the model parameters are same to those of the uncoupled models as the feature mapping is model-parameter-independent. Our experiments show that the coupling between data modeling generative model and the discriminative classifier via a stochastic feature mapping in this framework leads to a general classification tool with state-of-the-art performance."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of learning a set from random samples. We show how relevant geometric and topological properties of a set can be studied analytically using concepts from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A new kind of reproducing kernel, that we call separating kernel, plays a crucial role in our study and is analyzed in detail. We prove a new analytic characterization of the support of a distribution, that naturally leads to a family of provably consistent regularized learning algorithms and we discuss the stability of these methods with respect to random sampling. Numerical experiments show that the approach is competitive, and often better, than other state of the art techniques."}

{"text": "  In this paper, we study statistical properties of semi-supervised learning, which is considered as an important problem in the community of machine learning. In the standard supervised learning, only the labeled data is observed. The classification and regression problems are formalized as the supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is also obtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data is important to improve the prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. This problems is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data. Under the the discriminative probabilistic models, it had been considered that the unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy. Recently, it was revealed that the weighted estimator using the unlabeled data achieves better prediction accuracy in comparison to the learning method using only labeled data, especially when the discriminative probabilistic model is misspecified. That is, the improvement under the semiparametric model with missing data is possible, when the semiparametric model is misspecified. In this paper, we apply the density-ratio estimator to obtain the weight function in the semi-supervised learning. The benefit of our approach is that the proposed estimator does not require well-specified probabilistic models for the probability of the unlabeled data. Based on the statistical asymptotic theory, we prove that the estimation accuracy of our method outperforms the supervised learning using only labeled data. Some numerical experiments present the usefulness of our methods."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we define such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. These properties lead us to EM algorithms for Bayesian sparse learning. We show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively re-weighted $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_1$ methods. In addition, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression."}

Our method is based on the computation of the consistency of the example base. We carried out a case study in the domain of geomatic in order to evaluate the sets of measures used to characterise geographic objects. The case study shows that our method allows to give relevant evaluations of measure sets."}
{"text": "  We present an new sequential Monte Carlo sampler for coalescent based Bayesian hierarchical clustering. Our model is appropriate for modeling non-i.i.d. data and offers a substantial reduction of computational cost when compared to the original sampler without resorting to approximations. We also propose a quadratic complexity approximation that in practice shows almost no loss in performance compared to its counterpart. We show that as a byproduct of our formulation, we obtain a greedy algorithm that exhibits performance improvement over other greedy algorithms, particularly in small data sets. In order to exploit the correlation structure of the data, we describe how to incorporate Gaussian process priors in the model as a flexible way to model non-i.i.d. data. Results on artificial and real data show significant improvements over closely related approaches."}
{"text": "  We consider the structure learning problem for graphical models that we call loosely connected Markov random fields, in which the number of short paths between any pair of nodes is small, and present a new conditional independence test based algorithm for learning the underlying graph structure. The novel maximization step in our algorithm ensures that the true edges are detected correctly even when there are short cycles in the graph. The number of samples required by our algorithm is C*log p, where p is the size of the graph and the constant C depends on the parameters of the model. We show that several previously studied models are examples of loosely connected Markov random fields, and our algorithm achieves the same or lower computational complexity than the previously designed algorithms for individual cases. We also get new results for more general graphical models, in particular, our algorithm learns general Ising models on the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(p, c/p) correctly with running time O(np^5)."}
{"text": "  Many studies on the cost-sensitive learning assumed that a unique cost matrix is known for a problem. However, this assumption may not hold for many real-world problems. For example, a classifier might need to be applied in several circumstances, each of which associates with a different cost matrix. Or, different human experts have different opinions about the costs for a given problem. Motivated by these facts, this study aims to seek the minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices. In summary, we theoretically proved that, no matter how many cost matrices are involved, the minimax problem can be tackled by solving a number of standard cost-sensitive problems and sub-problems that involve only two cost matrices. As a result, a general framework for achieving minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices is suggested and justified by preliminary empirical studies."}
{"text": "  Multiple instance learning (MIL) has attracted great attention recently in machine learning community. However, most MIL algorithms are very slow and cannot be applied to large datasets. In this paper, we propose a greedy strategy to speed up the multiple instance learning process. Our contribution is two fold. First, we propose a density ratio model, and show that maximizing a density ratio function is the low bound of the DD model under certain conditions. Secondly, we make use of a histogram ratio between positive bags and negative bags to represent the density ratio function and find codebooks separately for positive bags and negative bags by a greedy strategy. For testing, we make use of a nearest neighbor strategy to classify new bags. We test our method on both small benchmark datasets and the large TRECVID MED11 dataset. The experimental results show that our method yields comparable accuracy to the current state of the art, while being up to at least one order of magnitude faster."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of prediction for evolving graph data. We formulate the problem as the minimization of a convex objective encouraging sparsity and low-rank of the solution, that reflect natural graph properties. The convex formulation allows to obtain oracle inequalities and efficient solvers. We provide empirical results for our algorithm and comparison with competing methods, and point out two open questions related to compressed sensing and algebra of low-rank and sparse matrices."}
{"text": "  We present a converged algorithm for Tikhonov regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We specially choose this regularization because it is known that Tikhonov regularized least square (LS) is the more preferable form in solving linear inverse problems than the conventional LS. Because an NMF problem can be decomposed into LS subproblems, it can be expected that Tikhonov regularized NMF will be the more appropriate approach in solving NMF problems. The algorithm is derived using additive update rules which have been shown to have convergence guarantee. We equip the algorithm with a mechanism to automatically determine the regularization parameters based on the L-curve, a well-known concept in the inverse problems community, but is rather unknown in the NMF research. The introduction of this algorithm thus solves two inherent problems in Tikhonov regularized NMF algorithm research, i.e., convergence guarantee and regularization parameters determination."}
{"text": "  Online learning constitutes a mathematical and compelling framework to analyze sequential decision making problems in adversarial environments. The learner repeatedly chooses an action, the environment responds with an outcome, and then the learner receives a reward for the played action. The goal of the learner is to maximize his total reward. However, there are situations in which, in addition to maximizing the cumulative reward, there are some additional constraints on the sequence of decisions that must be satisfied on average by the learner. In this paper we study an extension to the online learning where the learner aims to maximize the total reward given that some additional constraints need to be satisfied. By leveraging on the theory of Lagrangian method in constrained optimization, we propose Lagrangian exponentially weighted average (LEWA) algorithm, which is a primal-dual variant of the well known exponentially weighted average algorithm, to efficiently solve constrained online decision making problems. Using novel theoretical analysis, we establish the regret and the violation of the constraint bounds in full information and bandit feedback models."}
{"text": "  Despite the widespread use of Clustering, there is distressingly little general theory of clustering available. Questions like \"What distinguishes a clustering of data from other data partitioning?\", \"Are there any principles governing all clustering paradigms?\", \"How should a user choose an appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular task?\", etc. are almost completely unanswered by the existing body of clustering literature. We consider an axiomatic approach to the theory of Clustering. We adopt the framework of Kleinberg, [Kle03]. By relaxing one of Kleinberg's clustering axioms, we sidestep his impossibility result and arrive at a consistent set of axioms. We suggest to extend these axioms, aiming to provide an axiomatic taxonomy of clustering paradigms. Such a taxonomy should provide users some guidance concerning the choice of the appropriate clustering paradigm for a given task. The main result of this paper is a set of abstract properties that characterize the Single-Linkage clustering function. This characterization result provides new insight into the properties of desired data groupings that make Single-Linkage the appropriate choice. We conclude by considering a taxonomy of clustering functions based on abstract properties that each satisfies."}
{"text": "  A quantile binary classifier uses the rule: Classify x as +1 if P(Y = 1|X = x) >= t, and as -1 otherwise, for a fixed quantile parameter t {[0, 1]. It has been shown that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the limit are quantile classifiers with t = 1/2 . In this paper, we show that by using asymmetric cost of misclassification SVMs can be appropriately extended to recover, in the limit, the quantile binary classifier for any t. We then present a principled algorithm to solve the extended SVM classifier for all values of t simultaneously. This has two implications: First, one can recover the entire conditional distribution P(Y = 1|X = x) = t for t {[0, 1]. Second, we can build a risk-agnostic SVM classifier where the cost of misclassification need not be known apriori. Preliminary numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  We consider MAP estimators for structured prediction with exponential family models. In particular, we concentrate on the case that efficient algorithms for uniform sampling from the output space exist. We show that under this assumption (i) exact computation of the partition function remains a hard problem, and (ii) the partition function and the gradient of the log partition function can be approximated efficiently. Our main result is an approximation scheme for the partition function based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo theory. We also show that the efficient uniform sampling assumption holds in several application settings that are of importance in machine learning."}
{"text": "  We provide an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret rate in an unknown weakly communicating Markov Decision Process (MDP). The algorithm proceeds in episodes where, in each episode, it picks a policy using regularization based on the span of the optimal bias vector. For an MDP with S states and A actions whose optimal bias vector has span bounded by H, we show a regret bound of ~O(HSpAT). We also relate the span to various diameter-like quantities associated with the MDP, demonstrating how our results improve on previous regret bounds."}
{"text": "  We present a modular approach to reinforcement learning that uses a Bayesian representation of the uncertainty over models. The approach, BOSS (Best of Sampled Set), drives exploration by sampling multiple models from the posterior and selecting actions optimistically. It extends previous work by providing a rule for deciding when to resample and how to combine the models. We show that our algorithm achieves nearoptimal reward with high probability with a sample complexity that is low relative to the speed at which the posterior distribution converges during learning. We demonstrate that BOSS performs quite favorably compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches and illustrate its flexibility by pairing it with a non-parametric model that generalizes across states."}
{"text": "  We consider a multi-armed bandit problem where the decision maker can explore and exploit different arms at every round. The exploited arm adds to the decision maker's cumulative reward (without necessarily observing the reward) while the explored arm reveals its value. We devise algorithms for this setup and show that the dependence on the number of arms, k, can be much better than the standard square root of k dependence, depending on the behavior of the arms' reward sequences. For the important case of piecewise stationary stochastic bandits, we show a significant improvement over existing algorithms. Our algorithms are based on a non-uniform sampling policy, which we show is essential to the success of any algorithm in the adversarial setup. Finally, we show some simulation results on an ultra-wide band channel selection inspired setting indicating the applicability of our algorithms."}
{"text": "  Hierarchical parametric models consisting of observable and latent variables are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. For example, a mixture model is a representative hierarchical model for clustering. From the statistical point of view, the models can be regular or singular due to the distribution of data. In the regular case, the models have the identifiability; there is one-to-one relation between a probability density function for the model expression and the parameter. The Fisher information matrix is positive definite, and the estimation accuracy of both observable and latent variables has been studied. In the singular case, on the other hand, the models are not identifiable and the Fisher matrix is not positive definite. Conventional statistical analysis based on the inverse Fisher matrix is not applicable. Recently, an algebraic geometrical analysis has been developed and is used to elucidate the Bayes estimation of observable variables. The present paper applies this analysis to latent-variable estimation and determines its theoretical performance. Our results clarify behavior of the convergence of the posterior distribution. It is found that the posterior of the observable-variable estimation can be different from the one in the latent-variable estimation. Because of the difference, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on the parameter and the latent variable cannot construct the desired posterior distribution."}
{"text": "  We are concerned with the issue of how to calculate the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) code-length. There is a problem that the normalization term of the NML code-length may diverge when it is continuous and unbounded and a straightforward computation of it is highly expensive when the data domain is finite . In previous works it has been investigated how to calculate the NML code-length for specific types of distributions. We first propose a general method for computing the NML code-length for the exponential family. Then we specifically focus on Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and propose a new efficient method for computing the NML to them. We develop it by generalizing Rissanen's re-normalizing technique. Then we apply this method to the clustering issue, in which a clustering structure is modeled using a GMM, and the main task is to estimate the optimal number of clusters on the basis of the NML code-length. We demonstrate using artificial data sets the superiority of the NML-based clustering over other criteria such as AIC, BIC in terms of the data size required for high accuracy rate to be achieved."}
{"text": "  This paper describes the method of visualization of periodic constituents and instability areas in series of measurements, being based on the algorithm of smoothing out and concept of one-dimensional cellular automata. A method can be used at the analysis of temporal series, related to the volumes of thematic publications in web-space."}
{"text": "  We introduce into the classical perceptron algorithm with margin a mechanism that shrinks the current weight vector as a first step of the update. If the shrinking factor is constant the resulting algorithm may be regarded as a margin-error-driven version of NORMA with constant learning rate. In this case we show that the allowed strength of shrinking depends on the value of the maximum margin. We also consider variable shrinking factors for which there is no such dependence. In both cases we obtain new generalizations of the perceptron with margin able to provably attain in a finite number of steps any desirable approximation of the maximal margin hyperplane. The new approximate maximum margin classifiers appear experimentally to be very competitive in 2-norm soft margin tasks involving linear kernels."}
{"text": "  In environments with uncertain dynamics exploration is necessary to learn how to perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong exploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The essence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other state by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration algorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited before. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems would break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most physical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we address the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We first propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that imposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed safe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed safe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization formulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the guaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our framework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration methods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a Martian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore better than classical exploration methods."}
{"text": "  This paper presents the first actor-critic algorithm for off-policy reinforcement learning. Our algorithm is online and incremental, and its per-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights. Previous work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy setting and does not take advantage of the recent advances in off-policy gradient temporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable a target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another (behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are more practical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly represent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a large action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine the generality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibility in action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental, linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces, prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms, and empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms on standard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems."}
{"text": "  We theoretically analyze and compare the following five popular multiclass classification methods: One vs. All, All Pairs, Tree-based classifiers, Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) with randomly generated code matrices, and Multiclass SVM. In the first four methods, the classification is based on a reduction to binary classification. We consider the case where the binary classifier comes from a class of VC dimension $d$, and in particular from the class of halfspaces over $\\reals^d$. We analyze both the estimation error and the approximation error of these methods. Our analysis reveals interesting conclusions of practical relevance, regarding the success of the different approaches under various conditions. Our proof technique employs tools from VC theory to analyze the \\emph{approximation error} of hypothesis classes. This is in sharp contrast to most, if not all, previous uses of VC theory, which only deal with estimation error."}
{"text": "  Unsupervised models can provide supplementary soft constraints to help classify new, \"target\" data since similar instances in the target set are more likely to share the same class label. Such models can also help detect possible differences between training and target distributions, which is useful in applications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learning settings. This paper describes a general optimization framework that takes as input class membership estimates from existing classifiers learnt on previously encountered \"source\" data, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the target data. This framework admits a wide range of loss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties of Bregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principled and scalable approach. A variety of experiments show that the proposed framework can yield results substantially superior to those provided by popular transductive learning techniques or by naively applying classifiers learnt on the original task to the target data."}
{"text": "  Numerous data mining techniques have been developed to extract information and identify patterns and predict trends from large data sets. In this study, two classification techniques, the J48 implementation of the C4.5 algorithm and a Naive Bayes classifier are applied to predict lung cancer survivability from an extensive data set with fifteen years of patient records. The purpose of the project is to verify the predictive effectiveness of the two techniques on real, historical data. Besides the performance outcome that renders J48 marginally better than the Naive Bayes technique, there is a detailed description of the data and the required pre-processing activities. The performance results confirm expectations while some of the issues that appeared during experimentation, underscore the value of having domain-specific understanding to leverage any domain-specific characteristics inherent in the data."}
{"text": "  The CSA-ES is an Evolution Strategy with Cumulative Step size Adaptation, where the step size is adapted measuring the length of a so-called cumulative path. The cumulative path is a combination of the previous steps realized by the algorithm, where the importance of each step decreases with time. This article studies the CSA-ES on composites of strictly increasing with affine linear functions through the investigation of its underlying Markov chains. Rigorous results on the change and the variation of the step size are derived with and without cumulation. The step-size diverges geometrically fast in most cases. Furthermore, the influence of the cumulation parameter is studied."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the problem of robust subspace recovery: given a set of $N$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, if many lie in a $d$-dimensional subspace, then can we recover the underlying subspace? We show that Tyler's M-estimator can be used to recover the underlying subspace, if the percentage of the inliers is larger than $d/D$ and the data points lie in general position. Empirically, Tyler's M-estimator compares favorably with other convex subspace recovery algorithms in both simulations and experiments on real data sets."}
{"text": "  A mixture of Gaussians fit to a single curved or heavy-tailed cluster will report that the data contains many clusters. To produce more appropriate clusterings, we introduce a model which warps a latent mixture of Gaussians to produce nonparametric cluster shapes. The possibly low-dimensional latent mixture model allows us to summarize the properties of the high-dimensional clusters (or density manifolds) describing the data. The number of manifolds, as well as the shape and dimension of each manifold is automatically inferred. We derive a simple inference scheme for this model which analytically integrates out both the mixture parameters and the warping function. We show that our model is effective for density estimation, performs better than infinite Gaussian mixture models at recovering the true number of clusters, and produces interpretable summaries of high-dimensional datasets."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a novel communication-efficient parallel belief propagation (CE-PBP) algorithm for training latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Based on the synchronous belief propagation (BP) algorithm, we first develop a parallel belief propagation (PBP) algorithm on the parallel architecture. Because the extensive communication delay often causes a low efficiency of parallel topic modeling, we further use Zipf's law to reduce the total communication cost in PBP. Extensive experiments on different data sets demonstrate that CE-PBP achieves a higher topic modeling accuracy and reduces more than 80% communication cost than the state-of-the-art parallel Gibbs sampling (PGS) algorithm."}
{"text": "  We consider a multi-armed bandit setting that is inspired by real-world applications in e-commerce. In our setting, there are a few types of users, each with a specific response to the different arms. When a user enters the system, his type is unknown to the decision maker. The decision maker can either treat each user separately ignoring the previously observed users, or can attempt to take advantage of knowing that only few types exist and cluster the users according to their response to the arms. We devise algorithms that combine the usual exploration-exploitation tradeoff with clustering of users and demonstrate the value of clustering. In the process of developing algorithms for the clustered setting, we propose and analyze simple algorithms for the setup where a decision maker knows that a user belongs to one of few types, but does not know which one."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a new Soft Confidence-Weighted (SCW) online learning scheme, which enables the conventional confidence-weighted learning method to handle non-separable cases. Unlike the previous confidence-weighted learning algorithms, the proposed soft confidence-weighted learning method enjoys all the four salient properties: (i) large margin training, (ii) confidence weighting, (iii) capability to handle non-separable data, and (iv) adaptive margin. Our experimental results show that the proposed SCW algorithms significantly outperform the original CW algorithm. When comparing with a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms (including AROW, NAROW and NHERD), we found that SCW generally achieves better or at least comparable predictive accuracy, but enjoys significant advantage of computational efficiency (i.e., smaller number of updates and lower time cost)."}
{"text": "  Low-rank matrix decomposition has gained great popularity recently in scaling up kernel methods to large amounts of data. However, some limitations could prevent them from working effectively in certain domains. For example, many existing approaches are intrinsically unsupervised, which does not incorporate side information (e.g., class labels) to produce task specific decompositions; also, they typically work \"transductively\", i.e., the factorization does not generalize to new samples, so the complete factorization needs to be recomputed when new samples become available. To solve these problems, in this paper we propose an\"inductive\"-flavored method for low-rank kernel decomposition with priors. We achieve this by generalizing the Nystr\\\"om method in a novel way. On the one hand, our approach employs a highly flexible, nonparametric structure that allows us to generalize the low-rank factors to arbitrarily new samples; on the other hand, it has linear time and space complexities, which can be orders of magnitudes faster than existing approaches and renders great efficiency in learning a low-rank kernel decomposition. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  There has been a recent focus in reinforcement learning on addressing continuous state and action problems by optimizing parameterized policies. PI2 is a recent example of this approach. It combines a derivation from first principles of stochastic optimal control with tools from statistical estimation theory. In this paper, we consider PI2 as a member of the wider family of methods which share the concept of probability-weighted averaging to iteratively update parameters to optimize a cost function. We compare PI2 to other members of the same family - Cross-Entropy Methods and CMAES - at the conceptual level and in terms of performance. The comparison suggests the derivation of a novel algorithm which we call PI2-CMA for \"Path Integral Policy Improvement with Covariance Matrix Adaptation\". PI2-CMA's main advantage is that it determines the magnitude of the exploration noise automatically."}
{"text": "  F-measures are popular performance metrics, particularly for tasks with imbalanced data sets. Algorithms for learning to maximize F-measures follow two approaches: the empirical utility maximization (EUM) approach learns a classifier having optimal performance on training data, while the decision-theoretic approach learns a probabilistic model and then predicts labels with maximum expected F-measure. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical justifications and connections for these two approaches, and we study the conditions under which one approach is preferable to the other using synthetic and real datasets. Given accurate models, our results suggest that the two approaches are asymptotically equivalent given large training and test sets. Nevertheless, empirically, the EUM approach appears to be more robust against model misspecification, and given a good model, the decision-theoretic approach appears to be better for handling rare classes and a common domain adaptation scenario."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of multiple kernel learning from noisy labels. This is in contrast to most of the previous studies on multiple kernel learning that mainly focus on developing efficient algorithms and assume perfectly labeled training examples. Directly applying the existing multiple kernel learning algorithms to noisily labeled examples often leads to suboptimal performance due to the incorrect class assignments. We address this challenge by casting multiple kernel learning from noisy labels into a stochastic programming problem, and presenting a minimax formulation. We develop an efficient algorithm for solving the related convex-concave optimization problem with a fast convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ where $T$ is the number of iterations. Empirical studies on UCI data sets verify both the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithm."}
{"text": "  Structured prediction is the cornerstone of several machine learning applications. Unfortunately, in structured prediction settings with expressive inter-variable interactions, exact inference-based learning algorithms, e.g. Structural SVM, are often intractable. We present a new way, Decomposed Learning (DecL), which performs efficient learning by restricting the inference step to a limited part of the structured spaces. We provide characterizations based on the structure, target parameters, and gold labels, under which DecL is equivalent to exact learning. We then show that in real world settings, where our theoretical assumptions may not completely hold, DecL-based algorithms are significantly more efficient and as accurate as exact learning."}
{"text": "  Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning manifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space, and discuss when two-manifold problems are useful. Finally, we demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data."}
{"text": "  We propose a new, nonparametric approach to learning and representing transition dynamics in Markov decision processes (MDPs), which can be combined easily with dynamic programming methods for policy optimisation and value estimation. This approach makes use of a recently developed representation of conditional distributions as \\emph{embeddings} in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Such representations bypass the need for estimating transition probabilities or densities, and apply to any domain on which kernels can be defined. This avoids the need to calculate intractable integrals, since expectations are represented as RKHS inner products whose computation has linear complexity in the number of points used to represent the embedding. We provide guarantees for the proposed applications in MDPs: in the context of a value iteration algorithm, we prove convergence to either the optimal policy, or to the closest projection of the optimal policy in our model class (an RKHS), under reasonable assumptions. In experiments, we investigate a learning task in a typical classical control setting (the under-actuated pendulum), and on a navigation problem where only images from a sensor are observed. For policy optimisation we compare with least-squares policy iteration where a Gaussian process is used for value function estimation. For value estimation we also compare to the NPDP method. Our approach achieves better performance in all experiments."}
{"text": "  We propose a new learning method for heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA), in which the data from the source domain and the target domain are represented by heterogeneous features with different dimensions. Using two different projection matrices, we first transform the data from two domains into a common subspace in order to measure the similarity between the data from two domains. We then propose two new feature mapping functions to augment the transformed data with their original features and zeros. The existing learning methods (e.g., SVM and SVR) can be readily incorporated with our newly proposed augmented feature representations to effectively utilize the data from both domains for HDA. Using the hinge loss function in SVM as an example, we introduce the detailed objective function in our method called Heterogeneous Feature Augmentation (HFA) for a linear case and also describe its kernelization in order to efficiently cope with the data with very high dimensions. Moreover, we also develop an alternating optimization algorithm to effectively solve the nontrivial optimization problem in our HFA method. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate that HFA outperforms the existing HDA methods."}
{"text": "  Stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAs) have been successfully used to learn new representations for domain adaptation. Recently, they have attained record accuracy on standard benchmark tasks of sentiment analysis across different text domains. SDAs learn robust data representations by reconstruction, recovering original features from data that are artificially corrupted with noise. In this paper, we propose marginalized SDA (mSDA) that addresses two crucial limitations of SDAs: high computational cost and lack of scalability to high-dimensional features. In contrast to SDAs, our approach of mSDA marginalizes noise and thus does not require stochastic gradient descent or other optimization algorithms to learn parameters ? in fact, they are computed in closed-form. Consequently, mSDA, which can be implemented in only 20 lines of MATLAB^{TM}, significantly speeds up SDAs by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the representations learnt by mSDA are as effective as the traditional SDAs, attaining almost identical accuracies in benchmark tasks."}
{"text": "  We consider a dynamic pricing problem under unknown demand models. In this problem a seller offers prices to a stream of customers and observes either success or failure in each sale attempt. The underlying demand model is unknown to the seller and can take one of N possible forms. In this paper, we show that this problem can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit with dependent arms. We propose a dynamic pricing policy based on the likelihood ratio test. We show that the proposed policy achieves complete learning, i.e., it offers a bounded regret where regret is defined as the revenue loss with respect to the case with a known demand model. This is in sharp contrast with the logarithmic growing regret in multi-armed bandit with independent arms."}
{"text": "  Learning algorithms related to artificial neural networks and in particular for Deep Learning may seem to involve many bells and whistles, called hyper-parameters. This chapter is meant as a practical guide with recommendations for some of the most commonly used hyper-parameters, in particular in the context of learning algorithms based on back-propagated gradient and gradient-based optimization. It also discusses how to deal with the fact that more interesting results can be obtained when allowing one to adjust many hyper-parameters. Overall, it describes elements of the practice used to successfully and efficiently train and debug large-scale and often deep multi-layer neural networks. It closes with open questions about the training difficulties observed with deeper architectures."}
{"text": "  The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning."}
{"text": "  In this paper we consider the problem of collectively classifying entities where relational information is available across the entities. In practice inaccurate class distribution for each entity is often available from another (external) classifier. For example this distribution could come from a classifier built using content features or a simple dictionary. Given the relational and inaccurate external classifier information, we consider two graph based settings in which the problem of collective classification can be solved. In the first setting the class distribution is used to fix labels to a subset of nodes and the labels for the remaining nodes are obtained like in a transductive setting. In the other setting the class distributions of all nodes are used to define the fitting function part of a graph regularized objective function. We define a generalized objective function that handles both the settings. Methods like harmonic Gaussian field and local-global consistency (LGC) reported in the literature can be seen as special cases. We extend the LGC and weighted vote relational neighbor classification (WvRN) methods to support usage of external classifier information. We also propose an efficient least squares regularization (LSR) based method and relate it to information regularization methods. All the methods are evaluated on several benchmark and real world datasets. Considering together speed, robustness and accuracy, experimental results indicate that the LSR and WvRN-extension methods perform better than other methods."}
{"text": "  Metric learning methods have been shown to perform well on different learning tasks. Many of them rely on target neighborhood relationships that are computed in the original feature space and remain fixed throughout learning. As a result, the learned metric reflects the original neighborhood relations. We propose a novel formulation of the metric learning problem in which, in addition to the metric, the target neighborhood relations are also learned in a two-step iterative approach. The new formulation can be seen as a generalization of many existing metric learning methods. The formulation includes a target neighbor assignment rule that assigns different numbers of neighbors to instances according to their quality; `high quality' instances get more neighbors. We experiment with two of its instantiations that correspond to the metric learning algorithms LMNN and MCML and compare it to other metric learning methods on a number of datasets. The experimental results show state-of-the-art performance and provide evidence that learning the neighborhood relations does improve predictive performance."}
{"text": "  We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-confidence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show O(T^{1/2} log T) regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-confidence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance."}
{"text": "  Semi-supervised template update systems allow to automatically take into account the intra-class variability of the biometric data over time. Such systems can be inefficient by including too many impostor's samples or skipping too many genuine's samples. In the first case, the biometric reference drifts from the real biometric data and attracts more often impostors. In the second case, the biometric reference does not evolve quickly enough and also progressively drifts from the real biometric data. We propose a hybrid system using several biometric sub-references in order to increase per- formance of self-update systems by reducing the previously cited errors. The proposition is validated for a keystroke- dynamics authentication system (this modality suffers of high variability over time) on two consequent datasets from the state of the art."}
{"text": "  Most keystroke dynamics studies have been evaluated using a specific kind of dataset in which users type an imposed login and password. Moreover, these studies are optimistics since most of them use different acquisition protocols, private datasets, controlled environment, etc. In order to enhance the accuracy of keystroke dynamics' performance, the main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a new kind of dataset in which users have typed both an imposed and a chosen pairs of logins and passwords. In addition, the keystroke dynamics samples are collected in a web-based uncontrolled environment (OS, keyboards, browser, etc.). Such kind of dataset is important since it provides us more realistic results of keystroke dynamics' performance in comparison to the literature (controlled environment, etc.). Second, we present a statistical analysis of well known assertions such as the relationship between performance and password size, impact of fusion schemes on system overall performance, and others such as the relationship between performance and entropy. We put into obviousness in this paper some new results on keystroke dynamics in realistic conditions."}
{"text": "  We compute the expected value of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to various fundamental statistical models with respect to canonical priors on the probability simplex. We obtain closed formulas for the expected model approximation errors, depending on the dimension of the models and the cardinalities of their sample spaces. For the uniform prior, the expected divergence from any model containing the uniform distribution is bounded by a constant $1-\\gamma$, and for the models that we consider, this bound is approached if the state space is very large and the models' dimension does not grow too fast. For Dirichlet priors the expected divergence is bounded in a similar way, if the concentration parameters take reasonable values. These results serve as reference values for more complicated statistical models."}
{"text": "  We consider probabilistic multinomial probit classification using Gaussian process (GP) priors. The challenges with the multiclass GP classification are the integration over the non-Gaussian posterior distribution, and the increase of the number of unknown latent variables as the number of target classes grows. Expectation propagation (EP) has proven to be a very accurate method for approximate inference but the existing EP approaches for the multinomial probit GP classification rely on numerical quadratures or independence assumptions between the latent values from different classes to facilitate the computations. In this paper, we propose a novel nested EP approach which does not require numerical quadratures, and approximates accurately all between-class posterior dependencies of the latent values, but still scales linearly in the number of classes. The predictive accuracy of the nested EP approach is compared to Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximations with various benchmark data sets. In the experiments nested EP was the most consistent method with respect to MCMC sampling, but the differences between the compared methods were small if only the classification accuracy is concerned."}
{"text": "  The selection of the best classification algorithm for a given dataset is a very widespread problem. It is also a complex one, in the sense it requires to make several important methodological choices. Among them, in this work we focus on the measure used to assess the classification performance and rank the algorithms. We present the most popular measures and discuss their properties. Despite the numerous measures proposed over the years, many of them turn out to be equivalent in this specific case, to have interpretation problems, or to be unsuitable for our purpose. Consequently, classic overall success rate or marginal rates should be preferred for this specific task."}
{"text": "  It has previously been hypothesized, and supported with some experimental evidence, that deeper representations, when well trained, tend to do a better job at disentangling the underlying factors of variation. We study the following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better disentangling, can be exploited to produce faster-mixing Markov chains. Consequently, mixing would be more efficient at higher levels of representation. To better understand why and how this is happening, we propose a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing and interpolating between samples."}
{"text": "  Case vs control comparisons have been the classical approach to the study of neurological diseases. However, most patients will not fall cleanly into either group. Instead, clinicians will typically find patients that cannot be classified as having clearly progressed into the disease state. For those subjects, very little can be said about their brain function on the basis of analyses of group differences. To describe the intermediate brain function requires models that interpolate between the disease states. We have chosen Gaussian Processes (GP) regression to obtain a continuous spectrum of brain activation and to extract the unknown disease progression profile. Our models incorporate spatial distribution of measures of activation, e.g. the correlation of an fMRI trace with an input stimulus, and so constitute ultra-high multi-variate GP regressors. We applied GPs to model fMRI image phenotypes across Alzheimer's Disease (AD) behavioural measures, e.g. MMSE, ACE etc. scores, and obtained predictions at non-observed MMSE/ACE values. The overall model confirmed the known reduction in the spatial extent of activity in response to reading versus false-font stimulation. The predictive uncertainty indicated the worsening confidence intervals at behavioural scores distance from those used for GP training. Thus, the model indicated the type of patient (what behavioural score) that would need to included in the training data to improve models predictions."}
{"text": "  Recently, sparsity-based algorithms are proposed for super-resolution spectrum estimation. However, to achieve adequately high resolution in real-world signal analysis, the dictionary atoms have to be close to each other in frequency, thereby resulting in a coherent design. The popular convex compressed sensing methods break down in presence of high coherence and large noise. We propose a new regularization approach to handle model collinearity and obtain parsimonious frequency selection simultaneously. It takes advantage of the pairing structure of sine and cosine atoms in the frequency dictionary. A probabilistic spectrum screening is also developed for fast computation in high dimensions. A data-resampling version of high-dimensional Bayesian Information Criterion is used to determine the regularization parameters. Experiments show the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms in challenging situations with small sample size, high frequency resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratio."}
{"text": "  Electronic health records contain rich textual data which possess critical predictive information for machine-learning based diagnostic aids. However many traditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate both vector space data and text. We present a supervised method using Laplacian eigenmaps to augment existing machine-learning methods with low-dimensional representations of textual predictors which preserve the local similarities. The proposed implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient descent. For the evaluation we applied our method to over 2,000 patient records from a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients were diagnosed with cardiac disease. Our method was compared with latent semantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant analysis. The results were assessed using AUC, MCC, specificity, and sensitivity. Results indicate supervised Laplacian eigenmaps was the highest performing method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC respectively. SLE showed an increase in 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the baseline which excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and MCC respectively over unsupervised Laplacian eigenmaps. This method allows many existing machine learning predictors to effectively and efficiently utilize the potential of textual predictors."}
{"text": "  This paper focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) with limited prior knowledge. In the domain of swarm robotics for instance, the expert can hardly design a reward function or demonstrate the target behavior, forbidding the use of both standard RL and inverse reinforcement learning. Although with a limited expertise, the human expert is still often able to emit preferences and rank the agent demonstrations. Earlier work has presented an iterative preference-based RL framework: expert preferences are exploited to learn an approximate policy return, thus enabling the agent to achieve direct policy search. Iteratively, the agent selects a new candidate policy and demonstrates it; the expert ranks the new demonstration comparatively to the previous best one; the expert's ranking feedback enables the agent to refine the approximate policy return, and the process is iterated. In this paper, preference-based reinforcement learning is combined with active ranking in order to decrease the number of ranking queries to the expert needed to yield a satisfactory policy. Experiments on the mountain car and the cancer treatment testbeds witness that a couple of dozen rankings enable to learn a competent policy."}
{"text": "  The real challenge in pattern recognition task and machine learning process is to train a discriminator using labeled data and use it to distinguish between future data as accurate as possible. However, most of the problems in the real world have numerous data, which labeling them is a cumbersome or even an impossible matter. Semi-supervised learning is one approach to overcome these types of problems. It uses only a small set of labeled with the company of huge remain and unlabeled data to train the discriminator. In semi-supervised learning, it is very essential that which data is labeled and depend on position of data it effectiveness changes. In this paper, we proposed an evolutionary approach called Artificial Immune System (AIS) to determine which data is better to be labeled to get the high quality data. The experimental results represent the effectiveness of this algorithm in finding these data points."}
{"text": "  It is often the case that, within an online recommender system, multiple users share a common account. Can such shared accounts be identified solely on the basis of the user- provided ratings? Once a shared account is identified, can the different users sharing it be identified as well? Whenever such user identification is feasible, it opens the way to possible improvements in personalized recommendations, but also raises privacy concerns. We develop a model for composite accounts based on unions of linear subspaces, and use subspace clustering for carrying out the identification task. We show that a significant fraction of such accounts is identifiable in a reliable manner, and illustrate potential uses for personalized recommendation."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we attempts to learn a single metric across two heterogeneous domains where source domain is fully labeled and has many samples while target domain has only a few labeled samples but abundant unlabeled samples. To the best of our knowledge, this task is seldom touched. The proposed learning model has a simple underlying motivation: all the samples in both the source and the target domains are mapped into a common space, where both their priors P(sample)s and their posteriors P(label|sample)s are forced to be respectively aligned as much as possible. We show that the two mappings, from both the source domain and the target domain to the common space, can be reparameterized into a single positive semi-definite(PSD) matrix. Then we develop an efficient Bregman Projection algorithm to optimize the PDS matrix over which a LogDet function is used to regularize. Furthermore, we also show that this model can be easily kernelized and verify its effectiveness in crosslanguage retrieval task and cross-domain object recognition task."}
{"text": "  Schapire's margin theory provides a theoretical explanation to the success of boosting-type methods and manifests that a good margin distribution (MD) of training samples is essential for generalization. However the statement that a MD is good is vague, consequently, many recently developed algorithms try to generate a MD in their goodness senses for boosting generalization. Unlike their indirect control over MD, in this paper, we propose an alternative boosting algorithm termed Margin distribution Controlled Boosting (MCBoost) which directly controls the MD by introducing and optimizing a key adjustable margin parameter. MCBoost's optimization implementation adopts the column generation technique to ensure fast convergence and small number of weak classifiers involved in the final MCBooster. We empirically demonstrate: 1) AdaBoost is actually also a MD controlled algorithm and its iteration number acts as a parameter controlling the distribution and 2) the generalization performance of MCBoost evaluated on UCI benchmark datasets is validated better than those of AdaBoost, L2Boost, LPBoost, AdaBoost-CG and MDBoost."}
{"text": "  We present new algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL, or inverse optimal control) in convex optimization settings. We argue that finite-space IRL can be posed as a convex quadratic program under a Bayesian inference framework with the objective of maximum a posterior estimation. To deal with problems in large or even infinite state space, we propose a Gaussian process model and use preference graphs to represent observations of decision trajectories. Our method is distinguished from other approaches to IRL in that it makes no assumptions about the form of the reward function and yet it retains the promise of computationally manageable implementations for potential real-world applications. In comparison with an establish algorithm on small-scale numerical problems, our method demonstrated better accuracy in apprenticeship learning and a more robust dependence on the number of observations."}
{"text": "  We study pool-based active learning of half-spaces. We revisit the aggressive approach for active learning in the realizable case, and show that it can be made efficient and practical, while also having theoretical guarantees under reasonable assumptions. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it can be preferable to mellow approaches. Our efficient aggressive active learner of half-spaces has formal approximation guarantees that hold when the pool is separable with a margin. While our analysis is focused on the realizable setting, we show that a simple heuristic allows using the same algorithm successfully for pools with low error as well. We further compare the aggressive approach to the mellow approach, and prove that there are cases in which the aggressive approach results in significantly better label complexity compared to the mellow approach. We demonstrate experimentally that substantial improvements in label complexity can be achieved using the aggressive approach, for both realizable and low-error settings."}
{"text": "  Many different machine learning algorithms exist; taking into account each algorithm's hyperparameters, there is a staggeringly large number of possible alternatives overall. We consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous work that addresses these issues in isolation. We show that this problem can be addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection/hyperparameter optimization methods. We hope that our approach will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved performance."}
{"text": "  A very important topic in systems biology is developing statistical methods that automatically find causal relations in gene regulatory networks with no prior knowledge of causal connectivity. Many methods have been developed for time series data. However, discovery methods based on steady-state data are often necessary and preferable since obtaining time series data can be more expensive and/or infeasible for many biological systems. A conventional approach is causal Bayesian networks. However, estimation of Bayesian networks is ill-posed. In many cases it cannot uniquely identify the underlying causal network and only gives a large class of equivalent causal networks that cannot be distinguished between based on the data distribution. We propose a new discovery algorithm for uniquely identifying the underlying causal network of genes. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first algorithm for learning gene networks based on a fully identifiable causal model called LiNGAM. We here compare our algorithm with competing algorithms using artificially-generated data, although it is definitely better to test it based on real microarray gene expression data."}
{"text": "  A single, stationary topic model such as latent Dirichlet allocation is inappropriate for modeling corpora that span long time periods, as the popularity of topics is likely to change over time. A number of models that incorporate time have been proposed, but in general they either exhibit limited forms of temporal variation, or require computationally expensive inference methods. In this paper we propose non-parametric Topics over Time (npTOT), a model for time-varying topics that allows an unbounded number of topics and exible distribution over the temporal variations in those topics' popularity. We develop a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the proposed model and compare against existing models on synthetic and real document sets."}
{"text": "  Scientists study trajectory data to understand trends in movement patterns, such as human mobility for traffic analysis and urban planning. There is a pressing need for scalable and efficient techniques for analyzing this data and discovering the underlying patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique which we call vector-field $k$-means.   The central idea of our approach is to use vector fields to induce a similarity notion between trajectories. Other clustering algorithms seek a representative trajectory that best describes each cluster, much like $k$-means identifies a representative \"center\" for each cluster. Vector-field $k$-means, on the other hand, recognizes that in all but the simplest examples, no single trajectory adequately describes a cluster. Our approach is based on the premise that movement trends in trajectory data can be modeled as flows within multiple vector fields, and the vector field itself is what defines each of the clusters. We also show how vector-field $k$-means connects techniques for scalar field design on meshes and $k$-means clustering.   We present an algorithm that finds a locally optimal clustering of trajectories into vector fields, and demonstrate how vector-field $k$-means can be used to mine patterns from trajectory data. We present experimental evidence of its effectiveness and efficiency using several datasets, including historical hurricane data, GPS tracks of people and vehicles, and anonymous call records from a large phone company. We compare our results to previous trajectory clustering techniques, and find that our algorithm performs faster in practice than the current state-of-the-art in trajectory clustering, in some examples by a large margin."}
{"text": "  This study deals with the missing link prediction problem: the problem of predicting the existence of missing connections between entities of interest. We address link prediction using coupled analysis of relational datasets represented as heterogeneous data, i.e., datasets in the form of matrices and higher-order tensors. We propose to use an approach based on probabilistic interpretation of tensor factorisation models, i.e., Generalised Coupled Tensor Factorisation, which can simultaneously fit a large class of tensor models to higher-order tensors/matrices with com- mon latent factors using different loss functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that joint analysis of data from multiple sources via coupled factorisation improves the link prediction performance and the selection of right loss function and tensor model is crucial for accurately predicting missing links."}
{"text": "  Maximum Variance Unfolding is one of the main methods for (nonlinear) dimensionality reduction. We study its large sample limit, providing specific rates of convergence under standard assumptions.

{"text": "  Given two graphs, the graph matching problem is to align the two vertex sets so as to minimize the number of adjacency disagreements between the two graphs. The seeded graph matching problem is the graph matching problem when we are first given a partial alignment that we are tasked with completing. In this paper, we modify the state-of-the-art approximate graph matching algorithm \"FAQ\" of Vogelstein et al. (2015) to make it a fast approximate seeded graph matching algorithm, adapt its applicability to include graphs with differently sized vertex sets, and extend the algorithm so as to provide, for each individual vertex, a nomination list of likely matches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via simulation and real data experiments; indeed, knowledge of even a few seeds can be extremely effective when our seeded graph matching algorithm is used to recover a naturally existing alignment that is only partially observed."}
{"text": "  The k-means algorithm is one of the well-known and most popular clustering algorithms. K-means seeks an optimal partition of the data by minimizing the sum of squared error with an iterative optimization procedure, which belongs to the category of hill climbing algorithms. As we know hill climbing searches are famous for converging to local optimums. Since k-means can converge to a local optimum, different initial points generally lead to different convergence cancroids, which makes it important to start with a reasonable initial partition in order to achieve high quality clustering solutions. However, in theory, there exist no efficient and universal methods for determining such initial partitions. In this paper we tried to find an optimum initial partitioning for k-means algorithm. To achieve this goal we proposed a new improved version of downhill simplex search, and then we used it in order to find an optimal result for clustering approach and then compare this algorithm with Genetic Algorithm base (GA), Genetic K-Means (GKM), Improved Genetic K-Means (IGKM) and k-means algorithms."}
{"text": "  Feature selection is one of the most prominent learning tasks, especially in high-dimensional datasets in which the goal is to understand the mechanisms that underly the learning dataset. However most of them typically deliver just a flat set of relevant features and provide no further information on what kind of structures, e.g. feature groupings, might underly the set of relevant features. In this paper we propose a new learning paradigm in which our goal is to uncover the structures that underly the set of relevant features for a given learning problem. We uncover two types of features sets, non-replaceable features that contain important information about the target variable and cannot be replaced by other features, and functionally similar features sets that can be used interchangeably in learned models, given the presence of the non-replaceable features, with no change in the predictive performance. To do so we propose a new learning algorithm that learns a number of disjoint models using a model disjointness regularization constraint together with a constraint on the predictive agreement of the disjoint models. We explore the behavior of our approach on a number of high-dimensional datasets, and show that, as expected by their construction, these satisfy a number of properties. Namely, model disjointness, a high predictive agreement, and a similar predictive performance to models learned on the full set of relevant features. The ability to structure the set of relevant features in such a manner can become a valuable tool in different applications of scientific knowledge discovery."}
{"text": "  Cost-sensitive learning relies on the availability of a known and fixed cost matrix. However, in some scenarios, the cost matrix is uncertain during training, and re-train a classifier after the cost matrix is specified would not be an option. For binary classification, this issue can be successfully addressed by methods maximizing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric. Since the AUC can measure performance of base classifiers independent of cost during training, and a larger AUC is more likely to lead to a smaller total cost in testing using the threshold moving method. As an extension of AUC to multi-class problems, MAUC has attracted lots of attentions and been widely used. Although MAUC also measures performance of base classifiers independent of cost, it is unclear whether a larger MAUC of classifiers is more likely to lead to a smaller total cost. In fact, it is also unclear what kinds of post-processing methods should be used in multi-class problems to convert base classifiers into discrete classifiers such that the total cost is as small as possible. In the paper, we empirically explore the relationship between MAUC and the total cost of classifiers by applying two categories of post-processing methods. Our results suggest that a larger MAUC is also beneficial. Interestingly, simple calibration methods that convert the output matrix into posterior probabilities perform better than existing sophisticated post re-optimization methods."}
{"text": "  We offer a novel view of AdaBoost in a statistical setting. We propose a Bayesian model for binary classification in which label noise is modeled hierarchically. Using variational inference to optimize a dynamic evidence lower bound, we derive a new boosting-like algorithm called VIBoost.

{"text": "  In this paper, naive Bayesian and C4.5 Decision Tree Classifiers(DTC) are successively applied on materials informatics to classify the engineering materials into different classes for the selection of materials that suit the input design specifications. Here, the classifiers are analyzed individually and their performance evaluation is analyzed with confusion matrix predictive parameters and standard measures, the classification results are analyzed on different class of materials. Comparison of classifiers has found that naive Bayesian classifier is more accurate and better than the C4.5 DTC. The knowledge discovered by the naive bayesian classifier can be employed for decision making in materials selection in manufacturing industries."}
{"text": "  Conformal predictors are set predictors that are automatically valid in the sense of having coverage probability equal to or exceeding a given confidence level. Inductive conformal predictors are a computationally efficient version of conformal predictors satisfying the same property of validity.

This paper explores various versions of conditional validity and various ways to achieve them using inductive conformal predictors and their modifications."}
{"text": "  This paper investigates energy efficiency for two-tier femtocell networks through combining game theory and stochastic learning. With the Stackelberg game formulation, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework is applied to study the joint average utility maximization of macrocells and femtocells subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio requirements. The macrocells behave as the leaders and the femtocells are followers during the learning procedure. At each time step, the leaders commit to dynamic strategies based on the best responses of the followers, while the followers compete against each other with no further information but the leaders' strategy information. In this paper, we propose two learning algorithms to schedule each cell's stochastic power levels, leading by the macrocells. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed studies and show that the two learning algorithms substantially improve the energy efficiency of the femtocell networks."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of learning local metrics for nearest neighbor classification. Most previous works on local metric learning learn a number of local unrelated metrics. While this \"independence\" approach delivers an increased flexibility its downside is the considerable risk of overfitting. We present a new parametric local metric learning method in which we learn a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. Using an approximation error bound of the metric matrix function we learn local metrics as linear combinations of basis metrics defined on anchor points over different regions of the instance space. We constrain the metric matrix function by imposing on the linear combinations manifold regularization which makes the learned metric matrix function vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold. Our metric learning method has excellent performance both in terms of predictive power and scalability. We experimented with several large-scale classification problems, tens of thousands of instances, and compared it with several state of the art metric learning methods, both global and local, as well as to SVM with automatic kernel selection, all of which it outperforms in a significant manner."}
{"text": "  In the paper, we consider the problem of link prediction in time-evolving graphs. We assume that certain graph features, such as the node degree, follow a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and we propose to use this information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Our strategy involves a joint optimization procedure over the space of adjacency matrices and VAR matrices which takes into account both sparsity and low rank properties of the matrices. Oracle inequalities are derived and illustrate the trade-offs in the choice of smoothing parameters when modeling the joint effect of sparsity and low rank property. The estimate is computed efficiently using proximal methods through a generalized forward-backward agorithm."}
{"text": "  We consider the problems of detection and localization of a contiguous block of weak activation in a large matrix, from a small number of noisy, possibly adaptive, compressive (linear) measurements. This is closely related to the problem of compressed sensing, where the task is to estimate a sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements. Contrary to results in compressed sensing, where it has been shown that neither adaptivity nor contiguous structure help much, we show that for reliable localization the magnitude of the weakest signals is strongly influenced by both structure and the ability to choose measurements adaptively while for detection neither adaptivity nor structure reduce the requirement on the magnitude of the signal. We characterize the precise tradeoffs between the various problem parameters, the signal strength and the number of measurements required to reliably detect and localize the block of activation. The sufficient conditions are complemented with information theoretic lower bounds."}
{"text": "  Exact Gaussian Process (GP) regression has O(N^3) runtime for data size N, making it intractable for large N. Many algorithms for improving GP scaling approximate the covariance with lower rank matrices. Other work has exploited structure inherent in particular covariance functions, including GPs with implied Markov structure, and equispaced inputs (both enable O(N) runtime). However, these GP advances have not been extended to the multidimensional input setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional applications. This paper introduces and tests novel extensions of structured GPs to multidimensional inputs. We present new methods for additive GPs, showing a novel connection between the classic backfitting method and the Bayesian framework. To achieve optimal accuracy-complexity tradeoff, we extend this model with a novel variant of projection pursuit regression. Our primary result -- projection pursuit Gaussian Process Regression -- shows orders of magnitude speedup while preserving high accuracy. The natural second and third steps include non-Gaussian observations and higher dimensional equispaced grid methods. We introduce novel techniques to address both of these necessary directions. We thoroughly illustrate the power of these three advances on several datasets, achieving close performance to the naive Full GP at orders of magnitude less cost."}
{"text": "  Mean-field variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-field methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest---like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression---are nonconjuate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression."}
{"text": "  Time series classification is a field which has drawn much attention over the past decade. A new approach for classification of time series uses classification trees based on shapelets. A shapelet is a subsequence extracted from one of the time series in the dataset. A disadvantage of this approach is the time required for building the shapelet-based classification tree. The search for the best shapelet requires examining all subsequences of all lengths from all time series in the training set.   A key goal of this work was to find an evaluation order of the shapelets space which enables fast convergence to an accurate model. The comparative analysis we conducted clearly indicates that a random evaluation order yields the best results. Our empirical analysis of the distribution of high-quality shapelets within the shapelets space provides insights into why randomized shapelets sampling is superior to alternative evaluation orders.   We present an algorithm for randomized model generation for shapelet-based classification that converges extremely quickly to a model with surprisingly high accuracy after evaluating only an exceedingly small fraction of the shapelets space."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present a new adaptive feature scaling scheme for ultrahigh-dimensional feature selection on Big Data. To solve this problem effectively, we first reformulate it as a convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem and then propose an efficient \\emph{feature generating paradigm}. In contrast with traditional gradient-based approaches that conduct optimization on all input features, the proposed method iteratively activates a group of features and solves a sequence of multiple kernel learning (MKL) subproblems of much reduced scale. To further speed up the training, we propose to solve the MKL subproblems in their primal forms through a modified accelerated proximal gradient approach. Due to such an optimization scheme, some efficient cache techniques are also developed. The feature generating paradigm can guarantee that the solution converges globally under mild conditions and achieve lower feature selection bias. Moreover, the proposed method can tackle two challenging tasks in feature selection: 1) group-based feature selection with complex structures and 2) nonlinear feature selection with explicit feature mappings. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets containing tens of million data points with $O(10^{14})$ features demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of generalization performance and training efficiency."}
{"text": "  In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We formulate the recommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal probability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be predicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the BP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each active user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As opposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving the recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset), we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of the users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to the state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision accuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems."}
{"text": "  Typical cohorts in brain imaging studies are not large enough for systematic testing of all the information contained in the images. To build testable working hypotheses, investigators thus rely on analysis of previous work, sometimes formalized in a so-called meta-analysis. In brain imaging, this approach underlies the specification of regions of interest (ROIs) that are usually selected on the basis of the coordinates of previously detected effects. In this paper, we propose to use a database of images, rather than coordinates, and frame the problem as transfer learning: learning a discriminant model on a reference task to apply it to a different but related new task. To facilitate statistical analysis of small cohorts, we use a sparse discriminant model that selects predictive voxels on the reference task and thus provides a principled procedure to define ROIs. The benefits of our approach are twofold. First it uses the reference database for prediction, i.e. to provide potential biomarkers in a clinical setting. Second it increases statistical power on the new task. We demonstrate on a set of 18 pairs of functional MRI experimental conditions that our approach gives good prediction. In addition, on a specific transfer situation involving different scanners at different locations, we show that voxel selection based on transfer learning leads to higher detection power on small cohorts."}

{"text": "  We analyze an online learning algorithm that adaptively combines outputs of two constituent algorithms (or the experts) running in parallel to model an unknown desired signal. This online learning algorithm is shown to achieve (and in some cases outperform) the mean-square error (MSE) performance of the best constituent algorithm in the mixture in the steady-state. However, the MSE analysis of this algorithm in the literature uses approximations and relies on statistical models on the underlying signals and systems. Hence, such an analysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real life systems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and, in many cases, that are even chaotic. In this paper, we produce results in an individual sequence manner. In particular, we relate the time-accumulated squared estimation error of this online algorithm at any time over any interval to the time accumulated squared estimation error of the optimal convex mixture of the constituent algorithms directly tuned to the underlying signal in a deterministic sense without any statistical assumptions. In this sense, our analysis provides the transient, steady-state and tracking behavior of this algorithm in a strong sense without any approximations in the derivations or statistical assumptions on the underlying signals such that our results are guaranteed to hold. We illustrate the introduced results through examples."}
{"text": "  We investigate online kernel algorithms which simultaneously process multiple classification tasks while a fixed constraint is imposed on the size of their active sets. We focus in particular on the design of algorithms that can efficiently deal with problems where the number of tasks is extremely high and the task data are large scale. Two new projection-based algorithms are introduced to efficiently tackle those issues while presenting different trade offs on how the available memory is managed with respect to the prior information about the learning tasks. Theoretically sound budget algorithms are devised by coupling the Randomized Budget Perceptron and the Forgetron algorithms with the multitask kernel. We show how the two seemingly contrasting properties of learning from multiple tasks and keeping a constant memory footprint can be balanced, and how the sharing of the available space among different tasks is automatically taken care of. We propose and discuss new insights on the multitask kernel. Experiments show that online kernel multitask algorithms running on a budget can efficiently tackle real world learning problems involving multiple tasks."}
{"text": "  We introduce semi-supervised data classification algorithms based on total variation (TV), Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), support vector machine (SVM), Cheeger cut, labeled and unlabeled data points. We design binary and multi-class semi-supervised classification algorithms. We compare the TV-based classification algorithms with the related Laplacian-based algorithms, and show that TV classification perform significantly better when the number of labeled data is small."}
{"text": "  Many applications in data analysis rely on the decomposition of a data matrix into a low-rank and a sparse component. Existing methods that tackle this task use the nuclear norm and L1-cost functions as convex relaxations of the rank constraint and the sparsity measure, respectively, or employ thresholding techniques. We propose a method that allows for reconstructing and tracking a subspace of upper-bounded dimension from incomplete and corrupted observations. It does not require any a priori information about the number of outliers. The core of our algorithm is an intrinsic Conjugate Gradient method on the set of orthogonal projection matrices, the so-called Grassmannian. Non-convex sparsity measures are used for outlier detection, which leads to improved performance in terms of robustly recovering and tracking the low-rank matrix. In particular, our approach can cope with more outliers and with an underlying matrix of higher rank than other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can compute the maximum-likelihood (ML) or maximum a posterior (MAP) point estimate of the mixture models or latent variable models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which has been one of the most popular probabilistic topic modeling methods in the past decade. However, batch EM has high time and space complexities to learn big LDA models from big data streams. In this paper, we present a fast online EM (FOEM) algorithm that infers the topic distribution from the previously unseen documents incrementally with constant memory requirements. Within the stochastic approximation framework, we show that FOEM can converge to the local stationary point of the LDA's likelihood function. By dynamic scheduling for the fast speed and parameter streaming for the low memory usage, FOEM is more efficient for some lifelong topic modeling tasks than the state-of-the-art online LDA algorithms to handle both big data and big models (aka, big topic modeling) on just a PC."}
{"text": "  In this paper we derive an efficient algorithm to learn the parameters of structured predictors in general graphical models. This algorithm blends the learning and inference tasks, which results in a significant speedup over traditional approaches, such as conditional random fields and structured support vector machines. For this purpose we utilize the structures of the predictors to describe a low dimensional structured prediction task which encourages local consistencies within the different structures while learning the parameters of the model. Convexity of the learning task provides the means to enforce the consistencies between the different parts. The inference-learning blending algorithm that we propose is guaranteed to converge to the optimum of the low dimensional primal and dual programs. Unlike many of the existing approaches, the inference-learning blending allows us to learn efficiently high-order graphical models, over regions of any size, and very large number of parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, while presenting state-of-the-art results in stereo estimation, semantic segmentation, shape reconstruction, and indoor scene understanding."}
{"text": "  Graph clustering involves the task of dividing nodes into clusters, so that the edge density is higher within clusters as opposed to across clusters. A natural, classic and popular statistical setting for evaluating solutions to this problem is the stochastic block model, also referred to as the planted partition model.   In this paper we present a new algorithm--a convexified version of Maximum Likelihood--for graph clustering. We show that, in the classic stochastic block model setting, it outperforms existing methods by polynomial factors when the cluster size is allowed to have general scalings. In fact, it is within logarithmic factors of known lower bounds for spectral methods, and there is evidence suggesting that no polynomial time algorithm would do significantly better.   We then show that this guarantee carries over to a more general extension of the stochastic block model. Our method can handle the settings of semi-random graphs, heterogeneous degree distributions, unequal cluster sizes, unaffiliated nodes, partially observed graphs and planted clique/coloring etc. In particular, our results provide the best exact recovery guarantees to date for the planted partition, planted k-disjoint-cliques and planted noisy coloring models with general cluster sizes; in other settings, we match the best existing results up to logarithmic factors."}
{"text": "  Boosting methods combine a set of moderately accurate weaklearners to form a highly accurate predictor. Despite the practical importance of multi-class boosting, it has received far less attention than its binary counterpart. In this work, we propose a fully-corrective multi-class boosting formulation which directly solves the multi-class problem without dividing it into multiple binary classification problems. In contrast, most previous multi-class boosting algorithms decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple binary boosting problems. By explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the primal optimization problem, we are able to construct a column generation-based fully-corrective approach to boosting which directly optimizes multi-class classification performance. The new approach not only updates all weak learners' coefficients at every iteration, but does so in a manner flexible enough to accommodate various loss functions and regularizations. For example, it enables us to introduce structural sparsity through mixed-norm regularization to promote group sparsity and feature sharing. Boosting with shared features is particularly beneficial in complex prediction problems where features can be expensive to compute. Our experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our direct multi-class boosting generalizes as well as, or better than, a range of competing multi-class boosting methods. The end result is a highly effective and compact ensemble classifier which can be trained in a distributed fashion."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a differentiable function given a finite number of evaluations to the function. We construct a sampling scheme that samples more often in regions where the function oscillates more, while allocating the samples such that they are well spread on the domain (this notion shares similitude with low discrepancy). We prove that the estimate returned by the algorithm is almost similarly accurate as the estimate that an optimal oracle strategy (that would know the variations of the function everywhere) would return, and provide a finite-sample analysis."}
{"text": "  We consider continuous-time sparse stochastic processes from which we have only a finite number of noisy/noiseless samples. Our goal is to estimate the noiseless samples (denoising) and the signal in-between (interpolation problem).   By relying on tools from the theory of splines, we derive the joint a priori distribution of the samples and show how this probability density function can be factorized. The factorization enables us to tractably implement the maximum a posteriori and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criteria as two statistical approaches for estimating the unknowns. We compare the derived statistical methods with well-known techniques for the recovery of sparse signals, such as the $\\ell_1$ norm and Log ($\\ell_1$-$\\ell_0$ relaxation) regularization methods. The simulation results show that, under certain conditions, the performance of the regularization techniques can be very close to that of the MMSE estimator."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the general scenario of resource sharing in a decentralized system when the resource rewards/qualities are time-varying and unknown to the users, and using the same resource by multiple users leads to reduced quality due to resource sharing. Firstly, we consider a user-independent reward model with no communication between the users, where a user gets feedback about the congestion level in the resource it uses. Secondly, we consider user-specific rewards and allow costly communication between the users. The users have a cooperative goal of achieving the highest system utility. There are multiple obstacles in achieving this goal such as the decentralized nature of the system, unknown resource qualities, communication, computation and switching costs. We propose distributed learning algorithms with logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal allocation. Our logarithmic regret result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian reward models, as well as under communication, computation and switching costs."}
{"text": "  Multi-task sparse feature learning aims to improve the generalization performance by exploiting the shared features among tasks. It has been successfully applied to many applications including computer vision and biomedical informatics. Most of the existing multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms are formulated as a convex sparse regularization problem, which is usually suboptimal, due to its looseness for approximating an $\\ell_0$-type regularizer. In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation for multi-task sparse feature learning based on a novel non-convex regularizer. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning (MSMTFL) algorithm; we also provide intuitive interpretations, detailed convergence and reproducibility analysis for the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we present a detailed theoretical analysis showing that MSMTFL achieves a better parameter estimation error bound than the convex formulation. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMTFL in comparison with the state of the art multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms."}

This method is sensitive to the density of the distribution and offers some solution to the so called chaining effect. We also define a modified version, $SL^*(\\alpha)$, to treat the chaining through points or small blocks. We study the theoretical properties of these methods and offer some theoretical background for the treatment of chaining effects."}
{"text": "  This work concerns a comparison of SVM kernel methods in text categorization tasks. In particular I define a kernel function that estimates the similarity between two objects computing by their compressed lengths. In fact, compression algorithms can detect arbitrarily long dependencies within the text strings. Data text vectorization looses information in feature extractions and is highly sensitive by textual language. Furthermore, these methods are language independent and require no text preprocessing. Moreover, the accuracy computed on the datasets (Web-KB, 20ng and Reuters-21578), in some case, is greater than Gaussian, linear and polynomial kernels. The method limits are represented by computational time complexity of the Gram matrix and by very poor performance on non-textual datasets."}
{"text": "  Many real world network problems often concern multivariate nodal attributes such as image, textual, and multi-view feature vectors on nodes, rather than simple univariate nodal attributes. The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating graphs from multi-attribute data. Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features. Computationally, we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure. Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under various conditions. Furthermore, we provide illustrative applications to uncovering gene regulatory networks from gene and protein profiles, and uncovering brain connectivity graph from functional magnetic resonance imaging data."}
{"text": "  Given a time series of graphs G(t) = (V, E(t)), t = 1, 2, ..., where the fixed vertex set V represents \"actors\" and an edge between vertex u and vertex v at time t (uv \\in E(t)) represents the existence of a communications event between actors u and v during the tth time period, we wish to detect anomalies and/or change points. We consider a collection of graph features, or invariants, and demonstrate that adaptive fusion provides superior inferential efficacy compared to naive equal weighting for a certain class of anomaly detection problems. Simulation results using a latent process model for time series of graphs, as well as illustrative experimental results for a time series of graphs derived from the Enron email data, show that a fusion statistic can provide superior inference compared to individual invariants alone. These results also demonstrate that an adaptive weighting scheme for fusion of invariants performs better than naive equal weighting."}
{"text": "  Transductive SVM (TSVM) is a well known semi-supervised large margin learning method for binary text classification. In this paper we extend this method to multi-class and hierarchical classification problems. We point out that the determination of labels of unlabeled examples with fixed classifier weights is a linear programming problem. We devise an efficient technique for solving it. The method is applicable to general loss functions. We demonstrate the value of the new method using large margin loss on a number of multi-class and hierarchical classification datasets. For maxent loss we show empirically that our method is better than expectation regularization/constraint and posterior regularization methods, and competitive with the version of entropy regularization method which uses label constraints."}
{"text": "  We study the mixtures of factorizing probability distributions represented as visible marginal distributions in stochastic layered networks. We take the perspective of kernel transitions of distributions, which gives a unified picture of distributed representations arising from Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and other networks without lateral connections. We describe combinatorial and geometric properties of the set of kernels and products of kernels realizable by DBNs as the network parameters vary. We describe explicit classes of probability distributions, including exponential families, that can be learned by DBNs. We use these submodels to bound the maximal and the expected Kullback-Leibler approximation errors of DBNs from above depending on the number of hidden layers and units that they contain."}
{"text": "  We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a fully Bayesian treatment and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as different kernels. Kernel functions have been introduced to matrix factorization to integrate side information about the rows and columns (e.g., objects and users in recommender systems), which is necessary for making out-of-matrix (i.e., cold start) predictions. We discuss specifically bipartite graph inference, where the output matrix is binary, but extensions to more general matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A fully conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization problem enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas fully Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning that additionally reveals which side information sources are informative. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. We then show that our framework can also be used for solving multilabel learning problems by considering samples and labels as the two domains where matrix factorization operates on. Our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming loss values on 10 out of 14 multilabel classification data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for piecewise linear regression which can learn continuous as well as discontinuous piecewise linear functions. The main idea is to repeatedly partition the data and learn a liner model in in each partition. While a simple algorithm incorporating this idea does not work well, an interesting modification results in a good algorithm. The proposed algorithm is similar in spirit to $k$-means clustering algorithm. We show that our algorithm can also be viewed as an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of parameters under a reasonable probability model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with the state of art regression learning algorithms on some real world datasets."}

{"text": "  Some of the most compelling applications of online convex optimization, including online prediction and classification, are unconstrained: the natural feasible set is R^n. Existing algorithms fail to achieve sub-linear regret in this setting unless constraints on the comparator point x^* are known in advance. We present algorithms that, without such prior knowledge, offer near-optimal regret bounds with respect to any choice of x^*. In particular, regret with respect to x^* = 0 is constant. We then prove lower bounds showing that our guarantees are near-optimal in this setting."}

The result is shown using the stationary phase approximation and standard integration techniques and requires proper ordering of limits. We highlight a relationship with the well-known characteristic function approach to density estimation, and detail why our result is distinct from this approach."}
{"text": "  Random projection has been widely used in data classification. It maps high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional subspace in order to reduce the computational cost in solving the related optimization problem. While previous studies are focused on analyzing the classification performance of using random projection, in this work, we consider the recovery problem, i.e., how to accurately recover the optimal solution to the original optimization problem in the high-dimensional space based on the solution learned from the subspace spanned by random projections. We present a simple algorithm, termed Dual Random Projection, that uses the dual solution of the low-dimensional optimization problem to recover the optimal solution to the original problem. Our theoretical analysis shows that with a high probability, the proposed algorithm is able to accurately recover the optimal solution to the original problem, provided that the data matrix is of low rank or can be well approximated by a low rank matrix."}
{"text": "  We study inference and learning based on a sparse coding model with `spike-and-slab' prior. As in standard sparse coding, the model used assumes independent latent sources that linearly combine to generate data points. However, instead of using a standard sparse prior such as a Laplace distribution, we study the application of a more flexible `spike-and-slab' distribution which models the absence or presence of a source's contribution independently of its strength if it contributes. We investigate two approaches to optimize the parameters of spike-and-slab sparse coding: a novel truncated EM approach and, for comparison, an approach based on standard factored variational distributions. The truncated approach can be regarded as a variational approach with truncated posteriors as variational distributions. In applications to source separation we find that both approaches improve the state-of-the-art in a number of standard benchmarks, which argues for the use of `spike-and-slab' priors for the corresponding data domains. Furthermore, we find that the truncated EM approach improves on the standard factored approach in source separation tasks$-$which hints to biases introduced by assuming posterior independence in the factored variational approach. Likewise, on a standard benchmark for image denoising, we find that the truncated EM approach improves on the factored variational approach. While the performance of the factored approach saturates with increasing numbers of hidden dimensions, the performance of the truncated approach improves the state-of-the-art for higher noise levels."}
{"text": "  Statistical inference on graphs is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science, engineering, business, etc. In many applications, we are faced with the reality of errorfully observed graphs. That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. We wish to perform an inference task -- the inference task considered here is \"vertex classification\". However, we do not observe $G$; rather, for each potential edge $uv \\in {{V}\\choose{2}}$ we observe an \"edge-feature\" which we use to classify $uv$ as edge/not-edge. Thus we errorfully observe $G$ when we observe the graph $\\widetilde{G} = (V,\\widetilde{E})$ as the edges in $\\widetilde{E}$ arise from the classifications of the \"edge-features\", and are expected to be errorful. Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we observe -- more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge-features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality tradeoff for a simple class of random graphs model, namely the stochastic blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for classifying $v$ and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize performance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the quantity/quality tradeoff for errorful obesrvations of the {\\it C.\\ elegans} connectome graph."}
{"text": "  Many random processes can be simulated as the output of a deterministic model accepting random inputs. Such a model usually describes a complex mathematical or physical stochastic system and the randomness is introduced in the input variables of the model. When the statistics of the output event are known, these input variables have to be chosen in a specific way for the output to have the prescribed statistics. Because the probability distribution of the input random variables is not directly known but dictated implicitly by the statistics of the output random variables, this problem is usually intractable for classical sampling methods. Based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo we propose a novel method to sample random inputs to such models by introducing a modification to the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. As an example we consider a system described by a stochastic differential equation (sde) and demonstrate how sample paths of a random process satisfying this sde can be generated with our technique."}
{"text": "  There are two widely known issues with properly training Recurrent Neural Networks, the vanishing and the exploding gradient problems detailed in Bengio et al. (1994). In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical, a geometric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section."}
{"text": "  Improving students academic performance is not an easy task for the academic community of higher learning.

It is recommended that all these correlated information should be conveyed to the class teacher before the conduction of final exam.

{"text": "  In many practical applications of supervised learning the task involves the prediction of multiple target variables from a common set of input variables. When the prediction targets are binary the task is called multi-label classification, while when the targets are continuous the task is called multi-target regression. In both tasks, target variables often exhibit statistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to improve predictive accuracy is a core challenge. A family of multi-label classification methods address this challenge by building a separate model for each target on an expanded input space where other targets are treated as additional input variables. Despite the success of these methods in the multi-label classification domain, their applicability and effectiveness in multi-target regression has not been studied until now. In this paper, we introduce two new methods for multi-target regression, called Stacked Single-Target and Ensemble of Regressor Chains, by adapting two popular multi-label classification methods of this family. Furthermore, we highlight an inherent problem of these methods - a discrepancy of the values of the additional input variables between training and prediction - and develop extensions that use out-of-sample estimates of the target variables during training in order to tackle this problem. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation carried out on a large and diverse collection of datasets show that, when the discrepancy is appropriately mitigated, the proposed methods attain consistent improvements over the independent regressions baseline. Moreover, two versions of Ensemble of Regression Chains perform significantly better than four state-of-the-art methods including regularization-based multi-task learning methods and a multi-objective random forest approach."}
{"text": "  Nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process are an elegant alternative to finite models when the number of underlying components is unknown, but inference in such models can be slow. Existing attempts to parallelize inference in such models have relied on introducing approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the posterior estimate. In this paper, we describe auxiliary variable representations for the Dirichlet process and the hierarchical Dirichlet process that allow us to sample from the true posterior in a distributed manner. We show that our approach allows scalable inference without the deterioration in estimate quality that accompanies existing methods."}
{"text": "  After a more than decade-long period of relatively little research activity in the area of recurrent neural networks, several new developments will be reviewed here that have allowed substantial progress both in understanding and in technical solutions towards more efficient training of recurrent networks. These advances have been motivated by and related to the optimization issues surrounding deep learning. Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful in what they can in principle represent in terms of modelling sequences,their training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment. The experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test error."}
{"text": "  In this paper we prove the probabilistic continuous complexity conjecture. In continuous complexity theory, this states that the complexity of solving a continuous problem with probability approaching 1 converges (in this limit) to the complexity of solving the same problem in its worst case. We prove the conjecture holds if and only if space of problem elements is uniformly convex. The non-uniformly convex case has a striking counterexample in the problem of identifying a Brownian path in Wiener space, where it is shown that probabilistic complexity converges to only half of the worst case complexity in this limit."}
{"text": "  There have lately been several suggestions for parametrized distances on a graph that generalize the shortest path distance and the commute time or resistance distance. The need for developing such distances has risen from the observation that the above-mentioned common distances in many situations fail to take into account the global structure of the graph. In this article, we develop the theory of one family of graph node distances, known as the randomized shortest path dissimilarity, which has its foundation in statistical physics. We show that the randomized shortest path dissimilarity can be easily computed in closed form for all pairs of nodes of a graph. Moreover, we come up with a new definition of a distance measure that we call the free energy distance. The free energy distance can be seen as an upgrade of the randomized shortest path dissimilarity as it defines a metric, in addition to which it satisfies the graph-geodetic property. The derivation and computation of the free energy distance are also straightforward. We then make a comparison between a set of generalized distances that interpolate between the shortest path distance and the commute time, or resistance distance. This comparison focuses on the applicability of the distances in graph node clustering and classification. The comparison, in general, shows that the parametrized distances perform well in the tasks. In particular, we see that the results obtained with the free energy distance are among the best in all the experiments."}
{"text": "  Model selection is a crucial issue in machine-learning and a wide variety of penalisation methods (with possibly data dependent complexity penalties) have recently been introduced for this purpose. However their empirical performance is generally not well documented in the literature. It is the goal of this paper to investigate to which extent such recent techniques can be successfully used for the tuning of both the regularisation and kernel parameters in support vector regression (SVR) and the complexity measure in regression trees (CART). This task is traditionally solved via V-fold cross-validation (VFCV), which gives efficient results for a reasonable computational cost. A disadvantage however of VFCV is that the procedure is known to provide an asymptotically suboptimal risk estimate as the number of examples tends to infinity. Recently, a penalisation procedure called V-fold penalisation has been proposed to improve on VFCV, supported by theoretical arguments. Here we report on an extensive set of experiments comparing V-fold penalisation and VFCV for SVR/CART calibration on several benchmark datasets. We highlight cases in which VFCV and V-fold penalisation provide poor estimates of the risk respectively and introduce a modified penalisation technique to reduce the estimation error."}
{"text": "  We investigate the problem of transforming an input sequence into a high-dimensional output sequence in order to transcribe polyphonic audio music into symbolic notation. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a recurrent neural network that is able to learn realistic output distributions given the input and we devise an efficient algorithm to search for the global mode of that distribution. The resulting method produces musically plausible transcriptions even under high levels of noise and drastically outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on five datasets of synthesized sounds and real recordings, approximately halving the test error rate."}
{"text": "  The classical mixture of Gaussians model is related to K-means via small-variance asymptotics: as the covariances of the Gaussians tend to zero, the negative log-likelihood of the mixture of Gaussians model approaches the K-means objective, and the EM algorithm approaches the K-means algorithm. Kulis & Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework."}
{"text": "  In data mining applications, feature selection is an essential process since it reduces a model's complexity. The cost of obtaining the feature values must be taken into consideration in many domains. In this paper, we study the cost-sensitive feature selection problem on numerical data with measurement errors, test costs and misclassification costs. The major contributions of this paper are four-fold. First, a new data model is built to address test costs and misclassification costs as well as error boundaries. Second, a covering-based rough set with measurement errors is constructed. Given a confidence interval, the neighborhood is an ellipse in a two-dimension space, or an ellipsoidal in a three-dimension space, etc. Third, a new cost-sensitive feature selection problem is defined on this covering-based rough set. Fourth, both backtracking and heuristic algorithms are proposed to deal with this new problem. The algorithms are tested on six UCI (University of California - Irvine) data sets. Experimental results show that (1) the pruning techniques of the backtracking algorithm help reducing the number of operations significantly, and (2) the heuristic algorithm usually obtains optimal results. This study is a step toward realistic applications of cost-sensitive learning."}
{"text": "  Parsimony, including sparsity and low rank, has been shown to successfully model data in numerous machine learning and signal processing tasks. Traditionally, such modeling approaches rely on an iterative algorithm that minimizes an objective function with parsimony-promoting terms. The inherently sequential structure and data-dependent complexity and latency of iterative optimization constitute a major limitation in many applications requiring real-time performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitation encountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their inclusion in discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose to move the emphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and develop a process-centric view of parsimonious modeling, in which a learned deterministic fixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu of iterative optimization. We show a principled way to construct learnable pursuit process architectures for structured sparse and robust low rank models, derived from the iteration of proximal descent algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exact parsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the standard optimization methods. We also show that appropriate training regimes allow to naturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative settings. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on several challenging problems in image and audio processing with several orders of magnitude speedup compared to the exact optimization algorithms."}
{"text": "  We apply information-based complexity analysis to support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, with the goal of a comprehensive continuous algorithmic analysis of such algorithms. This involves complexity measures in which some higher order operations (e.g., certain optimizations) are considered primitive for the purposes of measuring complexity. We consider classes of information operators and algorithms made up of scaled families, and investigate the utility of scaling the complexities to minimize error. We look at the division of statistical learning into information and algorithmic components, at the complexities of each, and at applications to support vector machine (SVM) and more general machine learning algorithms. We give applications to SVM algorithms graded into linear and higher order components, and give an example in biomedical informatics."}
{"text": "  Problems in machine learning (ML) can involve noisy input data, and ML classification methods have reached limiting accuracies when based on standard ML data sets consisting of feature vectors and their classes. Greater accuracy will require incorporation of prior structural information on data into learning. We study methods to regularize feature vectors (unsupervised regularization methods), analogous to supervised regularization for estimating functions in ML. We study regularization (denoising) of ML feature vectors using Tikhonov and other regularization methods for functions on ${\\bf R}^n$. A feature vector ${\\bf x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\{x_q\\}_{q=1}^n$ is viewed as a function of its index $q$, and smoothed using prior information on its structure. This can involve a penalty functional on feature vectors analogous to those in statistical learning, or use of proximity (e.g. graph) structure on the set of indices. Such feature vector regularization inherits a property from function denoising on ${\\bf R}^n$, in that accuracy is non-monotonic in the denoising (regularization) parameter $\\alpha$. Under some assumptions about the noise level and the data structure, we show that the best reconstruction accuracy also occurs at a finite positive $\\alpha$ in index spaces with graph structures. We adapt two standard function denoising methods used on ${\\bf R}^n$, local averaging and kernel regression. In general the index space can be any discrete set with a notion of proximity, e.g. a metric space, a subset of ${\\bf R}^n$, or a graph/network, with feature vectors as functions with some notion of continuity. We show this improves feature vector recovery, and thus the subsequent classification or regression done on them. We give an example in gene expression analysis for cancer classification with the genome as an index space and network structure based protein-protein interactions."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present our work on clustering and prediction of temporal dynamics of global congestion configurations in large-scale road networks. Instead of looking into temporal traffic state variation of individual links, or of small areas, we focus on spatial congestion configurations of the whole network. In our work, we aim at describing the typical temporal dynamic patterns of this network-level traffic state and achieving long-term prediction of the large-scale traffic dynamics, in a unified data-mining framework. To this end, we formulate this joint task using Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF), which has been shown to be a useful decomposition tools for multivariate data sequences. Clustering and prediction are performed based on the compact tensor factorization results. Experiments on large-scale simulated data illustrate the interest of our method with promising results for long-term forecast of traffic evolution."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a new hybrid Fuzzy-ART based K-Means Clustering technique to solve the part machine grouping problem in cellular manufacturing systems considering operational time. The performance of the proposed technique is tested with problems from open literature and the results are compared to the existing clustering models such as simple K-means algorithm and modified ART1 algorithm using an efficient modified performance measure known as modified grouping efficiency (MGE) as found in the literature. The results support the better performance of the proposed algorithm. The Novelty of this study lies in the simple and efficient methodology to produce quick solutions for shop floor managers with least computational efforts and time."}
{"text": "  We present a novel per-dimension learning rate method for gradient descent called ADADELTA. The method dynamically adapts over time using only first order information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla stochastic gradient descent. The method requires no manual tuning of a learning rate and appears robust to noisy gradient information, different model architecture choices, various data modalities and selection of hyperparameters. We show promising results compared to other methods on the MNIST digit classification task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed cluster environment."}
{"text": "  One of the ultimate goals of Manifold Learning (ML) is to reconstruct an unknown nonlinear low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional observation space by a given set of data points from the manifold. We derive a local lower bound for the maximum reconstruction error in a small neighborhood of an arbitrary point. The lower bound is defined in terms of the distance between tangent spaces to the original manifold and the estimated manifold at the considered point and reconstructed point, respectively. We propose an amplification of the ML, called Tangent Bundle ML, in which the proximity not only between the original manifold and its estimator but also between their tangent spaces is required. We present a new algorithm that solves this problem and gives a new solution for the ML also."}
{"text": "  This technical note considers the problems of blind sparse learning and inference of electrogram (EGM) signals under atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions. First of all we introduce a mathematical model for the observed signals that takes into account the multiple foci typically appearing inside the heart during AF. Then we propose a reconstruction model based on a fixed dictionary and discuss several alternatives for choosing the dictionary. In order to obtain a sparse solution that takes into account the biological restrictions of the problem, a first alternative is using LASSO regularization followed by a post-processing stage that removes low amplitude coefficients violating the refractory period characteristic of cardiac cells. As an alternative we propose a novel regularization term, called cross products LASSO (CP-LASSO), that is able to incorporate the biological constraints directly into the optimization problem. Unfortunately, the resulting problem is non-convex, but we show how it can be solved efficiently in an approximated way making use of successive convex approximations (SCA). Finally, spectral analysis is performed on the clean activation sequence obtained from the sparse learning stage in order to estimate the number of latent foci and their frequencies. Simulations on synthetic and real data are provided to validate the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Organizing data into semantically more meaningful is one of the fundamental modes of understanding and learning. Cluster analysis is a formal study of methods for understanding and algorithm for learning. K-mean clustering algorithm is one of the most fundamental and simple clustering algorithms. When there is no prior knowledge about the distribution of data sets, K-mean is the first choice for clustering with an initial number of clusters. In this paper a novel distance metric called Design Specification (DS) distance measure function is integrated with K-mean clustering algorithm to improve cluster accuracy. The K-means algorithm with proposed distance measure maximizes the cluster accuracy to 99.98% at P = 1.525, which is determined through the iterative procedure. The performance of Design Specification (DS) distance measure function with K - mean algorithm is compared with the performances of other standard distance functions such as Euclidian, squared Euclidean, City Block, and Chebshew similarity measures deployed with K-mean algorithm.The proposed method is evaluated on the engineering materials database. The experiments on cluster analysis and the outlier profiling show that these is an excellent improvement in the performance of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  A new geometrically-motivated algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization is developed and applied to the discovery of latent \"topics\" for text and image \"document\" corpora. The algorithm is based on robustly finding and clustering extreme points of empirical cross-document word-frequencies that correspond to novel \"words\" unique to each topic. In contrast to related approaches that are based on solving non-convex optimization problems using suboptimal approximations, locally-optimal methods, or heuristics, the new algorithm is convex, has polynomial complexity, and has competitive qualitative and quantitative performance compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "  Partitioning a graph into groups of vertices such that those within each group are more densely connected than vertices assigned to different groups, known as graph clustering, is often used to gain insight into the organisation of large scale networks and for visualisation purposes. Whereas a large number of dedicated techniques have been recently proposed for static graphs, the design of on-line graph clustering methods tailored for evolving networks is a challenging problem, and much less documented in the literature. Motivated by the broad variety of applications concerned, ranging from the study of biological networks to the analysis of networks of scientific references through the exploration of communications networks such as the World Wide Web, it is the main purpose of this paper to introduce a novel, computationally efficient, approach to graph clustering in the evolutionary context. Namely, the method promoted in this article can be viewed as an incremental eigenvalue solution for the spectral clustering method described by Ng. et al. (2001). The incremental eigenvalue solution is a general technique for finding the approximate eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix given a change. As well as outlining the approach in detail, we present a theoretical bound on the quality of the approximate eigenvectors using perturbation theory. We then derive a novel spectral clustering algorithm called Incremental Approximate Spectral Clustering (IASC). The IASC algorithm is simple to implement and its efficacy is demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets modelling the evolution of a HIV epidemic, a citation network and the purchase history graph of an e-commerce website."}
{"text": "  We propose an approach to multivariate nonparametric regression that generalizes reduced rank regression for linear models. An additive model is estimated for each dimension of a $q$-dimensional response, with a shared $p$-dimensional predictor variable. To control the complexity of the model, we employ a functional form of the Ky-Fan or nuclear norm, resulting in a set of function estimates that have low rank. Backfitting algorithms are derived and justified using a nonparametric form of the nuclear norm subdifferential. Oracle inequalities on excess risk are derived that exhibit the scaling behavior of the procedure in the high dimensional setting. The methods are illustrated on gene expression data."}
{"text": "  Stochastic multi-armed bandits solve the Exploration-Exploitation dilemma and ultimately maximize the expected reward. Nonetheless, in many practical problems, maximizing the expected reward is not the most desirable objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting based on the principle of risk-aversion where the objective is to compete against the arm with the best risk-return trade-off. This setting proves to be intrinsically more difficult than the standard multi-arm bandit setting due in part to an exploration risk which introduces a regret associated to the variability of an algorithm. Using variance as a measure of risk, we introduce two new algorithms, investigate their theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results."}
{"text": "  Suppose that two large, multi-dimensional data sets are each noisy measurements of the same underlying random process, and principle components analysis is performed separately on the data sets to reduce their dimensionality. In some circumstances it may happen that the two lower-dimensional data sets have an inordinately large Procrustean fitting-error between them. The purpose of this manuscript is to quantify this \"incommensurability phenomenon.\" In particular, under specified conditions, the square Procrustean fitting-error of the two normalized lower-dimensional data sets is (asymptotically) a convex combination (via a correlation parameter) of the Hausdorff distance between the projection subspaces and the maximum possible value of the square Procrustean fitting-error for normalized data. We show how this gives rise to the incommensurability phenomenon, and we employ illustrative simulations as well as a real data experiment to explore how the incommensurability phenomenon may have an appreciable impact."}
{"text": "  We propose a spectral clustering method based on local principal components analysis (PCA). After performing local PCA in selected neighborhoods, the algorithm builds a nearest neighbor graph weighted according to a discrepancy between the principal subspaces in the neighborhoods, and then applies spectral clustering. As opposed to standard spectral methods based solely on pairwise distances between points, our algorithm is able to resolve intersections. We establish theoretical guarantees for simpler variants within a prototypical mathematical framework for multi-manifold clustering, and evaluate our algorithm on various simulated data sets."}
{"text": "  This paper is concerned with learning binary classifiers under adversarial label-noise. We introduce the problem of error-correction in learning where the goal is to recover the original clean data from a label-manipulated version of it, given (i) no constraints on the adversary other than an upper-bound on the number of errors, and (ii) some regularity properties for the original data. We present a simple and practical error-correction algorithm called SubSVMs that learns individual SVMs on several small-size (log-size), class-balanced, random subsets of the data and then reclassifies the training points using a majority vote. Our analysis reveals the need for the two main ingredients of SubSVMs, namely class-balanced sampling and subsampled bagging. Experimental results on synthetic as well as benchmark UCI data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In addition to noise-tolerance, log-size subsampled bagging also yields significant run-time benefits over standard SVMs."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the use of a simple posterior sampling algorithm to balance between exploration and exploitation when learning to optimize actions such as in multi-armed bandit problems. The algorithm, also known as Thompson Sampling, offers significant advantages over the popular upper confidence bound (UCB) approach, and can be applied to problems with finite or infinite action spaces and complicated relationships among action rewards. We make two theoretical contributions. The first establishes a connection between posterior sampling and UCB algorithms. This result lets us convert regret bounds developed for UCB algorithms into Bayesian regret bounds for posterior sampling. Our second theoretical contribution is a Bayesian regret bound for posterior sampling that applies broadly and can be specialized to many model classes. This bound depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards. Compared to UCB algorithm Bayesian regret bounds for specific model classes, our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger than the best available for generalized linear models. Further, our analysis provides insight into performance advantages of posterior sampling, which are highlighted through simulation results that demonstrate performance surpassing recently proposed UCB algorithms."}
{"text": "  Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference. When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian field, with the approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but intractable correction, and can be applied to the model's partition function and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP's local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to first order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP solution."}
{"text": "  We present an algorithm that learns representations which explicitly compensate for domain mismatch and which can be efficiently realized as linear classifiers. Specifically, we form a linear transformation that maps features from the target (test) domain to the source (training) domain as part of training the classifier. We optimize both the transformation and classifier parameters jointly, and introduce an efficient cost function based on misclassification loss. Our method combines several features previously unavailable in a single algorithm: multi-class adaptation through representation learning, ability to map across heterogeneous feature spaces, and scalability to large datasets. We present experiments on several image datasets that demonstrate improved accuracy and computational advantages compared to previous approaches."}
{"text": "  We present a feature learning model that learns to encode relationships between images. The model is defined as a Gated Boltzmann Machine, which is constrained such that hidden units that are nearby in space can gate each other's connections. We show how frequency/orientation \"columns\" as well as topographic filter maps follow naturally from training the model on image pairs. The model also helps explain why square-pooling models yield feature groups with similar grouping properties. Experimental results on synthetic image transformations show that spatially constrained gating is an effective way to reduce the number of parameters and thereby to regularize a transformation-learning model."}
{"text": "  Large-scale relational learning becomes crucial for handling the huge amounts of structured data generated daily in many application domains ranging from computational biology or information retrieval, to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link prediction on standard datasets from the literature."}

{"text": "  We proposea graphical model for multi-view feature extraction that automatically adapts its structure to achieve better representation of data distribution. The proposed model, structure-adapting multi-view harmonium (SA-MVH) has switch parameters that control the connection between hidden nodes and input views, and learn the switch parameter while training. Numerical experiments on synthetic and a real-world dataset demonstrate the useful behavior of the SA-MVH, compared to existing multi-view feature extraction methods."}
{"text": "  We develop a nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) for hierarchical topic modeling. The nHDP is a generalization of the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) that allows each word to follow its own path to a topic node according to a document-specific distribution on a shared tree. This alleviates the rigid, single-path formulation of the nCRP, allowing a document to more easily express thematic borrowings as a random effect. We demonstrate our algorithm on 1.8 million documents from The New York Times."}
{"text": "  We introduce a simple new regularizer for auto-encoders whose hidden-unit activation functions contain at least one zero-gradient (saturated) region. This regularizer explicitly encourages activations in the saturated region(s) of the corresponding activation function. We call these Saturating Auto-Encoders (SATAE). We show that the saturation regularizer explicitly limits the SATAE's ability to reconstruct inputs which are not near the data manifold. Furthermore, we show that a wide variety of features can be learned when different activation functions are used. Finally, connections are established with the Contractive and Sparse Auto-Encoders."}
{"text": "  Dictionary Learning has proven to be a powerful tool for many image processing tasks, where atoms are typically defined on small image patches. As a drawback, the dictionary only encodes basic structures. In addition, this approach treats patches of different locations in one single set, which means a loss of information when features are well-aligned across signals. This is the case, for instance, in multi-trial magneto- or electroencephalography (M/EEG). Learning the dictionary on the entire signals could make use of the alignement and reveal higher-level features. In this case, however, small missalignements or phase variations of features would not be compensated for. In this paper, we propose an extension to the common dictionary learning framework to overcome these limitations by allowing atoms to adapt their position across signals. The method is validated on simulated and real neuroelectric data."}
{"text": "  We study the use of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as a tool for the recognition of agents' behavior on the basis of observation of their sequential decision behavior interacting with the environment. We model the problem faced by the agents as a Markov decision process (MDP) and model the observed behavior of the agents in terms of forward planning for the MDP. We use IRL to learn reward functions and then use these reward functions as the basis for clustering or classification models. Experimental studies with GridWorld, a navigation problem, and the secretary problem, an optimal stopping problem, suggest reward vectors found from IRL can be a good basis for behavior pattern recognition problems. Empirical comparisons of our method with several existing IRL algorithms and with direct methods that use feature statistics observed in state-action space suggest it may be superior for recognition problems."}
{"text": "  Several recent results in machine learning have established formal connections between autoencoders---artificial neural network models that attempt to reproduce their inputs---and other coding models like sparse coding and K-means. This paper explores in depth an autoencoder model that is constructed using rectified linear activations on its hidden units. Our analysis builds on recent results to further unify the world of sparse linear coding models. We provide an intuitive interpretation of the behavior of these coding models and demonstrate this intuition using small, artificial datasets with known distributions."}
{"text": "  Simultaneously solving multiple related learning tasks is beneficial under a variety of circumstances, but the prior knowledge necessary to correctly model task relationships is rarely available in practice. In this paper, we develop a novel kernel-based multi-task learning technique that automatically reveals structural inter-task relationships. Building over the framework of output kernel learning (OKL), we introduce a method that jointly learns multiple functions and a low-rank multi-task kernel by solving a non-convex regularization problem. Optimization is carried out via a block coordinate descent strategy, where each subproblem is solved using suitable conjugate gradient (CG) type iterative methods for linear operator equations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on pharmacological and collaborative filtering data."}
{"text": "  Predicting the nodes of a given graph is a fascinating theoretical problem with applications in several domains. Since graph sparsification via spanning trees retains enough information while making the task much easier, trees are an important special case of this problem. Although it is known how to predict the nodes of an unweighted tree in a nearly optimal way, in the weighted case a fully satisfactory algorithm is not available yet. We fill this hole and introduce an efficient node predictor, Shazoo, which is nearly optimal on any weighted tree. Moreover, we show that Shazoo can be viewed as a common nontrivial generalization of both previous approaches for unweighted trees and weighted lines. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that Shazoo performs well in that it fully exploits the structure of the input tree, and gets very close to (and sometimes better than) less scalable energy minimization methods."}
{"text": "  In online learning the performance of an algorithm is typically compared to the performance of a fixed function from some class, with a quantity called regret. Forster proposed a last-step min-max algorithm which was somewhat simpler than the algorithm of Vovk, yet with the same regret. In fact the algorithm he analyzed assumed that the choices of the adversary are bounded, yielding artificially only the two extreme cases. We fix this problem by weighing the examples in such a way that the min-max problem will be well defined, and provide analysis with logarithmic regret that may have better multiplicative factor than both bounds of Forster and Vovk. We also derive a new bound that may be sub-logarithmic, as a recent bound of Orabona et.al, but may have better multiplicative factor. Finally, we analyze the algorithm in a weak-type of non-stationary setting, and show a bound that is sub-linear if the non-stationarity is sub-linear as well."}

{"text": "  Recommender systems are emerging technologies that nowadays can be found in many applications such as Amazon, Netflix, and so on. These systems help users to find relevant information, recommendations, and their preferred items. Slightly improvement of the accuracy of these recommenders can highly affect the quality of recommendations. Matrix Factorization is a popular method in Recommendation Systems showing promising results in accuracy and complexity. In this paper we propose an extension of matrix factorization which adds general neighborhood information on the recommendation model. Users and items are clustered into different categories to see how these categories share preferences. We then employ these shared interests of categories in a fusion by Biased Matrix Factorization to achieve more accurate recommendations. This is a complement for the current neighborhood aware matrix factorization models which rely on using direct neighborhood information of users and items. The proposed model is tested on two well-known recommendation system datasets: Movielens100k and Netflix. Our experiment shows applying the general latent features of categories into factorized recommender models improves the accuracy of recommendations. The current neighborhood-aware models need a great number of neighbors to acheive good accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is better than or comparable with the current neighborhood-aware models when they consider fewer number of neighbors."}
{"text": "  We study high-dimensional asymptotic performance limits of binary supervised classification problems where the class conditional densities are Gaussian with unknown means and covariances and the number of signal dimensions scales faster than the number of labeled training samples. We show that the Bayes error, namely the minimum attainable error probability with complete distributional knowledge and equally likely classes, can be arbitrarily close to zero and yet the limiting minimax error probability of every supervised learning algorithm is no better than a random coin toss. In contrast to related studies where the classification difficulty (Bayes error) is made to vanish, we hold it constant when taking high-dimensional limits. In contrast to VC-dimension based minimax lower bounds that consider the worst case error probability over all distributions that have a fixed Bayes error, our worst case is over the family of Gaussian distributions with constant Bayes error. We also show that a nontrivial asymptotic minimax error probability can only be attained for parametric subsets of zero measure (in a suitable measure space). These results expose the fundamental importance of prior knowledge and suggest that unless we impose strong structural constraints, such as sparsity, on the parametric space, supervised learning may be ineffective in high dimensional small sample settings."}
{"text": "  Identifying homogeneous subgroups of variables can be challenging in high dimensional data analysis with highly correlated predictors. We propose a new method called Hexagonal Operator for Regression with Shrinkage and Equality Selection, HORSES for short, that simultaneously selects positively correlated variables and identifies them as predictive clusters. This is achieved via a constrained least-squares problem with regularization that consists of a linear combination of an L_1 penalty for the coefficients and another L_1 penalty for pairwise differences of the coefficients. This specification of the penalty function encourages grouping of positively correlated predictors combined with a sparsity solution. We construct an efficient algorithm to implement the HORSES procedure. We show via simulation that the proposed method outperforms other variable selection methods in terms of prediction error and parsimony. The technique is demonstrated on two data sets, a small data set from analysis of soil in Appalachia, and a high dimensional data set from a near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy study, showing the flexibility of the methodology."}
{"text": "  In this paper, a novel approach for the optimal combination of binary classifiers is proposed. The classifier combination problem is approached from a Game Theory perspective. The proposed framework of adapted weighted majority rules (WMR) is tested against common rank-based, Bayesian and simple majority models, as well as two soft-output averaging rules. Experiments with ensembles of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Ordinary Binary Tree Classifiers (OBTC) and weighted k-nearest-neighbor (w/k-NN) models on benchmark datasets indicate that this new adaptive WMR model, employing local accuracy estimators and the analytically computed optimal weights outperform all the other simple combination rules."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel boosting approach to multi-class classification problems, in which multiple classes are distinguished by a set of random projection matrices in essence. The approach uses random projections to alleviate the proliferation of binary classifiers typically required to perform multi-class classification. The result is a multi-class classifier with a single vector-valued parameter, irrespective of the number of classes involved. Two variants of this approach are proposed. The first method randomly projects the original data into new spaces, while the second method randomly projects the outputs of learned weak classifiers. These methods are not only conceptually simple but also effective and easy to implement. A series of experiments on synthetic, machine learning and visual recognition data sets demonstrate that our proposed methods compare favorably to existing multi-class boosting algorithms in terms of both the convergence rate and classification accuracy."}
{"text": "  Canonical correlation analysis is a statistical technique that is used to find relations between two sets of variables. An important extension in pattern analysis is to consider more than two sets of variables. This problem can be expressed as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), commonly referred to Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA). This is a non-convex problem and so greedy algorithms converge to local optima without any guarantees on global optimality. In this paper, we show that despite being highly structured, finding the optimal solution is NP-Hard. This motivates our relaxation of the QCQP to a semidefinite program (SDP). The SDP is convex, can be solved reasonably efficiently and comes with both absolute and output-sensitive approximation quality. In addition to theoretical guarantees, we do an extensive comparison of the QCQP method and the SDP relaxation on a variety of synthetic and real world data. Finally, we present two useful extensions: we incorporate kernel methods and computing multiple sets of canonical vectors."}
{"text": "  We consider two scenarios of multiclass online learning of a hypothesis class $H\\subseteq Y^X$. In the {\\em full information} scenario, the learner is exposed to instances together with their labels. In the {\\em bandit} scenario, the true label is not exposed, but rather an indication whether the learner's prediction is correct or not. We show that the ratio between the error rates in the two scenarios is at most $8\\cdot|Y|\\cdot \\log(|Y|)$ in the realizable case, and $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{|Y|})$ in the agnostic case. The results are tight up to a logarithmic factor and essentially answer an open question from (Daniely et. al. - Multiclass learnability and the erm principle).   We apply these results to the class of $\\gamma$-margin multiclass linear classifiers in $\\reals^d$. We show that the bandit error rate of this class is $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\frac{|Y|}{\\gamma^2})$ in the realizable case and $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\sqrt{|Y|T})$ in the agnostic case. This resolves an open question from (Kakade et. al. - Efficient bandit algorithms for online multiclass prediction)."}
{"text": "  It has been shown that AIC-type criteria are asymptotically efficient selectors of the tuning parameter in non-concave penalized regression methods under the assumption that the population variance is known or that a consistent estimator is available. We relax this assumption to prove that AIC itself is asymptotically efficient and we study its performance in finite samples. In classical regression, it is known that AIC tends to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same shortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of the classical corrected AIC (AICc) as an alternative and prove that it maintains the desired asymptotic properties. To broaden our results, we further prove the efficiency of AIC for penalized likelihood methods in the context of generalized linear models with no dispersion parameter. Similar results exist in the literature but only for a restricted set of candidate models. By employing results from the classical literature on maximum-likelihood estimation in misspecified models, we are able to establish this result for a general set of candidate models. We use simulations to assess the performance of AIC and AICc, as well as that of other selectors, in finite samples for both SCAD-penalized and Lasso regressions and a real data example is considered."}
{"text": "  In this paper we consider learning in passive setting but with a slight modification. We assume that the target expected loss, also referred to as target risk, is provided in advance for learner as prior knowledge. Unlike most studies in the learning theory that only incorporate the prior knowledge into the generalization bounds, we are able to explicitly utilize the target risk in the learning process. Our analysis reveals a surprising result on the sample complexity of learning: by exploiting the target risk in the learning algorithm, we show that when the loss function is both strongly convex and smooth, the sample complexity reduces to $\\O(\\log (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$, an exponential improvement compared to the sample complexity $\\O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ for learning with strongly convex loss functions. Furthermore, our proof is constructive and is based on a computationally efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for such settings which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is practically useful."}
{"text": "  We design and analyze minimax-optimal algorithms for online linear optimization games where the player's choice is unconstrained. The player strives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a post-hoc benchmark strategy. The standard benchmark is the loss of the best strategy chosen from a bounded comparator set. When the the comparison set and the adversary's gradients satisfy L_infinity bounds, we give the value of the game in closed form and prove it approaches sqrt(2T/pi) as T -> infinity.   Interesting algorithms result when we consider soft constraints on the comparator, rather than restricting it to a bounded set. As a warmup, we analyze the game with a quadratic penalty. The value of this game is exactly T/2, and this value is achieved by perhaps the simplest online algorithm of all: unprojected gradient descent with a constant learning rate.   We then derive a minimax-optimal algorithm for a much softer penalty function. This algorithm achieves good bounds under the standard notion of regret for any comparator point, without needing to specify the comparator set in advance. The value of this game converges to sqrt{e} as T ->infinity; we give a closed-form for the exact value as a function of T. The resulting algorithm is natural in unconstrained investment or betting scenarios, since it guarantees at worst constant loss, while allowing for exponential reward against an \"easy\" adversary."}
{"text": "  We propose a tree ensemble method, referred to as time series forest (TSF), for time series classification. TSF employs a combination of the entropy gain and a distance measure, referred to as the Entrance (entropy and distance) gain, for evaluating the splits. Experimental studies show that the Entrance gain criterion improves the accuracy of TSF. TSF randomly samples features at each tree node and has a computational complexity linear in the length of a time series and can be built using parallel computing techniques such as multi-core computing used here. The temporal importance curve is also proposed to capture the important temporal characteristics useful for classification. Experimental studies show that TSF using simple features such as mean, deviation and slope outperforms strong competitors such as one-nearest-neighbor classifiers with dynamic time warping, is computationally efficient, and can provide insights into the temporal characteristics."}

{"text": "  We derive sublinear regret bounds for undiscounted reinforcement learning in continuous state space. The proposed algorithm combines state aggregation with the use of upper confidence bounds for implementing optimism in the face of uncertainty. Beside the existence of an optimal policy which satisfies the Poisson equation, the only assumptions made are Holder continuity of rewards and transition probabilities."}
{"text": "  The problem of selecting the right state-representation in a reinforcement learning problem is considered. Several models (functions mapping past observations to a finite set) of the observations are given, and it is known that for at least one of these models the resulting state dynamics are indeed Markovian. Without knowing neither which of the models is the correct one, nor what are the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting MDP, it is required to obtain as much reward as the optimal policy for the correct model (or for the best of the correct models, if there are several). We propose an algorithm that achieves that, with a regret of order T^{2/3} where T is the horizon time."}
{"text": "  We consider an agent interacting with an environment in a single stream of actions, observations, and rewards, with no reset. This process is not assumed to be a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Rather, the agent has several representations (mapping histories of past interactions to a discrete state space) of the environment with unknown dynamics, only some of which result in an MDP. The goal is to minimize the average regret criterion against an agent who knows an MDP representation giving the highest optimal reward, and acts optimally in it. Recent regret bounds for this setting are of order $O(T^{2/3})$ with an additive term constant yet exponential in some characteristics of the optimal MDP. We propose an algorithm whose regret after $T$ time steps is $O(\\sqrt{T})$, with all constants reasonably small. This is optimal in $T$ since $O(\\sqrt{T})$ is the optimal regret in the setting of learning in a (single discrete) MDP."}
{"text": "  Measurements made by satellite remote sensing, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and globally distributed Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are compared. Comparison of the two datasets measurements for aerosol optical depth values show that there are biases between the two data products. In this paper, we present a general framework towards identifying relevant set of variables responsible for the observed bias. We present a general framework to identify the possible factors influencing the bias, which might be associated with the measurement conditions such as the solar and sensor zenith angles, the solar and sensor azimuth, scattering angles, and surface reflectivity at the various measured wavelengths, etc. Specifically, we performed analysis for remote sensing Aqua-Land data set, and used machine learning technique, neural network in this case, to perform multivariate regression between the ground-truth and the training data sets. Finally, we used mutual information between the observed and the predicted values as the measure of similarity to identify the most relevant set of variables. The search is brute force method as we have to consider all possible combinations. The computations involves a huge number crunching exercise, and we implemented it by writing a job-parallel program."}
{"text": "  Distance metric learning is of fundamental interest in machine learning because the distance metric employed can significantly affect the performance of many learning methods. Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. Standard interior-point SDP solvers typically have a complexity of $O(D^{6.5})$ (with $D$ the dimension of input data), and can thus only practically solve problems exhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is $D (D+1) / 2 $, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can practically be solved of around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the popular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of problem to which metric learning can be applied. Here we propose a significantly more efficient approach to the metric learning problem based on the Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much simpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric learning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is $O (D ^ 3) $, which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach. Experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art, but is applicable to significantly larger problems. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to solve more general Frobenius-norm regularized SDP problems approximately."}
{"text": "  Very recently crowdsourcing has become the de facto platform for distributing and collecting human computation for a wide range of tasks and applications such as information retrieval, natural language processing and machine learning. Current crowdsourcing platforms have some limitations in the area of quality control. Most of the effort to ensure good quality has to be done by the experimenter who has to manage the number of workers needed to reach good results.   We propose a simple model for adaptive quality control in crowdsourced multiple-choice tasks which we call the \\emph{bandit survey problem}. This model is related to, but technically different from the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. We present several algorithms for this problem, and support them with analysis and simulations. Our approach is based in our experience conducting relevance evaluation for a large commercial search engine."}
{"text": "  Boosting is a method for learning a single accurate predictor by linearly combining a set of less accurate weak learners. Recently, structured learning has found many applications in computer vision. Inspired by structured support vector machines (SSVM), here we propose a new boosting algorithm for structured output prediction, which we refer to as StructBoost. StructBoost supports nonlinear structured learning by combining a set of weak structured learners. As SSVM generalizes SVM, our StructBoost generalizes standard boosting approaches such as AdaBoost, or LPBoost to structured learning. The resulting optimization problem of StructBoost is more challenging than SSVM in the sense that it may involve exponentially many variables and constraints. In contrast, for SSVM one usually has an exponential number of constraints and a cutting-plane method is used. In order to efficiently solve StructBoost, we formulate an equivalent $ 1 $-slack formulation and solve it using a combination of cutting planes and column generation. We show the versatility and usefulness of StructBoost on a range of problems such as optimizing the tree loss for hierarchical multi-class classification, optimizing the Pascal overlap criterion for robust visual tracking and learning conditional random field parameters for image segmentation."}
{"text": "  Thompson Sampling has recently been shown to be optimal in the Bernoulli Multi-Armed Bandit setting[Kaufmann et al., 2012]. This bandit problem assumes stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the real world as a stationary distribution. In this paper we derive and evaluate algorithms using Thompson Sampling for a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. We propose a Thompson Sampling strategy equipped with a Bayesian change point mechanism to tackle this problem. We develop algorithms for a variety of cases with constant switching rate: when switching occurs all arms change (Global Switching), switching occurs independently for each arm (Per-Arm Switching), when the switching rate is known and when it must be inferred from data. This leads to a family of algorithms we collectively term Change-Point Thompson Sampling (CTS). We show empirical results of the algorithm in 4 artificial environments, and 2 derived from real world data; news click-through[Yahoo!, 2011] and foreign exchange data[Dukascopy, 2012], comparing them to some other bandit algorithms. In real world data CTS is the most effective."}
{"text": "  We present two graph-based algorithms for multiclass segmentation of high-dimensional data. The algorithms use a diffuse interface model based on the Ginzburg-Landau functional, related to total variation compressed sensing and image processing. A multiclass extension is introduced using the Gibbs simplex, with the functional's double-well potential modified to handle the multiclass case. The first algorithm minimizes the functional using a convex splitting numerical scheme. The second algorithm is a uses a graph adaptation of the classical numerical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, which alternates between diffusion and thresholding. We demonstrate the performance of both algorithms experimentally on synthetic data, grayscale and color images, and several benchmark data sets such as MNIST, COIL and WebKB. We also make use of fast numerical solvers for finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian, and take advantage of the sparsity of the matrix. Experiments indicate that the results are competitive with or better than the current state-of-the-art multiclass segmentation algorithms."}

{"text": "  Spectral clustering (SC) and graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms are sensitive to how graphs are constructed from data. In particular if the data has proximal and unbalanced clusters these algorithms can lead to poor performance on well-known graphs such as $k$-NN, full-RBF, $\\epsilon$-graphs. This is because the objectives such as Ratio-Cut (RCut) or normalized cut (NCut) attempt to tradeoff cut values with cluster sizes, which are not tailored to unbalanced data. We propose a novel graph partitioning framework, which parameterizes a family of graphs by adaptively modulating node degrees in a $k$-NN graph. We then propose a model selection scheme to choose sizable clusters which are separated by smallest cut values. Our framework is able to adapt to varying levels of unbalancedness of data and can be naturally used for small cluster detection. We theoretically justify our ideas through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method."}
{"text": "  We investigate the generalizability of learned binary relations: functions that map pairs of instances to a logical indicator. This problem has application in numerous areas of machine learning, such as ranking, entity resolution and link prediction. Our learning framework incorporates an example labeler that, given a sequence $X$ of $n$ instances and a desired training size $m$, subsamples $m$ pairs from $X \\times X$ without replacement. The challenge in analyzing this learning scenario is that pairwise combinations of random variables are inherently dependent, which prevents us from using traditional learning-theoretic arguments. We present a unified, graph-based analysis, which allows us to analyze this dependence using well-known graph identities. We are then able to bound the generalization error of learned binary relations using Rademacher complexity and algorithmic stability. The rate of uniform convergence is partially determined by the labeler's subsampling process. We thus examine how various assumptions about subsampling affect generalization; under a natural random subsampling process, our bounds guarantee $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ uniform convergence."}
{"text": "  In adaptive dynamic programming, neurocontrol and reinforcement learning, the objective is for an agent to learn to choose actions so as to minimise a total cost function. In this paper we show that when discretized time is used to model the motion of the agent, it can be very important to do \"clipping\" on the motion of the agent in the final time step of the trajectory. By clipping we mean that the final time step of the trajectory is to be truncated such that the agent stops exactly at the first terminal state reached, and no distance further. We demonstrate that when clipping is omitted, learning performance can fail to reach the optimum; and when clipping is done properly, learning performance can improve significantly.   The clipping problem we describe affects algorithms which use explicit derivatives of the model functions of the environment to calculate a learning gradient. These include Backpropagation Through Time for Control, and methods based on Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming. However the clipping problem does not significantly affect methods based on Heuristic Dynamic Programming, Temporal Differences or Policy Gradient Learning algorithms. Similarly, the clipping problem does not affect fixed-length finite-horizon problems."}
{"text": "  We propose a version of the follow-the-perturbed-leader online prediction algorithm in which the cumulative losses are perturbed by independent symmetric random walks. The forecaster is shown to achieve an expected regret of the optimal order O(sqrt(n log N)) where n is the time horizon and N is the number of experts. More importantly, it is shown that the forecaster changes its prediction at most O(sqrt(n log N)) times, in expectation. We also extend the analysis to online combinatorial optimization and show that even in this more general setting, the forecaster rarely switches between experts while having a regret of near-optimal order."}
{"text": "  This paper addresses the problem of expressing a signal as a sum of frequency components (sinusoids) wherein each sinusoid may exhibit abrupt changes in its amplitude and/or phase. The Fourier transform of a narrow-band signal, with a discontinuous amplitude and/or phase function, exhibits spectral and temporal spreading. The proposed method aims to avoid such spreading by explicitly modeling the signal of interest as a sum of sinusoids with time-varying amplitudes. So as to accommodate abrupt changes, it is further assumed that the amplitude/phase functions are approximately piecewise constant (i.e., their time-derivatives are sparse). The proposed method is based on a convex variational (optimization) approach wherein the total variation (TV) of the amplitude functions are regularized subject to a perfect (or approximate) reconstruction constraint. A computationally efficient algorithm is derived based on convex optimization techniques. The proposed technique can be used to perform band-pass filtering that is relatively insensitive to narrow-band amplitude/phase jumps present in data, which normally pose a challenge (due to transients, leakage, etc.). The method is illustrated using both synthetic signals and human EEG data for the purpose of band-pass filtering and the estimation of phase synchrony indexes."}
{"text": "  This work develops a generic framework, called the bag-of-paths (BoP), for link and network data analysis. The central idea is to assign a probability distribution on the set of all paths in a network. More precisely, a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is defined over a bag of paths in a network, that is, on a representation that considers all paths independently. We show that, under this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes can easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion. This probability captures a notion of relatedness between nodes of the graph: two nodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many, preferably low-cost, paths. As an application, two families of distances between nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities. Interestingly, the second distance family interpolates between the shortest path distance and the resistance distance. In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for computing the shortest path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths by simply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator. Experimental results on semi-supervised classification show that both of the new distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths framework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network measures."}
{"text": "  In this paper we address the problem of predicting a time series using the ARMA (autoregressive moving average) model, under minimal assumptions on the noise terms. Using regret minimization techniques, we develop effective online learning algorithms for the prediction problem, without assuming that the noise terms are Gaussian, identically distributed or even independent. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm's performances asymptotically approaches the performance of the best ARMA model in hindsight."}
{"text": "  The framework of online learning with memory naturally captures learning problems with temporal constraints, and was previously studied for the experts setting. In this work we extend the notion of learning with memory to the general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework, and present two algorithms that attain low regret. The first algorithm applies to Lipschitz continuous loss functions, obtaining optimal regret bounds for both convex and strongly convex losses. The second algorithm attains the optimal regret bounds and applies more broadly to convex losses without requiring Lipschitz continuity, yet is more complicated to implement. We complement our theoretic results with an application to statistical arbitrage in finance: we devise algorithms for constructing mean-reverting portfolios."}
{"text": "  Gaussian process is a very promising novel technology that has been applied to both the regression problem and the classification problem. While for the regression problem it yields simple exact solutions, this is not the case for the classification problem, because we encounter intractable integrals. In this paper we develop a new derivation that transforms the problem into that of evaluating the ratio of multivariate Gaussian orthant integrals. Moreover, we develop a new Monte Carlo procedure that evaluates these integrals. It is based on some aspects of bootstrap sampling and acceptancerejection. The proposed approach has beneficial properties compared to the existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, such as simplicity, reliability, and speed."}
{"text": "  We consider online similarity prediction problems over networked data. We begin by relating this task to the more standard class prediction problem, showing that, given an arbitrary algorithm for class prediction, we can construct an algorithm for similarity prediction with \"nearly\" the same mistake bound, and vice versa. After noticing that this general construction is computationally infeasible, we target our study to {\\em feasible} similarity prediction algorithms on networked data. We initially assume that the network structure is {\\em known} to the learner. Here we observe that Matrix Winnow \\cite{w07} has a near-optimal mistake guarantee, at the price of cubic prediction time per round. This motivates our effort for an efficient implementation of a Perceptron algorithm with a weaker mistake guarantee but with only poly-logarithmic prediction time. Our focus then turns to the challenging case of networks whose structure is initially {\\em unknown} to the learner. In this novel setting, where the network structure is only incrementally revealed, we obtain a mistake-bounded algorithm with a quadratic prediction time per round."}
{"text": "  Fast nearest neighbor searching is becoming an increasingly important tool in solving many large-scale problems. Recently a number of approaches to learning data-dependent hash functions have been developed. In this work, we propose a column generation based method for learning data-dependent hash functions on the basis of proximity comparison information. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise proximity comparison information, our method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as well as possible within the large-margin learning framework. The learning procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation procedure, the best hash function is selected. Unlike most other hashing methods, our method generalizes to new data points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex, thus ensuring that the global optimum can be identified. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns compact binary codes and that its retrieval performance compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) has achieved state-of-the-art clustering quality by performing spectral clustering over a $\\ell^{1}$-norm based similarity graph. However, SSC is a transductive method which does not handle with the data not used to construct the graph (out-of-sample data). For each new datum, SSC requires solving $n$ optimization problems in O(n) variables for performing the algorithm over the whole data set, where $n$ is the number of data points. Therefore, it is inefficient to apply SSC in fast online clustering and scalable graphing. In this letter, we propose an inductive spectral clustering algorithm, called inductive Sparse Subspace Clustering (iSSC), which makes SSC feasible to cluster out-of-sample data. iSSC adopts the assumption that high-dimensional data actually lie on the low-dimensional manifold such that out-of-sample data could be grouped in the embedding space learned from in-sample data. Experimental results show that iSSC is promising in clustering out-of-sample data."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study the problem of learning from weakly labeled data, where labels of the training examples are incomplete. This includes, for example, (i) semi-supervised learning where labels are partially known; (ii) multi-instance learning where labels are implicitly known; and (iii) clustering where labels are completely unknown. Unlike supervised learning, learning with weak labels involves a difficult Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Therefore, it can suffer from poor scalability and may also get stuck in local minimum. In this paper, we focus on SVMs and propose the WellSVM via a novel label generation strategy. This leads to a convex relaxation of the original MIP, which is at least as tight as existing convex Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxations. Moreover, the WellSVM can be solved via a sequence of SVM subproblems that are much more scalable than previous convex SDP relaxations. Experiments on three weakly labeled learning tasks, namely, (i) semi-supervised learning; (ii) multi-instance learning for locating regions of interest in content-based information retrieval; and (iii) clustering, clearly demonstrate improved performance, and WellSVM is also readily applicable on large data sets."}
{"text": "  We propose a modular framework for multi-relational learning via tensor decomposition. In our learning setting, the training data contains multiple types of relationships among a set of objects, which we represent by a sparse three-mode tensor. The goal is to predict the values of the missing entries. To do so, we model each relationship as a function of a linear combination of latent factors. We learn this latent representation by computing a low-rank tensor decomposition, using quasi-Newton optimization of a weighted objective function. Sparsity in the observed data is captured by the weighted objective, leading to improved accuracy when training data is limited. Exploiting sparsity also improves efficiency, potentially up to an order of magnitude over unweighted approaches. In addition, our framework accommodates arbitrary combinations of smooth, task-specific loss functions, making it better suited for learning different types of relations. For the typical cases of real-valued functions and binary relations, we propose several loss functions and derive the associated parameter gradients. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real data, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and scalability over related factorization techniques."}
{"text": "  Mismatching problem between the source and target noisy corpora severely hinder the practical use of the machine-learning-based voice activity detection (VAD). In this paper, we try to address this problem in the transfer learning prospective. Transfer learning tries to find a common learning machine or a common feature subspace that is shared by both the source corpus and the target corpus. The denoising deep neural network is used as the learning machine. Three transfer techniques, which aim to learn common feature representations, are used for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the transfer learning schemes on the mismatch problem."}
{"text": "  Multitask clustering tries to improve the clustering performance of multiple tasks simultaneously by taking their relationship into account. Most existing multitask clustering algorithms fall into the type of generative clustering, and none are formulated as convex optimization problems. In this paper, we propose two convex Discriminative Multitask Clustering (DMTC) algorithms to address the problems. Specifically, we first propose a Bayesian DMTC framework. Then, we propose two convex DMTC objectives within the framework. The first one, which can be seen as a technical combination of the convex multitask feature learning and the convex Multiclass Maximum Margin Clustering (M3C), aims to learn a shared feature representation. The second one, which can be seen as a combination of the convex multitask relationship learning and M3C, aims to learn the task relationship. The two objectives are solved in a uniform procedure by the efficient cutting-plane algorithm. Experimental results on a toy problem and two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "  One important classifier ensemble for multiclass classification problems is Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOCs). It bridges multiclass problems and binary-class classifiers by decomposing multiclass problems to a serial binary-class problems. In this paper, we present a heuristic ternary code, named Weight Optimization and Layered Clustering-based ECOC (WOLC-ECOC). It starts with an arbitrary valid ECOC and iterates the following two steps until the training risk converges. The first step, named Layered Clustering based ECOC (LC-ECOC), constructs multiple strong classifiers on the most confusing binary-class problem. The second step adds the new classifiers to ECOC by a novel Optimized Weighted (OW) decoding algorithm, where the optimization problem of the decoding is solved by the cutting plane algorithm. Technically, LC-ECOC makes the heuristic training process not blocked by some difficult binary-class problem. OW decoding guarantees the non-increase of the training risk for ensuring a small code length. Results on 14 UCI datasets and a music genre classification problem demonstrate the effectiveness of WOLC-ECOC."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new approach to variable selection, called Predictive Correlation Screening, for predictor design. Predictive Correlation Screening (PCS) implements false positive control on the selected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for Familywise Error Rate (FWER), and resultant mean square error of a linear predictor on the selected variables. We apply Predictive Correlation Screening to the following two-stage predictor design problem. An experimenter wants to learn a multivariate predictor of gene expressions based on successive biological samples assayed on mRNA arrays. She assays the whole genome on a few samples and from these assays she selects a small number of variables using Predictive Correlation Screening. To reduce assay cost, she subsequently assays only the selected variables on the remaining samples, to learn the predictor coefficients. We show superiority of Predictive Correlation Screening relative to LASSO and correlation learning (sometimes popularly referred to in the literature as marginal regression or simple thresholding) in terms of performance and computational complexity."}
{"text": "  Concept Hierarchies and Formal Concept Analysis are theoretically well grounded and largely experimented methods. They rely on line diagrams called Galois lattices for visualizing and analysing object-attribute sets. Galois lattices are visually seducing and conceptually rich for experts. However they present important drawbacks due to their concept oriented overall structure: analysing what they show is difficult for non experts, navigation is cumbersome, interaction is poor, and scalability is a deep bottleneck for visual interpretation even for experts. In this paper we introduce semantic probes as a means to overcome many of these problems and extend usability and application possibilities of traditional FCA visualization methods. Semantic probes are visual user centred objects which extract and organize reduced Galois sub-hierarchies. They are simpler, clearer, and they provide a better navigation support through a rich set of interaction possibilities. Since probe driven sub-hierarchies are limited to users focus, scalability is under control and interpretation is facilitated. After some successful experiments, several applications are being developed with the remaining problem of finding a compromise between simplicity and conceptual expressivity."}
{"text": "  The concept of refinement from probability elicitation is considered for proper scoring rules. Taking directions from the axioms of probability, refinement is further clarified using a Hilbert space interpretation and reformulated into the underlying data distribution setting where connections to maximal marginal diversity and conditional entropy are considered and used to derive measures that provide arbitrarily tight bounds on the Bayes error. Refinement is also reformulated into the classifier output setting and its connections to calibrated classifiers and proper margin losses are established."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a noisy function, given a finite budget n of noisy evaluations to the function. We tackle in this paper the problem of adapting to the function at the same time the number of samples into each stratum and the partition itself. More precisely, it is interesting to refine the partition of the domain in area where the noise to the function, or where the variations of the function, are very heterogeneous. On the other hand, having a (too) refined stratification is not optimal. Indeed, the more refined the stratification, the more difficult it is to adjust the allocation of the samples to the stratification, i.e. sample more points where the noise or variations of the function are larger. We provide in this paper an algorithm that selects online, among a large class of partitions, the partition that provides the optimal trade-off, and allocates the samples almost optimally on this partition."}
{"text": "  The fundamental aim of clustering algorithms is to partition data points. We consider tasks where the discovered partition is allowed to vary with some covariate such as space or time. One approach would be to use fragmentation-coagulation processes, but these, being Markov processes, are restricted to linear or tree structured covariate spaces. We define a partition-valued process on an arbitrary covariate space using Gaussian processes. We use the process to construct a multitask clustering model which partitions datapoints in a similar way across multiple data sources, and a time series model of network data which allows cluster assignments to vary over time. We describe sampling algorithms for inference and apply our method to defining cancer subtypes based on different types of cellular characteristics, finding regulatory modules from gene expression data from multiple human populations, and discovering time varying community structure in a social network."}
{"text": "  The goal of a learner in standard online learning is to maintain an average loss close to the loss of the best-performing single function in some class. In many real-world problems, such as rating or ranking items, there is no single best target function during the runtime of the algorithm, instead the best (local) target function is drifting over time. We develop a novel last-step minmax optimal algorithm in context of a drift. We analyze the algorithm in the worst-case regret framework and show that it maintains an average loss close to that of the best slowly changing sequence of linear functions, as long as the total of drift is sublinear. In some situations, our bound improves over existing bounds, and additionally the algorithm suffers logarithmic regret when there is no drift. We also build on the H_infinity filter and its bound, and develop and analyze a second algorithm for drifting setting. Synthetic simulations demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms in a worst-case constant drift setting."}
{"text": "  Quorum sensing is a decentralized biological process, through which a community of cells with no global awareness coordinate their functional behaviors based solely on cell-medium interactions and local decisions. This paper draws inspirations from quorum sensing and colony competition to derive a new algorithm for data clustering. The algorithm treats each data as a single cell, and uses knowledge of local connectivity to cluster cells into multiple colonies simultaneously. It simulates auto-inducers secretion in quorum sensing to tune the influence radius for each cell. At the same time, sparsely distributed core cells spread their influences to form colonies, and interactions between colonies eventually determine each cell's identity. The algorithm has the flexibility to analyze not only static but also time-varying data, which surpasses the capacity of many existing algorithms. Its stability and convergence properties are established. The algorithm is tested on several applications, including both synthetic and real benchmarks data sets, alleles clustering, community detection, image segmentation. In particular, the algorithm's distinctive capability to deal with time-varying data allows us to experiment it on novel applications such as robotic swarms grouping and switching model identification. We believe that the algorithm's promising performance would stimulate many more exciting applications."}
{"text": "  In imbalanced multi-class classification problems, the misclassification rate as an error measure may not be a relevant choice. Several methods have been developed where the performance measure retained richer information than the mere misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information, etc. Following this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we propose to address imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to be optimized: the norm of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show that using the norm of the confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite interesting due to the fine-grain informations contained in the matrix, especially in the case of imbalanced classes. Our first contribution then consists in showing that optimizing criterion based on the confusion matrix gives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods aimed at dealing with imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution, we propose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method --- namely AdaBoost.MM --- to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing the empirical norm of the confusion matrix. A theoretical analysis of the properties of the proposed method is presented, while experimental results illustrate the behavior of the algorithm and show the relevancy of the approach compared to other methods."}
{"text": "  Since Hamming distances can be calculated by bitwise computations, they can be calculated with less computational load than L2 distances. Similarity searches can therefore be performed faster in Hamming distance space. The elements of Hamming distance space are bit strings. On the other hand, the arrangement of hyperplanes induce the transformation from the feature vectors into feature bit strings. This transformation method is a type of locality-sensitive hashing that has been attracting attention as a way of performing approximate similarity searches at high speed. Supervised learning of hyperplane arrangements allows us to obtain a method that transforms them into feature bit strings reflecting the information of labels applied to higher-dimensional feature vectors. In this p aper, we propose a supervised learning method for hyperplane arrangements in feature space that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We consider the probability density functions used during learning, and evaluate their performance. We also consider the sampling method for learning data pairs needed in learning, and we evaluate its performance. We confirm that the accuracy of this learning method when using a suitable probability density function and sampling method is greater than the accuracy of existing learning methods."}
{"text": "  We reduce the memory footprint of popular large-scale online learning methods by projecting our weight vector onto a coarse discrete set using randomized rounding. Compared to standard 32-bit float encodings, this reduces RAM usage by more than 50% during training and by up to 95% when making predictions from a fixed model, with almost no loss in accuracy. We also show that randomized counting can be used to implement per-coordinate learning rates, improving model quality with little additional RAM. We prove these memory-saving methods achieve regret guarantees similar to their exact variants. Empirical evaluation confirms excellent performance, dominating standard approaches across memory versus accuracy tradeoffs."}
{"text": "  The k-support norm has been recently introduced to perform correlated sparsity regularization. Although Argyriou et al. only reported experiments using squared loss, here we apply it to several other commonly used settings resulting in novel machine learning algorithms with interesting and familiar limit cases.

{"text": "  We propose a novel approach for nonlinear regression using a two-layer neural network (NN) model structure with sparsity-favoring hierarchical priors on the network weights. We present an expectation propagation (EP) approach for approximate integration over the posterior distribution of the weights, the hierarchical scale parameters of the priors, and the residual scale. Using a factorized posterior approximation we derive a computationally efficient algorithm, whose complexity scales similarly to an ensemble of independent sparse linear models. The approach enables flexible definition of weight priors with different sparseness properties such as independent Laplace priors with a common scale parameter or Gaussian automatic relevance determination (ARD) priors with different relevance parameters for all inputs. The approach can be extended beyond standard activation functions and NN model structures to form flexible nonlinear predictors from multiple sparse linear models. The effects of the hierarchical priors and the predictive performance of the algorithm are assessed using both simulated and real-world data. Comparisons are made to two alternative models with ARD priors: a Gaussian process with a NN covariance function and marginal maximum a posteriori estimates of the relevance parameters, and a NN with Markov chain Monte Carlo integration over all the unknown model parameters."}
{"text": "  Learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes that preserve the Euclidean distance in the original space. Manifold learning techniques, in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original high-dimensional data. The complexity of these models, and the problems with out-of-sample data, have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, we consider how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds. In order to address the above-mentioned difficulties, we describe an efficient, inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method. Our proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. We particularly show that hashing on the basis of t-SNE ."}
{"text": "  We consider learning a causal ordering of variables in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model called LiNGAM. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But, the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions actually are violated. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. The key idea is to detect latent confounders by testing independence between estimated external influences and find subsets (parcels) that include variables that are not affected by latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data and simulated brain imaging data."}
{"text": "  Traditional algorithms for stochastic optimization require projecting the solution at each iteration into a given domain to ensure its feasibility. When facing complex domains, such as positive semi-definite cones, the projection operation can be expensive, leading to a high computational cost per iteration. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that aims to reduce the number of projections for stochastic optimization. The proposed algorithm combines the strength of several recent developments in stochastic optimization, including mini-batch, extra-gradient, and epoch gradient descent, in order to effectively explore the smoothness and strong convexity. We show, both in expectation and with a high probability, that when the objective function is both smooth and strongly convex, the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal $O(1/T)$ rate of convergence with only $O(\\log T)$ projections. Our empirical study verifies the theoretical result."}
{"text": "  Distance metric learning (DML) is an important task that has found applications in many domains. The high computational cost of DML arises from the large number of variables to be determined and the constraint that a distance metric has to be a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix. Although stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been successfully applied to improve the efficiency of DML, it can still be computationally expensive because in order to ensure that the solution is a PSD matrix, it has to, at every iteration, project the updated distance metric onto the PSD cone, an expensive operation. We address this challenge by developing two strategies within SGD, i.e. mini-batch and adaptive sampling, to effectively reduce the number of updates (i.e., projections onto the PSD cone) in SGD. We also develop hybrid approaches that combine the strength of adaptive sampling with that of mini-batch online learning techniques to further improve the computational efficiency of SGD for DML. We prove the theoretical guarantees for both adaptive sampling and mini-batch based approaches for DML. We also conduct an extensive empirical study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for DML."}
{"text": "  Applications of non-linear kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to large datasets is seriously hampered by its excessive training time. We propose a modification, called the approximate extreme points support vector machine (AESVM), that is aimed at overcoming this burden. Our approach relies on conducting the SVM optimization over a carefully selected subset, called the representative set, of the training dataset. We present analytical results that indicate the similarity of AESVM and SVM solutions. A linear time algorithm based on convex hulls and extreme points is used to compute the representative set in kernel space. Extensive computational experiments on nine datasets compared AESVM to LIBSVM \\citep{LIBSVM}, CVM \\citep{Tsang05}, BVM \\citep{Tsang07}, LASVM \\citep{Bordes05}, $\\text{SVM}^{\\text{perf}}$ \\citep{Joachims09}, and the random features method \\citep{rahimi07}. Our AESVM implementation was found to train much faster than the other methods, while its classification accuracy was similar to that of LIBSVM in all cases. In particular, for a seizure detection dataset, AESVM training was almost $10^3$ times faster than LIBSVM and LASVM and more than forty times faster than CVM and BVM. Additionally, AESVM also gave competitively fast classification times."}
{"text": "  Online learning algorithms are fast, memory-efficient, easy to implement, and applicable to many prediction problems, including classification, regression, and ranking. Several online algorithms were proposed in the past few decades, some based on additive updates, like the Perceptron, and some on multiplicative updates, like Winnow. A unifying perspective on the design and the analysis of online algorithms is provided by online mirror descent, a general prediction strategy from which most first-order algorithms can be obtained as special cases. We generalize online mirror descent to time-varying regularizers with generic updates. Unlike standard mirror descent, our more general formulation also captures second order algorithms, algorithms for composite losses and algorithms for adaptive filtering. Moreover, we recover, and sometimes improve, known regret bounds as special cases of our analysis using specific regularizers. Finally, we show the power of our approach by deriving a new second order algorithm with a regret bound invariant with respect to arbitrary rescalings of individual features."}
{"text": "  Many studies in data mining have proposed a new learning called semi-Supervised. Such type of learning combines unlabeled and labeled data which are hard to obtain. However, in unsupervised methods, the only unlabeled data are used. The problem of significance and the effectiveness of semi-supervised clustering results is becoming of main importance. This paper pursues the thesis that muchgreater accuracy can be achieved in such clustering by improving the similarity computing. Hence, we introduce a new approach of semisupervised clustering using an innovative new homogeneity measure of generated clusters. Our experimental results demonstrate significantly improved accuracy as a result."}
{"text": "  Popular sparse estimation methods based on $\\ell_1$-relaxation, such as the Lasso and the Dantzig selector, require the knowledge of the variance of the noise in order to properly tune the regularization parameter. This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks---such as time series, random fields, inverse problems---for which the noise is rarely homoscedastic and its level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure."}
{"text": "  We study low rank matrix and tensor completion and propose novel algorithms that employ adaptive sampling schemes to obtain strong performance guarantees. Our algorithms exploit adaptivity to identify entries that are highly informative for learning the column space of the matrix (tensor) and consequently, our results hold even when the row space is highly coherent, in contrast with previous analyses. In the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a $n \\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ from merely $\\Omega(n r^{3/2}\\log(r))$ matrix entries. We also show that one can recover an order $T$ tensor using $\\Omega(n r^{T-1/2}T^2 \\log(r))$ entries. For noisy recovery, our algorithm consistently estimates a low rank matrix corrupted with noise using $\\Omega(n r^{3/2} \\textrm{polylog}(n))$ entries. We complement our study with simulations that verify our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms."}

{"text": "  The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for multilook full polarimetric SAR data whose adequacy has been attested in the literature. Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques which depend on this model have been devised, and many of them employ some type of dissimilarity measure. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for four stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these distances, inequalities are obtained which lead to new ways of deriving the Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the discrimination and homogeneity identification capabilities of these distances."}
{"text": "  In recent years, a great many methods of learning from multi-view data by considering the diversity of different views have been proposed. These views may be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying to organize and highlight similarities and differences between the variety of multi-view learning approaches, we review a number of representative multi-view learning algorithms in different areas and classify them into three groups: 1) co-training, 2) multiple kernel learning, and 3) subspace learning. Notably, co-training style algorithms train alternately to maximize the mutual agreement on two distinct views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms exploit kernels that naturally correspond to different views and combine kernels either linearly or non-linearly to improve learning performance; and subspace learning algorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by multiple views by assuming that the input views are generated from this latent subspace. Though there is significant variance in the approaches to integrating multiple views to improve learning performance, they mainly exploit either the consensus principle or the complementary principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning. Since accessing multiple views is the fundament of multi-view learning, with the exception of study on learning a model from multiple views, it is also valuable to study how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these views. Overall, by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of different views, multi-view learning is rendered more effective, more promising, and has better generalization ability than single-view learning."}
{"text": "  We consider the stochastic and adversarial settings of continuum armed bandits where the arms are indexed by [0,1]^d. The reward functions r:[0,1]^d -> R are assumed to intrinsically depend on at most k coordinate variables implying r(x_1,..,x_d) = g(x_{i_1},..,x_{i_k}) for distinct and unknown i_1,..,i_k from {1,..,d} and some locally Holder continuous g:[0,1]^k -> R with exponent 0 < alpha <= 1. Firstly, assuming (i_1,..,i_k) to be fixed across time, we propose a simple modification of the CAB1 algorithm where we construct the discrete set of sampling points to obtain a bound of O(n^((alpha+k)/(2*alpha+k)) (log n)^((alpha)/(2*alpha+k)) C(k,d)) on the regret, with C(k,d) depending at most polynomially in k and sub-logarithmically in d. The construction is based on creating partitions of {1,..,d} into k disjoint subsets and is probabilistic, hence our result holds with high probability. Secondly we extend our results to also handle the more general case where (i_1,...,i_k) can change over time and derive regret bounds for the same."}
{"text": "  We propose a new method for detecting changes in Markov network structure between two sets of samples. Instead of naively fitting two Markov network models separately to the two data sets and figuring out their difference, we \\emph{directly} learn the network structure change by estimating the ratio of Markov network models. This density-ratio formulation naturally allows us to introduce sparsity in the network structure change, which highly contributes to enhancing interpretability. Furthermore, computation of the normalization term, which is a critical bottleneck of the naive approach, can be remarkably mitigated. We also give the dual formulation of the optimization problem, which further reduces the computation cost for large-scale Markov networks. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of embedding entities and relations of knowledge bases in low-dimensional vector spaces. Unlike most existing approaches, which are primarily efficient for modeling equivalence relations, our approach is designed to explicitly model irreflexive relations, such as hierarchies, by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Preliminary experiments show that, despite its simplicity and a smaller number of parameters than previous approaches, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance according to standard evaluation protocols on data from WordNet and Freebase."}
{"text": "  Fractals are self-similar recursive structures that have been used in modeling several real world processes. In this work we study how \"fractal-like\" processes arise in a prediction game where an adversary is generating a sequence of bits and an algorithm is trying to predict them. We will see that under a certain formalization of the predictive payoff for the algorithm it is most optimal for the adversary to produce a fractal-like sequence to minimize the algorithm's ability to predict. Indeed it has been suggested before that financial markets exhibit a fractal-like behavior. We prove that a fractal-like distribution arises naturally out of an optimization from the adversary's perspective.   In addition, we give optimal trade-offs between predictability and expected deviation (i.e. sum of bits) for our formalization of predictive payoff. This result is motivated by the observation that several time series data exhibit higher deviations than expected for a completely random walk."}
{"text": "  We introduce the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a measure of non-linear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimension based on the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\\'enyi Maximum Correlation Coefficient. RDC is defined in terms of correlation of random non-linear copula projections; it is invariant with respect to marginal distribution transformations, has low computational cost and is easy to implement: just five lines of R code, included at the end of the paper."}

{"text": "  We consider the following signal recovery problem: given a measurement matrix $\\Phi\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}$ and a noisy observation vector $c\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ constructed from $c = \\Phi\\theta^* + \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d. centered sub-Gaussian distribution, how to recover the signal $\\theta^*$ if $D\\theta^*$ is sparse {\\rca under a linear transformation} $D\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times p}$? One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem: $$\\min_{\\theta} {1\\over 2}\\|\\Phi\\theta - c\\|^2 + \\lambda\\|D\\theta\\|_1.$$ This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix $\\Phi$ is a Gaussian random matrix. Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement number $n\\geq \\Omega(s\\log(p))$ where $s$ is the sparsity number, then the true solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement increases faster than $s\\log(p)$, that is, $s\\log(p)=o(n)$, the estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when $p$ and $s$ go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the special case $D=\\bold{I}_{p\\times p}$ (equivalently LASSO) and improve the existing analysis. The condition number of $D$ plays a critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant, while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with high probability if $m\\over p$ (i.e., $#text{edge}\\over #text{vertex}$) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical simulations are consistent with our theoretical results."}
{"text": "  We consider the unsupervised learning problem of assigning labels to unlabeled data. A naive approach is to use clustering methods, but this works well only when data is properly clustered and each cluster corresponds to an underlying class. In this paper, we first show that this unsupervised labeling problem in balanced binary cases can be solved if two unlabeled datasets having different class balances are available. More specifically, estimation of the sign of the difference between probability densities of two unlabeled datasets gives the solution. We then introduce a new method to directly estimate the sign of the density difference without density estimation. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method against several clustering methods on various toy problems and real-world datasets."}

{"text": "  Dasgupta and Shulman showed that a two-round variant of the EM algorithm can learn mixture of Gaussian distributions with near optimal precision with high probability if the Gaussian distributions are well separated and if the dimension is sufficiently high. In this paper, we generalize their theory to learning mixture of high-dimensional Bernoulli templates. Each template is a binary vector, and a template generates examples by randomly switching its binary components independently with a certain probability. In computer vision applications, a binary vector is a feature map of an image, where each binary component indicates whether a local feature or structure is present or absent within a certain cell of the image domain. A Bernoulli template can be considered as a statistical model for images of objects (or parts of objects) from the same category. We show that the two-round EM algorithm can learn mixture of Bernoulli templates with near optimal precision with high probability, if the Bernoulli templates are sufficiently different and if the number of features is sufficiently high. We illustrate the theoretical results by synthetic and real examples."}
{"text": "  Deep learning research aims at discovering learning algorithms that discover multiple levels of distributed representations, with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. Although the study of deep learning has already led to impressive theoretical results, learning algorithms and breakthrough experiments, several challenges lie ahead. This paper proposes to examine some of these challenges, centering on the questions of scaling deep learning algorithms to much larger models and datasets, reducing optimization difficulties due to ill-conditioning or local minima, designing more efficient and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle the factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes a few forward-looking research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges."}
{"text": "  In this study, a novel machine learning algorithm, restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), is introduced. The algorithm is applied for the spectral classification in astronomy. RBM is a bipartite generative graphical model with two separate layers (one visible layer and one hidden layer), which can extract higher level features to represent the original data. Despite generative, RBM can be used for classification when modified with a free energy and a soft-max function. Before spectral classification, the original data is binarized according to some rule. Then we resort to the binary RBM to classify cataclysmic variables (CVs) and non-CVs (one half of all the given data for training and the other half for testing). The experiment result shows state-of-the-art accuracy of 100%, which indicates the efficiency of the binary RBM algorithm."}
{"text": "  Methods for analyzing or learning from \"fuzzy data\" have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In many cases, however, existing methods (for precise, non-fuzzy data) are extended to the fuzzy case in an ad-hoc manner, and without carefully considering the interpretation of a fuzzy set when being used for modeling data. Distinguishing between an ontic and an epistemic interpretation of fuzzy set-valued data, and focusing on the latter, we argue that a \"fuzzification\" of learning algorithms based on an application of the generic extension principle is not appropriate. In fact, the extension principle fails to properly exploit the inductive bias underlying statistical and machine learning methods, although this bias, at least in principle, offers a means for \"disambiguating\" the fuzzy data. Alternatively, we therefore propose a method which is based on the generalization of loss functions in empirical risk minimization, and which performs model identification and data disambiguation simultaneously. Elaborating on the fuzzification of specific types of losses, we establish connections to well-known loss functions in regression and classification. We compare our approach with related methods and illustrate its use in logistic regression for binary classification."}
{"text": "  Representation learning and unsupervised learning are two central topics of machine learning and signal processing. Deep learning is one of the most effective unsupervised representation learning approach. The main contributions of this paper to the topics are as follows. (i) We propose to view the representative deep learning approaches as special cases of the knowledge reuse framework of clustering ensemble. (ii) We propose to view sparse coding when used as a feature encoder as the consensus function of clustering ensemble, and view dictionary learning as the training process of the base clusterings of clustering ensemble. (ii) Based on the above two views, we propose a very simple deep learning algorithm, named deep random model ensemble (DRME). It is a stack of random model ensembles. Each random model ensemble is a special k-means ensemble that discards the expectation-maximization optimization of each base k-means but only preserves the default initialization method of the base k-means. (iv) We propose to select the most powerful representation among the layers by applying DRME to clustering where the single-linkage is used as the clustering algorithm. Moreover, the DRME based clustering can also detect the number of the natural clusters accurately. Extensive experimental comparisons with 5 representation learning methods on 19 benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of DRME."}
{"text": "  We consider the classical question of predicting binary sequences and study the {\\em optimal} algorithms for obtaining the best possible regret and payoff functions for this problem. The question turns out to be also equivalent to the problem of optimal trade-offs between the regrets of two experts in an \"experts problem\", studied before by \\cite{kearns-regret}. While, say, a regret of $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ is known, we argue that it important to ask what is the provably optimal algorithm for this problem --- both because it leads to natural algorithms, as well as because regret is in fact often comparable in magnitude to the final payoffs and hence is a non-negligible term.   In the basic setting, the result essentially follows from a classical result of Cover from '65. Here instead, we focus on another standard setting, of time-discounted payoffs, where the final \"stopping time\" is not specified. We exhibit an explicit characterization of the optimal regret for this setting.   To obtain our main result, we show that the optimal payoff functions have to satisfy the Hermite differential equation, and hence are given by the solutions to this equation. It turns out that characterization of the payoff function is qualitatively different from the classical (non-discounted) setting, and, namely, there's essentially a unique optimal solution."}
{"text": "  AUC is an important performance measure and many algorithms have been devoted to AUC optimization, mostly by minimizing a surrogate convex loss on a training data set. In this work, we focus on one-pass AUC optimization that requires only going through the training data once without storing the entire training dataset, where conventional online learning algorithms cannot be applied directly because AUC is measured by a sum of losses defined over pairs of instances from different classes. We develop a regression-based algorithm which only needs to maintain the first and second order statistics of training data in memory, resulting a storage requirement independent from the size of training data. To efficiently handle high dimensional data, we develop a randomized algorithm that approximates the covariance matrices by low rank matrices. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  In last few years there are major changes and evolution has been done on classification of data. As the application area of technology is increases the size of data also increases. Classification of data becomes difficult because of unbounded size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem become greatest issue in data mining. Imbalance problem occur where one of the two classes having more sample than other classes. The most of algorithm are more focusing on classification of major sample while ignoring or misclassifying minority sample. The minority samples are those that rarely occur but very important. There are different methods available for classification of imbalance data set which is divided into three main categories, the algorithmic approach, data-preprocessing approach and feature selection approach. Each of this technique has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper systematic study of each approach is define which gives the right direction for research in class imbalance problem."}
{"text": "  We propose an original model for inferring team strengths using a Markov Random Field, which can be used to generate historical estimates of the offensive and defensive strengths of a team over time. This model was designed to be applied to sports such as soccer or hockey, in which contest outcomes take value in a limited discrete space. We perform inference using a combination of Expectation Maximization and Loopy Belief Propagation. The challenges of working with a non-convex optimization problem and a high-dimensional parameter space are discussed. The performance of the model is demonstrated on professional soccer data from the English Premier League."}
{"text": "  In the internet era there has been an explosion in the amount of digital text information available, leading to difficulties of scale for traditional inference algorithms for topic models. Recent advances in stochastic variational inference algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have made it feasible to learn topic models on large-scale corpora, but these methods do not currently take full advantage of the collapsed representation of the model. We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian inference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the art method. We show connections between collapsed variational Bayesian inference and MAP estimation for LDA, and leverage these connections to prove convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. In experiments on large-scale text corpora, the algorithm was found to converge faster and often to a better solution than the previous method. Human-subject experiments also demonstrated that the method can learn coherent topics in seconds on small corpora, facilitating the use of topic models in interactive document analysis software."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of online combinatorial optimization under semi-bandit feedback. The goal of the learner is to sequentially select its actions from a combinatorial decision set so as to minimize its cumulative loss. We propose a learning algorithm for this problem based on combining the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) prediction method with a novel loss estimation procedure called Geometric Resampling (GR). Contrary to previous solutions, the resulting algorithm can be efficiently implemented for any decision set where efficient offline combinatorial optimization is possible at all. Assuming that the elements of the decision set can be described with d-dimensional binary vectors with at most m non-zero entries, we show that the expected regret of our algorithm after T rounds is O(m sqrt(dT log d)). As a side result, we also improve the best known regret bounds for FPL in the full information setting to O(m^(3/2) sqrt(T log d)), gaining a factor of sqrt(d/m) over previous bounds for this algorithm."}
{"text": "  Stochastic neurons can be useful for a number of reasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic neurons, i.e., can we \"back-propagate\" through these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of solutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated that a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but noisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron firing probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small perturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this estimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is small. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very general settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the estimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in reinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating this unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a biased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of the gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of the gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold, but like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range. This is similar to traditional sigmoidal units but has the advantage that for many inputs, a hard decision (e.g., a 0 output) can be produced, which would be convenient for conditional computation and achieving sparse representations and sparse gradients."}
{"text": "  Auto-encoder is a special kind of neural network based on reconstruction. De-noising auto-encoder (DAE) is an improved auto-encoder which is robust to the input by corrupting the original data first and then reconstructing the original input by minimizing the reconstruction error function. And contractive auto-encoder (CAE) is another kind of improved auto-encoder to learn robust feature by introducing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobean matrix of the learned feature with respect to the original input. In this paper, we combine de-noising auto-encoder and contractive auto- encoder, and propose another improved auto-encoder, contractive de-noising auto- encoder (CDAE), which is robust to both the original input and the learned feature. We stack CDAE to extract more abstract features and apply SVM for classification. The experiment result on benchmark dataset MNIST shows that our proposed CDAE performed better than both DAE and CAE, proving the effective of our method."}
{"text": "  Spatio-temporal point process models play a central role in the analysis of spatially distributed systems in several disciplines. Yet, scalable inference remains computa- tionally challenging both due to the high resolution modelling generally required and the analytically intractable likelihood function. Here, we exploit the sparsity structure typical of (spatially) discretised log-Gaussian Cox process models by using approximate message-passing algorithms. The proposed algorithms scale well with the state dimension and the length of the temporal horizon with moderate loss in distributional accuracy. They hence provide a flexible and faster alternative to both non-linear filtering-smoothing type algorithms and to approaches that implement the Laplace method or expectation propagation on (block) sparse latent Gaussian models. We infer the parameters of the latent Gaussian model using a structured variational Bayes approach. We demonstrate the proposed framework on simulation studies with both Gaussian and point-process observations and use it to reconstruct the conflict intensity and dynamics in Afghanistan from the WikiLeaks Afghan War Diary."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of joint modelling of metabolic signals and gene expression in systems biology applications. We propose an approach based on input-output factorial hidden Markov models and propose a structured variational inference approach to infer the structure and states of the model. We start from the classical free form structured variational mean field approach and use a expectation propagation to approximate the expectations needed in the variational loop. We show that this corresponds to a factored expectation constrained approximate inference. We validate our model through extensive simulations and demonstrate its applicability on a real world bacterial data set."}
{"text": "  We present a novel approach for the construction of ensemble classifiers based on dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods represent datasets using a small number of attributes while preserving the information conveyed by the original dataset. The ensemble members are trained based on dimension-reduced versions of the training set. These versions are obtained by applying dimensionality reduction to the original training set using different values of the input parameters. This construction meets both the diversity and accuracy criteria which are required to construct an ensemble classifier where the former criterion is obtained by the various input parameter values and the latter is achieved due to the decorrelation and noise reduction properties of dimensionality reduction. In order to classify a test sample, it is first embedded into the dimension reduced space of each individual classifier by using an out-of-sample extension algorithm. Each classifier is then applied to the embedded sample and the classification is obtained via a voting scheme. We present three variations of the proposed approach based on the Random Projections, the Diffusion Maps and the Random Subspaces dimensionality reduction algorithms. We also present a multi-strategy ensemble which combines AdaBoost and Diffusion Maps. A comparison is made with the Bagging, AdaBoost, Rotation Forest ensemble classifiers and also with the base classifier which does not incorporate dimensionality reduction. Our experiments used seventeen benchmark datasets from the UCI repository. The results obtained by the proposed algorithms were superior in many cases to other algorithms."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of vertex classification for graphs constructed from the latent position model. It was shown previously that the approach of embedding the graphs into some Euclidean space followed by classification in that space can yields a universally consistent vertex classifier. However, a major technical difficulty of the approach arises when classifying unlabeled out-of-sample vertices without including them in the embedding stage. In this paper, we studied the out-of-sample extension for the graph embedding step and its impact on the subsequent inference tasks. We show that, under the latent position graph model and for sufficiently large $n$, the mapping of the out-of-sample vertices is close to its true latent position. We then demonstrate that successful inference for the out-of-sample vertices is possible."}
{"text": "  We study the adaptive estimation of copula correlation matrix $\\Sigma$ for the semi-parametric elliptical copula model. In this context, the correlations are connected to Kendall's tau through a sine function transformation. Hence, a natural estimate for $\\Sigma$ is the plug-in estimator $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ with Kendall's tau statistic. We first obtain a sharp bound on the operator norm of $\\hat{\\Sigma}-\\Sigma$. Then we study a factor model of $\\Sigma$, for which we propose a refined estimator $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}$ by fitting a low-rank matrix plus a diagonal matrix to $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ using least squares with a nuclear norm penalty on the low-rank matrix. The bound on the operator norm of $\\hat{\\Sigma}-\\Sigma$ serves to scale the penalty term, and we obtain finite sample oracle inequalities for $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}$. We also consider an elementary factor copula model of $\\Sigma$, for which we propose closed-form estimators. All of our estimation procedures are entirely data-driven."}
{"text": "  Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly capture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the corruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error, and the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying data-generating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty)."}
{"text": "  Correlation matrices play a key role in many multivariate methods (e.g., graphical model estimation and factor analysis). The current state-of-the-art in estimating large correlation matrices focuses on the use of Pearson's sample correlation matrix. Although Pearson's sample correlation matrix enjoys various good properties under Gaussian models, it is not an effective estimator when facing heavy-tailed distributions. As a robust alternative, Han and Liu [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 109 (2015) 275-287] advocated the use of a transformed version of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix in estimating high dimensional latent generalized correlation matrix under the transelliptical distribution family (or elliptical copula). The transelliptical family assumes that after unspecified marginal monotone transformations, the data follow an elliptical distribution. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix and its transformed version proposed in Han and Liu [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 109 (2015) 275-287] for estimating the population Kendall's tau correlation matrix and the latent Pearson's correlation matrix under both spectral and restricted spectral norms. With regard to the spectral norm, we highlight the role of \"effective rank\" in quantifying the rate of convergence. With regard to the restricted spectral norm, we for the first time present a \"sign sub-Gaussian condition\" which is sufficient to guarantee that the rank-based correlation matrix estimator attains the fast rate of convergence. In both cases, we do not need any moment condition."}
{"text": "  Many solutions to cost-sensitive classification (and regression) rely on some or all of the following assumptions: we have complete knowledge about the cost context at training time, we can easily re-train whenever the cost context changes, and we have technique-specific methods (such as cost-sensitive decision trees) that can take advantage of that information. In this paper we address the problem of selecting models and minimising joint cost (integrating both misclassification cost and test costs) without any of the above assumptions. We introduce methods and plots (such as the so-called JROC plots) that can work with any off-the-shelf predictive technique, including ensembles, such that we reframe the model to use the appropriate subset of attributes (the feature configuration) during deployment time. In other words, models are trained with the available attributes (once and for all) and then deployed by setting missing values on the attributes that are deemed ineffective for reducing the joint cost. As the number of feature configuration combinations grows exponentially with the number of features we introduce quadratic methods that are able to approximate the optimal configuration and model choices, as shown by the experimental results."}
{"text": "  In recent years, manifold learning has become increasingly popular as a tool for performing non-linear dimensionality reduction. This has led to the development of numerous algorithms of varying degrees of complexity that aim to recover man ifold geometry using either local or global features of the data.   Building on the Laplacian Eigenmap and Diffusionmaps framework, we propose a new paradigm that offers a guarantee, under reasonable assumptions, that any manifo ld learning algorithm will preserve the geometry of a data set. Our approach is based on augmenting the output of embedding algorithms with geometric informatio n embodied in the Riemannian metric of the manifold. We provide an algorithm for estimating the Riemannian metric from data and demonstrate possible application s of our approach in a variety of examples."}
{"text": "  In systems biomedicine, an experimenter encounters different potential sources of variation in data such as individual samples, multiple experimental conditions, and multi-variable network-level responses. In multiparametric cytometry, which is often used for analyzing patient samples, such issues are critical. While computational methods can identify cell populations in individual samples, without the ability to automatically match them across samples, it is difficult to compare and characterize the populations in typical experiments, such as those responding to various stimulations or distinctive of particular patients or time-points, especially when there are many samples. Joint Clustering and Matching (JCM) is a multi-level framework for simultaneous modeling and registration of populations across a cohort. JCM models every population with a robust multivariate probability distribution. Simultaneously, JCM fits a random-effects model to construct an overall batch template -- used for registering populations across samples, and classifying new samples. By tackling systems-level variation, JCM supports practical biomedical applications involving large cohorts."}
{"text": "  The ACT-R theory of cognition developed by John Anderson and colleagues endeavors to explain how humans recall chunks of information and how they solve problems. ACT-R also serves as a theoretical basis for \"cognitive tutors\", i.e., automatic tutoring systems that help students learn mathematics, computer programming, and other subjects. The official ACT-R definition is distributed across a large body of literature spanning many articles and monographs, and hence it is difficult for an \"outsider\" to learn the most important aspects of the theory. This paper aims to provide a tutorial to the core components of the ACT-R theory."}
{"text": "  Random Forest (RF) is a powerful supervised learner and has been popularly used in many applications such as bioinformatics.   In this work we propose the guided random forest (GRF) for feature selection. Similar to a feature selection method called guided regularized random forest (GRRF), GRF is built using the importance scores from an ordinary RF. However, the trees in GRRF are built sequentially, are highly correlated and do not allow for parallel computing, while the trees in GRF are built independently and can be implemented in parallel. Experiments on 10 high-dimensional gene data sets show that, with a fixed parameter value (without tuning the parameter), RF applied to features selected by GRF outperforms RF applied to all features on 9 data sets and 7 of them have significant differences at the 0.05 level. Therefore, both accuracy and interpretability are significantly improved. GRF selects more features than GRRF, however, leads to better classification accuracy. Note in this work the guided random forest is guided by the importance scores from an ordinary random forest, however, it can also be guided by other methods such as human insights (by specifying $\\lambda_i$). GRF can be used in \"RRF\" v1.4 (and later versions), a package that also includes the regularized random forest methods."}
{"text": "  We introduce a general constructive setting of the density ratio estimation problem as a solution of a (multidimensional) integral equation. In this equation, not only its right hand side is known approximately, but also the integral operator is defined approximately. We show that this ill-posed problem has a rigorous solution and obtain the solution in a closed form. The key element of this solution is the novel V-matrix, which captures the geometry of the observed samples. We compare our method with three well-known previously proposed ones. Our experimental results demonstrate the good potential of the new approach."}
{"text": "  Optimal transportation distances are a fundamental family of parameterized distances for histograms. Despite their appealing theoretical properties, excellent performance in retrieval tasks and intuitive formulation, their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost is prohibitive whenever the histograms' dimension exceeds a few hundreds. We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn-Knopp's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers. We also report improved performance over classical optimal transportation distances on the MNIST benchmark problem."}
{"text": "  Causal inference relies on the structure of a graph, often a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Different graphs may result in different causal inference statements and different intervention distributions. To quantify such differences, we propose a (pre-) distance between DAGs, the structural intervention distance (SID). The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements. It is therefore well-suited for evaluating graphs that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs it is also possible to compare CPDAGs, completed partially directed acyclic graphs that represent Markov equivalence classes. Since it differs significantly from the popular Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), the SID constitutes a valuable additional measure. We discuss properties of this distance and provide an efficient implementation with software code available on the first author's homepage (an R package is under construction)."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining."}
{"text": "  Feature selection (FS) is a process which attempts to select more informative features. In some cases, too many redundant or irrelevant features may overpower main features for classification. Feature selection can remedy this problem and therefore improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the computational overhead of classification algorithms. The main aim of feature selection is to determine a minimal feature subset from a problem domain while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original features. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Rough PCA, Unsupervised Quick Reduct (USQR) algorithm and Empirical Distribution Ranking (EDR) approaches are applied to discover discriminative features that will be the most adequate ones for classification. Efficiency of the approaches is evaluated using standard classification metrics."}
{"text": "  We propose a learning setting in which unlabeled data is free, and the cost of a label depends on its value, which is not known in advance. We study binary classification in an extreme case, where the algorithm only pays for negative labels. Our motivation are applications such as fraud detection, in which investigating an honest transaction should be avoided if possible. We term the setting auditing, and consider the auditing complexity of an algorithm: the number of negative labels the algorithm requires in order to learn a hypothesis with low relative error. We design auditing algorithms for simple hypothesis classes (thresholds and rectangles), and show that with these algorithms, the auditing complexity can be significantly lower than the active label complexity. We also discuss a general competitive approach for auditing and possible modifications to the framework."}
{"text": "  Learning an appropriate (dis)similarity function from the available data is a central problem in machine learning, since the success of many machine learning algorithms critically depends on the choice of a similarity function to compare examples. Despite many approaches for similarity metric learning have been proposed, there is little theoretical study on the links between similarity met- ric learning and the classification performance of the result classifier. In this paper, we propose a regularized similarity learning formulation associated with general matrix-norms, and establish their generalization bounds. We show that the generalization error of the resulting linear separator can be bounded by the derived generalization bound of similarity learning. This shows that a good gen- eralization of the learnt similarity function guarantees a good classification of the resulting linear classifier. Our results extend and improve those obtained by Bellet at al. [3]. Due to the techniques dependent on the notion of uniform stability [6], the bound obtained there holds true only for the Frobenius matrix- norm regularization. Our techniques using the Rademacher complexity [5] and its related Khinchin-type inequality enable us to establish bounds for regularized similarity learning formulations associated with general matrix-norms including sparse L 1 -norm and mixed (2,1)-norm."}
{"text": "  This paper generalizes beta divergence beyond its classical form associated with power variance functions of Tweedie models. Generalized form is represented by a compact definite integral as a function of variance function of the exponential dispersion model. This compact integral form simplifies derivations of many properties such as scaling, translation and expectation of the beta divergence. Further, we show that beta divergence and (half of) the statistical deviance are equivalent measures."}
{"text": "  The strategy of early stopping is a regularization technique based on choosing a stopping time for an iterative algorithm. Focusing on non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we analyze the early stopping strategy for a form of gradient-descent applied to the least-squares loss function. We propose a data-dependent stopping rule that does not involve hold-out or cross-validation data, and we prove upper bounds on the squared error of the resulting function estimate, measured in either the $L^2(P)$ and $L^2(P_n)$ norm. These upper bounds lead to minimax-optimal rates for various kernel classes, including Sobolev smoothness classes and other forms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show through simulation that our stopping rule compares favorably to two other stopping rules, one based on hold-out data and the other based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate. We also establish a tight connection between our early stopping strategy and the solution path of a kernel ridge regression estimator."}
{"text": "  The problem of low-rank matrix estimation recently received a lot of attention due to challenging applications. A lot of work has been done on rank-penalized methods and convex relaxation, both on the theoretical and applied sides. However, only a few papers considered Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we review the different type of priors considered on matrices to favour low-rank. We also prove that the obtained Bayesian estimators, under suitable assumptions, enjoys the same optimality properties as the ones based on penalization."}
{"text": "  We carefully investigate the on-line version of PCA, where in each trial a learning algorithm plays a k-dimensional subspace, and suffers the compression loss on the next instance when projected into the chosen subspace. In this setting, we analyze two popular on-line algorithms, Gradient Descent (GD) and Exponentiated Gradient (EG). We show that both algorithms are essentially optimal in the worst-case. This comes as a surprise, since EG is known to perform sub-optimally when the instances are sparse. This different behavior of EG for PCA is mainly related to the non-negativity of the loss in this case, which makes the PCA setting qualitatively different from other settings studied in the literature. Furthermore, we show that when considering regret bounds as function of a loss budget, EG remains optimal and strictly outperforms GD. Next, we study the extension of the PCA setting, in which the Nature is allowed to play with dense instances, which are positive matrices with bounded largest eigenvalue. Again we can show that EG is optimal and strictly better than GD in this setting."}
{"text": "  We consider robust covariance estimation with group symmetry constraints. Non-Gaussian covariance estimation, e.g., Tyler scatter estimator and Multivariate Generalized Gaussian distribution methods, usually involve non-convex minimization problems. Recently, it was shown that the underlying principle behind their success is an extended form of convexity over the geodesics in the manifold of positive definite matrices. A modern approach to improve estimation accuracy is to exploit prior knowledge via additional constraints, e.g., restricting the attention to specific classes of covariances which adhere to prior symmetry structures. In this paper, we prove that such group symmetry constraints are also geodesically convex and can therefore be incorporated into various non-Gaussian covariance estimators. Practical examples of such sets include: circulant, persymmetric and complex/quaternion proper structures. We provide a simple numerical technique for finding maximum likelihood estimates under such constraints, and demonstrate their performance advantage using synthetic experiments."}

{"text": "  What if there is a teacher who knows the learning goal and wants to design good training data for a machine learner? We propose an optimal teaching framework aimed at learners who employ Bayesian models. Our framework is expressed as an optimization problem over teaching examples that balance the future loss of the learner and the effort of the teacher. This optimization problem is in general hard. In the case where the learner employs conjugate exponential family models, we present an approximate algorithm for finding the optimal teaching set. Our algorithm optimizes the aggregate sufficient statistics, then unpacks them into actual teaching examples. We give several examples to illustrate our framework."}
{"text": "  We provide theoretical analysis of the statistical and computational properties of penalized $M$-estimators that can be formulated as the solution to a possibly nonconvex optimization problem. Many important estimators fall in this category, including least squares regression with nonconvex regularization, generalized linear models with nonconvex regularization and sparse elliptical random design regression. For these problems, it is intractable to calculate the global solution due to the nonconvex formulation. In this paper, we propose an approximate regularization path-following method for solving a variety of learning problems with nonconvex objective functions. Under a unified analytic framework, we simultaneously provide explicit statistical and computational rates of convergence for any local solution attained by the algorithm. Computationally, our algorithm attains a global geometric rate of convergence for calculating the full regularization path, which is optimal among all first-order algorithms. Unlike most existing methods that only attain geometric rates of convergence for one single regularization parameter, our algorithm calculates the full regularization path with the same iteration complexity. In particular, we provide a refined iteration complexity bound to sharply characterize the performance of each stage along the regularization path. Statistically, we provide sharp sample complexity analysis for all the approximate local solutions along the regularization path. In particular, our analysis improves upon existing results by providing a more refined sample complexity bound as well as an exact support recovery result for the final estimator. These results show that the final estimator attains an oracle statistical property due to the usage of nonconvex penalty."}
{"text": "  Adaptive filtering algorithms operating in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have demonstrated superiority over their linear counterpart for nonlinear system identification. Unfortunately, an undesirable characteristic of these methods is that the order of the filters grows linearly with the number of input data. This dramatically increases the computational burden and memory requirement. A variety of strategies based on dictionary learning have been proposed to overcome this severe drawback. Few, if any, of these works analyze the problem of updating the dictionary in a time-varying environment. In this paper, we present an analytical study of the convergence behavior of the Gaussian least-mean-square algorithm in the case where the statistics of the dictionary elements only partially match the statistics of the input data. This allows us to emphasize the need for updating the dictionary in an online way, by discarding the obsolete elements and adding appropriate ones. We introduce a kernel least-mean-square algorithm with L1-norm regularization to automatically perform this task. The stability in the mean of this method is analyzed, and its performance is tested with experiments."}

We present the first stage for which we have conducted a knowledge discovery approach on a sample of acoustical data. We use MFCC features extracted from bird songs and we exploit two knowledge discovery techniques. One that relies on clustering-based approaches, that highlights the homogeneity in the songs of the species. The other, based on predictive modeling, that demonstrates the good performances of various machine learning techniques for the identification process. The knowledge elicited provides promising results to consider a widespread study and to elicit guidelines for designing a first version of the automatic approach for data collection based on acoustic sensors."}
{"text": "  The feature space (including both input and output variables) characterises a data mining problem. In predictive (supervised) problems, the quality and availability of features determines the predictability of the dependent variable, and the performance of data mining models in terms of misclassification or regression error. Good features, however, are usually difficult to obtain. It is usual that many instances come with missing values, either because the actual value for a given attribute was not available or because it was too expensive. This is usually interpreted as a utility or cost-sensitive learning dilemma, in this case between misclassification (or regression error) costs and attribute tests costs. Both misclassification cost (MC) and test cost (TC) can be integrated into a single measure, known as joint cost (JC). We introduce methods and plots (such as the so-called JROC plots) that can work with any of-the-shelf predictive technique, including ensembles, such that we re-frame the model to use the appropriate subset of attributes (the feature configuration) during deployment time. In other words, models are trained with the available attributes (once and for all) and then deployed by setting missing values on the attributes that are deemed ineffective for reducing the joint cost.

{"text": "  We study sparse principal component analysis for high dimensional vector autoregressive time series under a doubly asymptotic framework, which allows the dimension $d$ to scale with the series length $T$. We treat the transition matrix of time series as a nuisance parameter and directly apply sparse principal component analysis on multivariate time series as if the data are independent. We provide explicit non-asymptotic rates of convergence for leading eigenvector estimation and extend this result to principal subspace estimation. Our analysis illustrates that the spectral norm of the transition matrix plays an essential role in determining the final rates. We also characterize sufficient conditions under which sparse principal component analysis attains the optimal parametric rate. Our theoretical results are backed up by thorough numerical studies."}
{"text": "  In multiclass semi-supervised learning (SSL), it is sometimes the case that the number of classes present in the data is not known, and hence no labeled examples are provided for some classes. In this paper we present variants of well-known semi-supervised multiclass learning methods that are robust when the data contains an unknown number of classes. In particular, we present an \"exploratory\" extension of expectation-maximization (EM) that explores different numbers of classes while learning. \"Exploratory\" SSL greatly improves performance on three datasets in terms of F1 on the classes with seed examples i.e., the classes which are expected to be in the data. Our Exploratory EM algorithm also outperforms a SSL method based non-parametric Bayesian clustering."}
{"text": "  The vector autoregressive (VAR) model is a powerful tool in modeling complex time series and has been exploited in many fields. However, fitting high dimensional VAR model poses some unique challenges: On one hand, the dimensionality, caused by modeling a large number of time series and higher order autoregressive processes, is usually much higher than the time series length; On the other hand, the temporal dependence structure in the VAR model gives rise to extra theoretical challenges. In high dimensions, one popular approach is to assume the transition matrix is sparse and fit the VAR model using the \"least squares\" method with a lasso-type penalty. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative way in estimating the VAR model. The main idea is, via exploiting the temporal dependence structure, to formulate the estimating problem into a linear program. There is instant advantage for the proposed approach over the lasso-type estimators: The estimation equation can be decomposed into multiple sub-equations and accordingly can be efficiently solved in a parallel fashion. In addition, our method brings new theoretical insights into the VAR model analysis. So far the theoretical results developed in high dimensions (e.g., Song and Bickel (2011) and Kock and Callot (2012)) mainly pose assumptions on the design matrix of the formulated regression problems. Such conditions are indirect about the transition matrices and not transparent. In contrast, our results show that the operator norm of the transition matrices plays an important role in estimation accuracy. We provide explicit rates of convergence for both estimation and prediction. In addition, we provide thorough experiments on both synthetic and real-world equity data to show that there are empirical advantages of our method over the lasso-type estimators in both parameter estimation and forecasting."}
{"text": "  The Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM) is a non-linear probabilistic method of embedding a high dimensional dataset in terms low dimensional `latent' variables. In this paper we illustrate that maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the latent variables and hyperparameters can be used for model selection and hence we can determine the optimal number or latent variables and the most appropriate model. This is an alternative to the variational approaches developed recently and may be useful when we want to use a non-Gaussian prior or kernel functions that don't have automatic relevance determination (ARD) parameters. Using a second order expansion of the latent variable posterior we can marginalise the latent variables and obtain an estimate for the hyperparameter posterior. Secondly, we use the GP-LVM to integrate multiple data sources by simultaneously embedding them in terms of common latent variables. We present results from synthetic data to illustrate the successful detection and retrieval of low dimensional structure from high dimensional data. We demonstrate that the integration of multiple data sources leads to more robust performance. Finally, we show that when the data are used for binary classification tasks we can attain a significant gain in prediction accuracy when the low dimensional representation is used."}
{"text": "  The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central problem in the analysis of financial time series. A common approach is to express these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function is assumed to be constant but this may be inaccurate when there are covariates that could have a large influence on the dependence structure of the data. To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other time-varying copula methods."}
{"text": "  This tutorial gives a concise overview of existing PAC-Bayesian theory focusing on three generalization bounds. The first is an Occam bound which handles rules with finite precision parameters and which states that generalization loss is near training loss when the number of bits needed to write the rule is small compared to the sample size. The second is a PAC-Bayesian bound providing a generalization guarantee for posterior distributions rather than for individual rules. The PAC-Bayesian bound naturally handles infinite precision rule parameters, $L_2$ regularization, {\\em provides a bound for dropout training}, and defines a natural notion of a single distinguished PAC-Bayesian posterior distribution. The third bound is a training-variance bound --- a kind of bias-variance analysis but with bias replaced by expected training loss. The training-variance bound dominates the other bounds but is more difficult to interpret. It seems to suggest variance reduction methods such as bagging and may ultimately provide a more meaningful analysis of dropouts."}
{"text": "  The interaction between transitivity and sparsity, two common features in empirical networks, implies that there are local regions of large sparse networks that are dense. We call this the blessing of transitivity and it has consequences for both modeling and inference. Extant research suggests that statistical inference for the Stochastic Blockmodel is more difficult when the edges are sparse. However, this conclusion is confounded by the fact that the asymptotic limit in all of the previous studies is not merely sparse, but also non-transitive. To retain transitivity, the blocks cannot grow faster than the expected degree. Thus, in sparse models, the blocks must remain asymptotically small. \\n Previous algorithmic research demonstrates that small \"local\" clusters are more amenable to computation, visualization, and interpretation when compared to \"global\" graph partitions. This paper provides the first statistical results that demonstrate how these small transitive clusters are also more amenable to statistical estimation. Theorem 2 shows that a \"local\" clustering algorithm can, with high probability, detect a transitive stochastic block of a fixed size (e.g. 30 nodes) embedded in a large graph. The only constraint on the ambient graph is that it is large and sparse--it could be generated at random or by an adversary--suggesting a theoretical explanation for the robust empirical performance of local clustering algorithms."}
{"text": "  Community detection in graphs has been the subject of many algorithms. Recent methods want to optimize a modularity function which shows a maximum of relationships within communities and found a minimum of inter-community relations. these algorithms are applied to unipartite, multipartite and directed graphs. However, given the NP-completeness of the problem, these algorithms are heuristics that do not guarantee an optimum. In this paper we introduce an algorithm which, based on an approximate solution obtained through a efficient detection algorithm, modifie it to achieve a local optimum based on a function. this reassignment function is a potential function and therefore the computed optimum is a Nash equilibrium. We supplement our method with an overlap function that allows to have simultaneously the two detection modes. Several experiments show the interest of our approach."}
{"text": "  Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (and thus Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a finite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families."}

{"text": "  The multi-label classification problem has generated significant interest in recent years. However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key challenges: (a) the ability to tackle problems with a large number (say millions) of labels, and (b) the ability to handle data with missing labels. In this paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label problem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the structure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to offer efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits formal excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our risk bounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive) Frobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present extensive empirical results on a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our methods perform significantly better than existing label compression based methods and can scale up to very large datasets such as the Wikipedia dataset."}
{"text": "  In this paper we study a generalized version of classical multi-armed bandits (MABs) problem by allowing for arbitrary constraints on constituent bandits at each decision point. The motivation of this study comes from many situations that involve repeatedly making choices subject to arbitrary constraints in an uncertain environment: for instance, regularly deciding which advertisements to display online in order to gain high click-through-rate without knowing user preferences, or what route to drive home each day under uncertain weather and traffic conditions. Assume that there are $K$ unknown random variables (RVs), i.e., arms, each evolving as an \\emph{i.i.d} stochastic process over time. At each decision epoch, we select a strategy, i.e., a subset of RVs, subject to arbitrary constraints on constituent RVs.   We then gain a reward that is a linear combination of observations on selected RVs.   The performance of prior results for this problem heavily depends on the distribution of strategies generated by corresponding learning policy. For example, if the reward-difference between the best and second best strategy approaches zero, prior result may lead to arbitrarily large regret.   Meanwhile, when there are exponential number of possible strategies at each decision point, naive extension of a prior distribution-free policy would cause poor performance in terms of regret, computation and space complexity.   To this end, we propose an efficient Distribution-Free Learning (DFL) policy that achieves zero regret, regardless of the probability distribution of the resultant strategies.   Our learning policy has both $O(K)$ time complexity and $O(K)$ space complexity. In successive generations, we show that even if finding the optimal strategy at each decision point is NP-hard, our policy still allows for approximated solutions while retaining near zero-regret."}
{"text": "  We present a scalable and effective classification model to train multi-class boosting for multi-class classification problems. Shen and Hao introduced a direct formulation of multi- class boosting in the sense that it directly maximizes the multi- class margin [C. Shen and Z. Hao, \"A direct formulation for totally-corrective multi- class boosting\", in Proc. IEEE Conf. Comp. Vis. Patt. Recogn., 2011]. The major problem of their approach is its high computational complexity for training, which hampers its application on real-world problems. In this work, we propose a scalable and simple stage-wise multi-class boosting method, which also directly maximizes the multi-class margin. Our approach of- fers a few advantages: 1) it is simple and computationally efficient to train. The approach can speed up the training time by more than two orders of magnitude without sacrificing the classification accuracy. 2) Like traditional AdaBoost, it is less sensitive to the choice of parameters and empirically demonstrates excellent generalization performance. Experimental results on challenging multi-class machine learning and vision tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves the convergence rate and accuracy of the final visual detector at no additional computational cost compared to existing multi-class boosting."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose and study a family of sparsity-inducing penalty functions. Since the penalty functions are related to the kinetic energy in special relativity, we call them \\emph{kinetic energy plus} (KEP) functions. We construct the KEP function by using the concave conjugate of a $\\chi^2$-distance function and present several novel insights into the KEP function with $q=1$. In particular, we derive a thresholding operator based on the KEP function, and prove its mathematical properties and asymptotic properties in sparsity modeling. Moreover, we show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for the KEP function. Additionally, we discuss the relationship of KEP with the penalty functions $\\ell_{1/2}$ and MCP. The theoretical and empirical analysis validates that the KEP function is effective and efficient in high-dimensional data modeling."}
{"text": "  In this work, we define cost-free learning (CFL) formally in comparison with cost-sensitive learning (CSL). The main difference between them is that a CFL approach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost information, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL approaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some criteria-based pproaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing CFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications properly when no information is given about errors and rejects. Based on information theory, we propose a novel CFL which seeks to maximize normalized mutual information of the targets and the decision outputs of classifiers. Using the strategy, we can deal with binary/multi-class classifications with/without abstaining. Significant features are observed from the new strategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed strategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and automatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving optimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the \"equivalent\" costs in binary classifications. The connection between rejection thresholds and ROC curve is explored. Empirical investigation is made on several benchmark data sets in comparison with other existing approaches. The classification results demonstrate a promising perspective of the strategy in machine learning."}

KRA Algorithm is based on Contingency Table concepts. Metrics are computed for the Original and Refined Clusters. Quality of Original and Refined Clusters are compared in terms of metrics. The proposed algorithm (KRA) is tested in the educational domain and results show that it generates better quality clusters in terms of improved metric values."}
{"text": "  We consider online learning when the time horizon is unknown. We apply a minimax analysis, beginning with the fixed horizon case, and then moving on to two unknown-horizon settings, one that assumes the horizon is chosen randomly according to some known distribution, and the other which allows the adversary full control over the horizon. For the random horizon setting with restricted losses, we derive a fully optimal minimax algorithm. And for the adversarial horizon setting, we prove a nontrivial lower bound which shows that the adversary obtains strictly more power than when the horizon is fixed and known. Based on the minimax solution of the random horizon setting, we then propose a new adaptive algorithm which \"pretends\" that the horizon is drawn from a distribution from a special family, but no matter how the actual horizon is chosen, the worst-case regret is of the optimal rate. Furthermore, our algorithm can be combined and applied in many ways, for instance, to online convex optimization, follow the perturbed leader, exponential weights algorithm and first order bounds. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms many other existing algorithms in an online linear optimization setting."}
{"text": "  The sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm and variants thereof are the de facto standard method for solving large quadratic programs for support vector machine (SVM) training. In this paper we propose a simple yet powerful modification. The main emphasis is on an algorithm improving the SMO step size by planning-ahead. The theoretical analysis ensures its convergence to the optimum. Experiments involving a large number of datasets were carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the new algorithm."}
{"text": "  In this project we further investigate the idea of reducing the dimensionality of datasets using a Borel isomorphism with the purpose of subsequently applying supervised learning algorithms, as originally suggested by my supervisor V. Pestov (in 2011 Dagstuhl preprint). Any consistent learning algorithm, for example kNN, retains universal consistency after a Borel isomorphism is applied. A series of concrete examples of Borel isomorphisms that reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset is provided, based on multiplying the data by orthogonal matrices before the dimensionality reducing Borel isomorphism is applied. We test the accuracy of the resulting classifier in a lower dimensional space with various data sets. Working with a phoneme voice recognition dataset, of dimension 256 with 5 classes (phonemes), we show that a Borel isomorphic reduction to dimension 16 leads to a minimal drop in accuracy. In conclusion, we discuss further prospects of the method."}
{"text": "  We introduce an application of the group lasso to design of experiments. Note that we are NOT trying to explain experimental design for the group lasso. Conversely, we explain how we can use the idea of the group lasso in experimental design, showing that the problem of constructing an optimal design matrix can be transformed into a problem of the group lasso. In some numerical examples, we show that we can obtain the orthogonal arrays as the solutions of the group lasso problems."}
{"text": "  Big Data bring new opportunities to modern society and challenges to data scientists. On one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity, and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This article give overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasis on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogeneous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data can not be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions."}
{"text": "  Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as Gaussian mixture models, are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. These models consist of observable and latent variables, which represent the observable data and the underlying data-generation process, respectively. Unsupervised learning tasks, such as cluster analysis, are regarded as estimations of latent variables based on the observable ones. The estimation of latent variables in semi-supervised learning, where some labels are observed, will be more precise than that in unsupervised, and one of the concerns is to clarify the effect of the labeled data. However, there has not been sufficient theoretical analysis of the accuracy of the estimation of latent variables. In a previous study, a distribution-based error function was formulated, and its asymptotic form was calculated for unsupervised learning with generative models. It has been shown that, for the estimation of latent variables, the Bayes method is more accurate than the maximum-likelihood method. The present paper reveals the asymptotic forms of the error function in Bayesian semi-supervised learning for both discriminative and generative models. The results show that the generative model, which uses all of the given data, performs better when the model is well specified."}
{"text": "  We study the sample complexity of multiclass prediction in several learning settings. For the PAC setting our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: In sharp contrast to binary classification, we show that there exist multiclass hypothesis classes for which some Empirical Risk Minimizers (ERM learners) have lower sample complexity than others. Furthermore, there are classes that are learnable by some ERM learners, while other ERM learners will fail to learn them. We propose a principle for designing good ERM learners, and use this principle to prove tight bounds on the sample complexity of learning {\\em symmetric} multiclass hypothesis classes---classes that are invariant under permutations of label names. We further provide a characterization of mistake and regret bounds for multiclass learning in the online setting and the bandit setting, using new generalizations of Littlestone's dimension."}
{"text": "  Stochastic neurons and hard non-linearities can be useful for a number of reasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic or non-smooth neurons? I.e., can we \"back-propagate\" through these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing approaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different settings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for stochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second approach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic neuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which approximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first order. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative noise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth approach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic output directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid argument (we call this the straight-through estimator). To explore a context where these estimators are useful, we consider a small-scale version of {\\em conditional computation}, where sparse stochastic units form a distributed representation of gaters that can turn off in combinatorially many ways large chunks of the computation performed in the rest of the neural network. In this case, it is important that the gating units produce an actual 0 most of the time. The resulting sparsity can be potentially be exploited to greatly reduce the computational cost of large deep networks for which conditional computation would be useful."}
{"text": "  It has been found that stochastic algorithms often find good solutions much more rapidly than inherently-batch approaches. Indeed, a very useful rule of thumb is that often, when solving a machine learning problem, an iterative technique which relies on performing a very large number of relatively-inexpensive updates will often outperform one which performs a smaller number of much \"smarter\" but computationally-expensive updates.   In this thesis, we will consider the application of stochastic algorithms to two of the most important machine learning problems. Part i is concerned with the supervised problem of binary classification using kernelized linear classifiers, for which the data have labels belonging to exactly two classes (e.g. \"has cancer\" or \"doesn't have cancer\"), and the learning problem is to find a linear classifier which is best at predicting the label. In Part ii, we will consider the unsupervised problem of Principal Component Analysis, for which the learning task is to find the directions which contain most of the variance of the data distribution.   Our goal is to present stochastic algorithms for both problems which are, above all, practical--they work well on real-world data, in some cases better than all known competing algorithms. A secondary, but still very important, goal is to derive theoretical bounds on the performance of these algorithms which are at least competitive with, and often better than, those known for other approaches."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of predicting a set or list of options under knapsack constraint. The quality of such lists are evaluated by a submodular reward function that measures both quality and diversity. Similar to DAgger (Ross et al., 2010), by a reduction to online learning, we show how to adapt two sequence prediction models to imitate greedy maximization under knapsack constraint problems: CONSEQOPT (Dey et al., 2012) and SCP (Ross et al., 2013). Experiments on extractive multi-document summarization show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Xu, etc. They proposed a theorem to show that it is possible to relate robustness in the feature space and robustness in the sample space directly. In this paper, we propose a counter example that rejects their theorem."}
{"text": "  We propose a general framework for reduced-rank modeling of matrix-valued data. By applying a generalized nuclear norm penalty we can directly model low-dimensional latent variables associated with rows and columns. Our framework flexibly incorporates row and column features, smoothing kernels, and other sources of side information by penalizing deviations from the row and column models. Moreover, a large class of these models can be estimated scalably using convex optimization. The computational bottleneck in each case is one singular value decomposition per iteration of a large but easy-to-apply matrix. Our framework generalizes traditional convex matrix completion and multi-task learning methods as well as maximum a posteriori estimation under a large class of popular hierarchical Bayesian models."}
{"text": "  We present a new algorithm for general reinforcement learning where the true environment is known to belong to a finite class of N arbitrary models. The algorithm is shown to be near-optimal for all but O(N log^2 N) time-steps with high probability. Infinite classes are also considered where we show that compactness is a key criterion for determining the existence of uniform sample-complexity bounds. A matching lower bound is given for the finite case."}
{"text": "  We present an efficient distributed online learning scheme to classify data captured from distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic data sources. Our scheme consists of multiple distributed local learners, that analyze different streams of data that are correlated to a common event that needs to be classified. Each learner uses a local classifier to make a local prediction. The local predictions are then collected by each learner and combined using a weighted majority rule to output the final prediction. We propose a novel online ensemble learning algorithm to update the aggregation rule in order to adapt to the underlying data dynamics. We rigorously determine a bound for the worst case misclassification probability of our algorithm which depends on the misclassification probabilities of the best static aggregation rule, and of the best local classifier. Importantly, the worst case misclassification probability of our algorithm tends asymptotically to 0 if the misclassification probability of the best static aggregation rule or the misclassification probability of the best local classifier tend to 0. Then we extend our algorithm to address challenges specific to the distributed implementation and we prove new bounds that apply to these settings. Finally, we test our scheme by performing an evaluation study on several data sets. When applied to data sets widely used by the literature dealing with dynamic data streams and concept drift, our scheme exhibits performance gains ranging from 34% to 71% with respect to state of the art solutions."}
{"text": "  Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been one of the most popular methods for frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Despite its efficiency, a potential problem is that using pre-constructed sine-cosine waves as the required reference signals in the CCA method often does not result in the optimal recognition accuracy due to their lack of features from the real EEG data. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel method based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (MsetCCA) to optimize the reference signals used in the CCA method for SSVEP frequency recognition. The MsetCCA method learns multiple linear transforms that implement joint spatial filtering to maximize the overall correlation among canonical variates, and hence extracts SSVEP common features from multiple sets of EEG data recorded at the same stimulus frequency. The optimized reference signals are formed by combination of the common features and completely based on training data. Experimental study with EEG data from ten healthy subjects demonstrates that the MsetCCA method improves the recognition accuracy of SSVEP frequency in comparison with the CCA method and other two competing methods (multiway CCA (MwayCCA) and phase constrained CCA (PCCA)), especially for a small number of channels and a short time window length. The superiority indicates that the proposed MsetCCA method is a new promising candidate for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCIs."}
{"text": "  Reshef & Reshef recently published a paper in which they present a method called the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) that can detect all forms of statistical dependence between pairs of variables as sample size goes to infinity. While this method has been praised by some, it has also been criticized for its lack of power in finite samples. We seek to modify MIC so that it has higher power in detecting associations for limited sample sizes. Here we present the Generalized Mean Information Coefficient (GMIC), a generalization of MIC which incorporates a tuning parameter that can be used to modify the complexity of the association favored by the measure. We define GMIC and prove it maintains several key asymptotic properties of MIC. Its increased power over MIC is demonstrated using a simulation of eight different functional relationships at sixty different noise levels. The results are compared to the Pearson correlation, distance correlation, and MIC. Simulation results suggest that while generally GMIC has slightly lower power than the distance correlation measure, it achieves higher power than MIC for many forms of underlying association. For some functional relationships, GMIC surpasses all other statistics calculated. Preliminary results suggest choosing a moderate value of the tuning parameter for GMIC will yield a test that is robust across underlying relationships. GMIC is a promising new method that mitigates the power issues suffered by MIC, at the possible expense of equitability. Nonetheless, distance correlation was in our simulations more powerful for many forms of underlying relationships. At a minimum, this work motivates further consideration of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) methods as statistical tests of independence."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we apply Classification Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ClassRBM) to the problem of predicting breast cancer recurrence. According to the Polish National Cancer Registry, in 2010 only, the breast cancer caused almost 25% of all diagnosed cases of cancer in Poland. We propose how to use ClassRBM for predicting breast cancer return and discovering relevant inputs (symptoms) in illness reappearance. Next, we outline a general probabilistic framework for learning Boltzmann machines with masks, which we refer to as Dropping. The fashion of generating masks leads to different learning methods, i.e., DropOut, DropConnect. We propose a new method called DropPart which is a generalization of DropConnect. In DropPart the Beta distribution instead of Bernoulli distribution in DropConnect is used. At the end, we carry out an experiment using real-life dataset consisting of 949 cases, provided by the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana."}
{"text": "  In this work we consider the problem of learning a positive semidefinite kernel matrix from relative comparisons of the form: \"object A is more similar to object B than it is to C\", where comparisons are given by humans. Existing solutions to this problem assume many comparisons are provided to learn a high quality kernel. However, this can be considered unrealistic for many real-world tasks since relative assessments require human input, which is often costly or difficult to obtain. Because of this, only a limited number of these comparisons may be provided. In this work, we explore methods for aiding the process of learning a kernel with the help of auxiliary kernels built from more easily extractable information regarding the relationships among objects. We propose a new kernel learning approach in which the target kernel is defined as a conic combination of auxiliary kernels and a kernel whose elements are learned directly. We formulate a convex optimization to solve for this target kernel that adds only minor overhead to methods that use no auxiliary information. Empirical results show that in the presence of few training relative comparisons, our method can learn kernels that generalize to more out-of-sample comparisons than methods that do not utilize auxiliary information, as well as similar methods that learn metrics over objects."}
{"text": "  We describe ways to define and calculate $L_1$-norm signal subspaces which are less sensitive to outlying data than $L_2$-calculated subspaces. We focus on the computation of the $L_1$ maximum-projection principal component of a data matrix containing N signal samples of dimension D and conclude that the general problem is formally NP-hard in asymptotically large N, D. We prove, however, that the case of engineering interest of fixed dimension D and asymptotically large sample support N is not and we present an optimal algorithm of complexity $O(N^D)$. We generalize to multiple $L_1$-max-projection components and present an explicit optimal $L_1$ subspace calculation algorithm in the form of matrix nuclear-norm evaluations. We conclude with illustrations of $L_1$-subspace signal processing in the fields of data dimensionality reduction and direction-of-arrival estimation."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the problem of subspace clustering under noise. Specifically, we study the behavior of Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) when either adversarial or random noise is added to the unlabelled input data points, which are assumed to be in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. We show that a modified version of SSC is \\emph{provably effective} in correctly identifying the underlying subspaces, even with noisy data. This extends theoretical guarantee of this algorithm to more practical settings and provides justification to the success of SSC in a class of real applications."}
{"text": "  Spectral clustering is sensitive to how graphs are constructed from data particularly when proximal and imbalanced clusters are present. We show that Ratio-Cut (RCut) or normalized cut (NCut) objectives are not tailored to imbalanced data since they tend to emphasize cut sizes over cut values. We propose a graph partitioning problem that seeks minimum cut partitions under minimum size constraints on partitions to deal with imbalanced data. Our approach parameterizes a family of graphs, by adaptively modulating node degrees on a fixed node set, to yield a set of parameter dependent cuts reflecting varying levels of imbalance. The solution to our problem is then obtained by optimizing over these parameters. We present rigorous limit cut analysis results to justify our approach. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "  Regularized variants of Principal Components Analysis, especially Sparse PCA and Functional PCA, are among the most useful tools for the analysis of complex high-dimensional data. Many examples of massive data, have both sparse and functional (smooth) aspects and may benefit from a regularization scheme that can capture both forms of structure. For example, in neuro-imaging data, the brain's response to a stimulus may be restricted to a discrete region of activation (spatial sparsity), while exhibiting a smooth response within that region. We propose a unified approach to regularized PCA which can induce both sparsity and smoothness in both the row and column principal components. Our framework generalizes much of the previous literature, with sparse, functional, two-way sparse, and two-way functional PCA all being special cases of our approach. Our method permits flexible combinations of sparsity and smoothness that lead to improvements in feature selection and signal recovery, as well as more interpretable PCA factors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on simulated data and a neuroimaging example on EEG data."}
{"text": "  We analyze the following group learning problem in the context of opinion diffusion: Consider a network with $M$ users, each facing $N$ options. In a discrete time setting, at each time step, each user chooses $K$ out of the $N$ options, and receive randomly generated rewards, whose statistics depend on the options chosen as well as the user itself, and are unknown to the users. Each user aims to maximize their expected total rewards over a certain time horizon through an online learning process, i.e., a sequence of exploration (sampling the return of each option) and exploitation (selecting empirically good options) steps.   Within this context we consider two group learning scenarios, (1) users with uniform preferences and (2) users with diverse preferences, and examine how a user should construct its learning process to best extract information from other's decisions and experiences so as to maximize its own reward. Performance is measured in {\\em weak regret}, the difference between the user's total reward and the reward from a user-specific best single-action policy (i.e., always selecting the set of options generating the highest mean rewards for this user). Within each scenario we also consider two cases: (i) when users exchange full information, meaning they share the actual rewards they obtained from their choices, and (ii) when users exchange limited information, e.g., only their choices but not rewards obtained from these choices."}
{"text": "  Most metric learning algorithms, as well as Fisher's Discriminant Analysis (FDA), optimize some cost function of different measures of within-and between-class distances. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and several Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithms are based on the SVM large margin theory. Recently, SVMs have been analyzed from SVM and metric learning, and to develop new algorithms that build on the strengths of each. Inspired by the metric learning interpretation of SVM, we develop here a new metric-learning based SVM framework in which we incorporate metric learning concepts within SVM. We extend the optimization problem of SVM to include some measure of the within-class distance and along the way we develop a new within-class distance measure which is appropriate for SVM. In addition, we adopt the same approach for MKL and show that it can be also formulated as a Mahalanobis metric learning problem. Our end result is a number of SVM/MKL algorithms that incorporate metric learning concepts. We experiment with them on a set of benchmark datasets and observe important predictive performance improvements."}
{"text": "  We informally call a stochastic process learnable if it admits a generalization error approaching zero in probability for any concept class with finite VC-dimension (IID processes are the simplest example). A mixture of learnable processes need not be learnable itself, and certainly its generalization error need not decay at the same rate. In this paper, we argue that it is natural in predictive PAC to condition not on the past observations but on the mixture component of the sample path. This definition not only matches what a realistic learner might demand, but also allows us to sidestep several otherwise grave problems in learning from dependent data. In particular, we give a novel PAC generalization bound for mixtures of learnable processes with a generalization error that is not worse than that of each mixture component. We also provide a characterization of mixtures of absolutely regular ($\\beta$-mixing) processes, of independent probability-theoretic interest."}
{"text": "  Recently a majorization method for optimizing partition functions of log-linear models was proposed alongside a novel quadratic variational upper-bound. In the batch setting, it outperformed state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimization methods on various learning tasks. We propose a stochastic version of this bound majorization method as well as a low-rank modification for high-dimensional data-sets. The resulting stochastic second-order method outperforms stochastic gradient descent (across variations and various tunings) both in terms of the number of iterations and computation time till convergence while finding a better quality parameter setting. The proposed method bridges first- and second-order stochastic optimization methods by maintaining a computational complexity that is linear in the data dimension and while exploiting second order information about the pseudo-global curvature of the objective function (as opposed to the local curvature in the Hessian)."}
{"text": "  We present a numerical algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problems under noisy separability. An NMF problem under separability can be stated as one of finding all vertices of the convex hull of data points. The research interest of this paper is to find the vectors as close to the vertices as possible in a situation in which noise is added to the data points. Our algorithm is designed to capture the shape of the convex hull of data points by using its enclosing ellipsoid. We show that the algorithm has correctness and robustness properties from theoretical and practical perspectives; correctness here means that if the data points do not contain any noise, the algorithm can find the vertices of their convex hull; robustness means that if the data points contain noise, the algorithm can find the near-vertices. Finally, we apply the algorithm to document clustering, and report the experimental results."}
{"text": "  Learning a distance metric from the given training samples plays a crucial role in many machine learning tasks, and various models and optimization algorithms have been proposed in the past decade. In this paper, we generalize several state-of-the-art metric learning methods, such as large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) and information theoretic metric learning (ITML), into a kernel classification framework. First, doublets and triplets are constructed from the training samples, and a family of degree-2 polynomial kernel functions are proposed for pairs of doublets or triplets. Then, a kernel classification framework is established, which can not only generalize many popular metric learning methods such as LMNN and ITML, but also suggest new metric learning methods, which can be efficiently implemented, interestingly, by using the standard support vector machine (SVM) solvers. Two novel metric learning methods, namely doublet-SVM and triplet-SVM, are then developed under the proposed framework. Experimental results show that doublet-SVM and triplet-SVM achieve competitive classification accuracies with state-of-the-art metric learning methods such as ITML and LMNN but with significantly less training time."}
{"text": "  We describe a primal-dual framework for the design and analysis of online convex optimization algorithms for {\\em drifting regret}. Existing literature shows (nearly) optimal drifting regret bounds only for the $\\ell_2$ and the $\\ell_1$-norms. Our work provides a connection between these algorithms and the Online Mirror Descent ($\\omd$) updates; one key insight that results from our work is that in order for these algorithms to succeed, it suffices to have the gradient of the regularizer to be bounded (in an appropriate norm). For situations (like for the $\\ell_1$ norm) where the vanilla regularizer does not have this property, we have to {\\em shift} the regularizer to ensure this. Thus, this helps explain the various updates presented in \\cite{bansal10, buchbinder12}. We also consider the online variant of the problem with 1-lookahead, and with movement costs in the $\\ell_2$-norm. Our primal dual approach yields nearly optimal competitive ratios for this problem."}
{"text": "  Theory of graphical models has matured over more than three decades to provide the backbone for several classes of models that are used in a myriad of applications such as genetic mapping of diseases, credit risk evaluation, reliability and computer security, etc. Despite of their generic applicability and wide adoptance, the constraints imposed by undirected graphical models and Bayesian networks have also been recognized to be unnecessarily stringent under certain circumstances. This observation has led to the proposal of several generalizations that aim at more relaxed constraints by which the models can impose local or context-specific dependence structures. Here we consider an additional class of such models, termed as stratified graphical models. We develop a method for Bayesian learning of these models by deriving an analytical expression for the marginal likelihood of data under a specific subclass of decomposable stratified models. A non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is further used to identify models that are highly supported by the posterior distribution over the model space. Our method is illustrated and compared with ordinary graphical models through application to several real and synthetic datasets."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of learning causal directed acyclic graphs from an observational joint distribution. One can use these graphs to predict the outcome of interventional experiments, from which data are often not available. We show that if the observational distribution follows a structural equation model with an additive noise structure, the directed acyclic graph becomes identifiable from the distribution under mild conditions. This constitutes an interesting alternative to traditional methods that assume faithfulness and identify only the Markov equivalence class of the graph, thus leaving some edges undirected. We provide practical algorithms for finitely many samples, RESIT (Regression with Subsequent Independence Test) and two methods based on an independence score. We prove that RESIT is correct in the population setting and provide an empirical evaluation."}
{"text": "  In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efficiently from Gibbs distributions. Specifically, we provide means for drawing either approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs' distributions by introducing low dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions. We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical \"high signal - high coupling\" regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds."}
{"text": "  The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification algorithm is one of the most widely-used lazy classifiers because of its simplicity and ease of implementation. It is considered to be an effective classifier and has many applications. However, its major drawback is that when sequential search is used to find the neighbors, it involves high computational cost. Speeding-up k-NN search is still an active research field. Hwang and Cho have recently proposed an adaptive cluster-based method for fast Nearest Neighbor searching. The effectiveness of this method is based on the adjustment of three parameters. However, the authors evaluated their method by setting specific parameter values and using only one dataset. In this paper, an extensive experimental study of this method is presented. The results, which are based on five real life datasets, illustrate that if the parameters of the method are carefully defined, one can achieve even better classification performance."}
{"text": "  This article proposes Multinomial Probit Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (MPBART) as a multinomial probit extension of BART - Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (Chipman et al (2010)). MPBART is flexible to allow inclusion of predictors that describe the observed units as well as the available choice alternatives. Through two simulation studies and four real data examples, we show that MPBART exhibits very good predictive performance in comparison to other discrete choice and multiclass classification methods. To implement MPBART, we have developed an R package mpbart available freely from CRAN repositories."}
{"text": "  With the increasing number of mobile Apps developed, they are now closely integrated into daily life. In this paper, we develop a framework to predict mobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status of a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial prerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power management of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover two kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of built-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The IF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated as AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to discover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage behaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature selection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the training data and select those features which need less length to describe the training data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the log size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification model to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the proposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these features, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of dimensionality when using the kNN classifier. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study based on a real mobile App usage dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the predictive capability for App usage prediction."}
{"text": "  In standard clustering problems, data points are represented by vectors, and by stacking them together, one forms a data matrix with row or column cluster structure. In this paper, we consider a class of binary matrices, arising in many applications, which exhibit both row and column cluster structure, and our goal is to exactly recover the underlying row and column clusters by observing only a small fraction of noisy entries. We first derive a lower bound on the minimum number of observations needed for exact cluster recovery. Then, we propose three algorithms with different running time and compare the number of observations needed by them for successful cluster recovery. Our analytical results show smooth time-data trade-offs: one can gradually reduce the computational complexity when increasingly more observations are available."}
{"text": "  Vertex clustering in a stochastic blockmodel graph has wide applicability and has been the subject of extensive research. In thispaper, we provide a short proof that the adjacency spectral embedding can be used to obtain perfect clustering for the stochastic blockmodel and the degree-corrected stochastic blockmodel. We also show an analogous result for the more general random dot product graph model."}
{"text": "  Multiple datasets containing different types of features may be available for a given task. For instance, users' profiles can be used to group users for recommendation systems. In addition, a model can also use users' historical behaviors and credit history to group users. Each dataset contains different information and suffices for learning. A number of clustering algorithms on multiple datasets were proposed during the past few years. These algorithms assume that at least one dataset is complete. So far as we know, all the previous methods will not be applicable if there is no complete dataset available. However, in reality, there are many situations where no dataset is complete. As in building a recommendation system, some new users may not have a profile or historical behaviors, while some may not have a credit history. Hence, no available dataset is complete. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach called Collective Kernel Learning to infer hidden sample similarity from multiple incomplete datasets. The idea is to collectively completes the kernel matrices of incomplete datasets by optimizing the alignment of the shared instances of the datasets. Furthermore, a clustering algorithm is proposed based on the kernel matrix. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed clustering algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms by as much as two times in normalized mutual information."}
{"text": "  The most important aspect of any classifier is its error rate, because this quantifies its predictive capacity. Thus, the accuracy of error estimation is critical. Error estimation is problematic in small-sample classifier design because the error must be estimated using the same data from which the classifier has been designed. Use of prior knowledge, in the form of a prior distribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions to which the true, but unknown, feature-distribution belongs, can facilitate accurate error estimation (in the mean-square sense) in circumstances where accurate completely model-free error estimation is impossible. This paper provides analytic asymptotically exact finite-sample approximations for various performance metrics of the resulting Bayesian Minimum Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) error estimator in the case of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the multivariate Gaussian model. These performance metrics include the first, second, and cross moments of the Bayesian MMSE error estimator with the true error of LDA, and therefore, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of the estimator. We lay down the theoretical groundwork for Kolmogorov double-asymptotics in a Bayesian setting, which enables us to derive asymptotic expressions of the desired performance metrics. From these we produce analytic finite-sample approximations and demonstrate their accuracy via numerical examples. Various examples illustrate the behavior of these approximations and their use in determining the necessary sample size to achieve a desired RMS. The Supplementary Material contains derivations for some equations and added figures."}
{"text": "  We proposed a new statistical dependency measure called Copula Dependency Coefficient(CDC) for two sets of variables based on copula. It is robust to outliers, easy to implement, powerful and appropriate to high-dimensional variables. These properties are important in many applications. Experimental results show that CDC can detect the dependence between variables in both additive and non-additive models."}
{"text": "  Significant success has been reported recently using deep neural networks for classification. Such large networks can be computationally intensive, even after training is over. Implementing these trained networks in hardware chips with a limited precision of synaptic weights may improve their speed and energy efficiency by several orders of magnitude, thus enabling their integration into small and low-power electronic devices. With this motivation, we develop a computationally efficient learning algorithm for multilayer neural networks with binary weights, assuming all the hidden neurons have a fan-out of one. This algorithm, derived within a Bayesian probabilistic online setting, is shown to work well for both synthetic and real-world problems, performing comparably to algorithms with real-valued weights, while retaining computational tractability."}
{"text": "  In many real-world tasks, particularly those involving data objects with complicated semantics such as images and texts, one object can be represented by multiple instances and simultaneously be associated with multiple labels. Such tasks can be formulated as multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) problems, and have been extensively studied during the past few years. Existing MIML approaches have been found useful in many applications; however, most of them can only handle moderate-sized data. To efficiently handle large data sets, in this paper we propose the MIMLfast approach, which first constructs a low-dimensional subspace shared by all labels, and then trains label specific linear models to optimize approximated ranking loss via stochastic gradient descent. Although the MIML problem is complicated, MIMLfast is able to achieve excellent performance by exploiting label relations with shared space and discovering sub-concepts for complicated labels. Experiments show that the performance of MIMLfast is highly competitive to state-of-the-art techniques, whereas its time cost is much less; particularly, on a data set with 20K bags and 180K instances, MIMLfast is more than 100 times faster than existing MIML approaches. On a larger data set where none of existing approaches can return results in 24 hours, MIMLfast takes only 12 minutes. Moreover, our approach is able to identify the most representative instance for each label, and thus providing a chance to understand the relation between input patterns and output label semantics."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present two localized graph filtering based methods for interpolating graph signals defined on the vertices of arbitrary graphs from only a partial set of samples. The first method is an extension of previous work on reconstructing bandlimited graph signals from partially observed samples. The iterative graph filtering approach very closely approximates the solution proposed in the that work, while being computationally more efficient. As an alternative, we propose a regularization based framework in which we define the cost of reconstruction to be a combination of smoothness of the graph signal and the reconstruction error with respect to the known samples, and find solutions that minimize this cost. We provide both a closed form solution and a computationally efficient iterative solution of the optimization problem. The experimental results on the recommendation system datasets demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed methods."}
{"text": "  Graph-based Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully used in a large number of applications. These methods classify initially unlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph starting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly with the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node. Unfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with very large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In this paper, we propose MAD-SKETCH, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which compactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a randomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under mild conditions, MAD-SKETCH can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m) to O(log m), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe that MAD-SKETCH achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art graph- based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at the same time achieving up to 10x speedup. We find that MAD-SKETCH is able to scale to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of existing graph- based SSL algorithms."}
{"text": "  A novel linear classification method that possesses the merits of both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Distance-weighted Discrimination (DWD) is proposed in this article. The proposed Distance-weighted Support Vector Machine method can be viewed as a hybrid of SVM and DWD that finds the classification direction by minimizing mainly the DWD loss, and determines the intercept term in the SVM manner. We show that our method inheres the merit of DWD, and hence, overcomes the data-piling and overfitting issue of SVM. On the other hand, the new method is not subject to imbalanced data issue which was a main advantage of SVM over DWD. It uses an unusual loss which combines the Hinge loss (of SVM) and the DWD loss through a trick of axillary hyperplane. Several theoretical properties, including Fisher consistency and asymptotic normality of the DWSVM solution are developed. We use some simulated examples to show that the new method can compete DWD and SVM on both classification performance and interpretability. A real data application further establishes the usefulness of our approach."}
{"text": "  Classification is an important topic in statistics and machine learning with great potential in many real applications. In this paper, we investigate two popular large margin classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), under two contexts: the high-dimensional, low-sample size data and the imbalanced data. A unified family of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to identify the similarities and differences between SVM and DWD. It is well known that many classifiers overfit the data in the high-dimensional setting; and others are sensitive to the imbalanced data, that is, the class with a larger sample size overly influences the classifier and pushes the decision boundary towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to the imbalanced data issue, but it overfits high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling phenomena. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the high-dimensional setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to the imbalanced ratio of sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection between SVM and DWD, and improves both methods by providing a better trade-off between sensitivity to the imbalanced data and overfitting the high-dimensional data. Several asymptotic properties of the FLAME classifiers are studied. Simulations and real data applications are investigated to illustrate the usefulness of the FLAME classifiers."}
{"text": "  We present a robust alternative to principal component analysis (PCA) --- called elliptical component analysis (ECA) --- for analyzing high dimensional, elliptically distributed data. ECA estimates the eigenspace of the covariance matrix of the elliptical data. To cope with heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, a multivariate rank statistic is exploited. At the model-level, we consider two settings: either that the leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are non-sparse or that they are sparse. Methodologically, we propose ECA procedures for both non-sparse and sparse settings. Theoretically, we provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic analyses quantifying the theoretical performances of ECA. In the non-sparse setting, we show that ECA's performance is highly related to the effective rank of the covariance matrix. In the sparse setting, the results are twofold: (i) We show that the sparse ECA estimator based on a combinatoric program attains the optimal rate of convergence; (ii) Based on some recent developments in estimating sparse leading eigenvectors, we show that a computationally efficient sparse ECA estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence under a suboptimal scaling."}
{"text": "  Mixed linear regression involves the recovery of two (or more) unknown vectors from unlabeled linear measurements; that is, where each sample comes from exactly one of the vectors, but we do not know which one. It is a classic problem, and the natural and empirically most popular approach to its solution has been the EM algorithm. As in other settings, this is prone to bad local minima; however, each iteration is very fast (alternating between guessing labels, and solving with those labels).   In this paper we provide a new initialization procedure for EM, based on finding the leading two eigenvectors of an appropriate matrix. We then show that with this, a re-sampled version of the EM algorithm provably converges to the correct vectors, under natural assumptions on the sampling distribution, and with nearly optimal (unimprovable) sample complexity. This provides not only the first characterization of EM's performance, but also much lower sample complexity as compared to both standard (randomly initialized) EM, and other methods for this problem."}
{"text": "  We present new algorithms to compute the mean of a set of empirical probability measures under the optimal transport metric. This mean, known as the Wasserstein barycenter, is the measure that minimizes the sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We propose two original algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters that build upon the subgradient method. A direct implementation of these algorithms is, however, too costly because it would require the repeated resolution of large primal and dual optimal transport problems to compute subgradients. Extending the work of Cuturi (2013), we propose to smooth the Wasserstein distance used in the definition of Wasserstein barycenters with an entropic regularizer and recover in doing so a strictly convex objective whose gradients can be computed for a considerably cheaper computational cost using matrix scaling algorithms. We use these algorithms to visualize a large family of images and to solve a constrained clustering problem."}
{"text": "  We present a general framework to learn functions in tensor product reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (TP-RKHSs). The methodology is based on a novel representer theorem suitable for existing as well as new spectral penalties for tensors. When the functions in the TP-RKHS are defined on the Cartesian product of finite discrete sets, in particular, our main problem formulation admits as a special case existing tensor completion problems. Other special cases include transfer learning with multimodal side information and multilinear multitask learning. For the latter case, our kernel-based view is instrumental to derive nonlinear extensions of existing model classes. We give a novel algorithm and show in experiments the usefulness of the proposed extensions."}
{"text": "  We consider the multiarm bandit problems in the timevarying dynamic system for rich structural features. For the nonlinear dynamic model, we propose the approximate inference for the posterior distributions based on Laplace Approximation. For the context bandit problems, Thompson Sampling is adopted based on the underlying posterior distributions of the parameters. More specifically, we introduce the discount decays on the previous samples impact and analyze the different decay rates with the underlying sample dynamics. Consequently, the exploration and exploitation is adaptively tradeoff according to the dynamics in the system."}
{"text": "  Clustering trajectory data attracted considerable attention in the last few years. Most of prior work assumed that moving objects can move freely in an euclidean space and did not consider the eventual presence of an underlying road network and its influence on evaluating the similarity between trajectories. In this paper, we present an approach to clustering such network-constrained trajectory data. More precisely we aim at discovering groups of road segments that are often travelled by the same trajectories. To achieve this end, we model the interactions between segments w.r.t. their similarity as a weighted graph to which we apply a community detection algorithm to discover meaningful clusters. We showcase our proposition through experimental results obtained on synthetic datasets."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose a multi-task linear classifier learning problem called D-SVM (Dictionary SVM). D-SVM uses a dictionary of parameter covariance shared by all tasks to do multi-task knowledge transfer among different tasks. We formally define the learning problem of D-SVM and show two interpretations of this problem, from both the probabilistic and kernel perspectives. From the probabilistic perspective, we show that our learning formulation is actually a MAP estimation on all optimization variables. We also show its equivalence to a multiple kernel learning problem in which one is trying to find a re-weighting kernel for features from a dictionary of basis (despite the fact that only linear classifiers are learned). Finally, we describe an alternative optimization scheme to minimize the objective function and present empirical studies to valid our algorithm."}
{"text": "  Substantial evidence indicates that major psychiatric disorders are associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to strong interest in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder status. In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the GraphNet regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or GraphNet regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and GraphNet regularized SVM with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D \"connectome space,\" offering an additional layer of interpretability that could provide new insights about various disease processes."}

{"text": "  Kernel methods have been widely applied to machine learning and other questions of approximating an unknown function from its finite sample data. To ensure arbitrary accuracy of such approximation, various denseness conditions are imposed on the selected kernel. This note contributes to the study of universal, characteristic, and $C_0$-universal kernels. We first give simple and direct description of the difference and relation among these three kinds of universalities of kernels. We then focus on translation-invariant and weighted polynomial kernels. A simple and shorter proof of the known characterization of characteristic translation-invariant kernels will be presented. The main purpose of the note is to give a delicate discussion on the universalities of weighted polynomial kernels."}
{"text": "  Second-price auctions with reserve play a critical role for modern search engine and popular online sites since the revenue of these companies often directly de- pends on the outcome of such auctions. The choice of the reserve price is the main mechanism through which the auction revenue can be influenced in these electronic markets. We cast the problem of selecting the reserve price to optimize revenue as a learning problem and present a full theoretical analysis dealing with the complex properties of the corresponding loss function. We further give novel algorithms for solving this problem and report the results of several experiments in both synthetic and real data demonstrating their effectiveness."}
{"text": "  We consider discrete graphical models Markov with respect to a graph $G$ and propose two distributed marginal methods to estimate the maximum likelihood estimate of the canonical parameter of the model. Both methods are based on a relaxation of the marginal likelihood obtained by considering the density of the variables represented by a vertex $v$ of $G$ and a neighborhood. The two methods differ by the size of the neighborhood of $v$. We show that the estimates are consistent and that those obtained with the larger neighborhood have smaller asymptotic variance than the ones obtained through the smaller neighborhood."}
{"text": "  We present an extensive analysis of relative deviation bounds, including detailed proofs of two-sided inequalities and their implications. We also give detailed proofs of two-sided generalization bounds that hold in the general case of unbounded loss functions, under the assumption that a moment of the loss is bounded. These bounds are useful in the analysis of importance weighting and other learning tasks such as unbounded regression."}
{"text": "  We propose an efficient optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression. The algorithm estimates an inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective, either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. The space and time complexity are linear in training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical evaluation shows state-of-art performance in discrete cases and competitive results in the continuous case."}
{"text": "  We introduce a computationally effective algorithm for a linear model selection consisting of three steps: screening--ordering--selection (SOS). Screening of predictors is based on the thresholded Lasso that is l_1 penalized least squares. The screened predictors are then fitted using least squares (LS) and ordered with respect to their t statistics. Finally, a model is selected using greedy generalized information criterion (GIC) that is l_0 penalized LS in a nested family induced by the ordering. We give non-asymptotic upper bounds on error probability of each step of the SOS algorithm in terms of both penalties. Then we obtain selection consistency for different (n, p) scenarios under conditions which are needed for screening consistency of the Lasso. For the traditional setting (n >p) we give Sanov-type bounds on the error probabilities of the ordering--selection algorithm. Its surprising consequence is that the selection error of greedy GIC is asymptotically not larger than of exhaustive GIC. We also obtain new bounds on prediction and estimation errors for the Lasso which are proved in parallel for the algorithm used in practice and its formal version."}
{"text": "  Combining information from different sources is a common way to improve classification accuracy in Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI). For instance, in small sample settings it is useful to integrate data from other subjects or sessions in order to improve the estimation quality of the spatial filters or the classifier. Since data from different subjects may show large variability, it is crucial to weight the contributions according to importance. Many multi-subject learning algorithms determine the optimal weighting in a separate step by using heuristics, however, without ensuring that the selected weights are optimal with respect to classification. In this work we apply Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to this problem. MKL has been widely used for feature fusion in computer vision and allows to simultaneously learn the classifier and the optimal weighting. We compare the MKL method to two baseline approaches and investigate the reasons for performance improvement."}

Our algorithm leverages both structured and unstructured random projections to retain good accuracy while being computationally efficient. We demonstrate the technique on the winning submission the KDD 2010 Cup."}
{"text": "  Latent force models (LFM) are principled approaches to incorporating solutions to differential equations within non-parametric inference methods. Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model."}
{"text": "  We consider learning the possible causal direction of two observed variables in the presence of latent confounding variables. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate causal direction assuming linear or some type of nonlinear relationship and no latent confounders. However, the estimation results could be distorted if either assumption is actually violated. In this paper, we first propose a new linear non-Gaussian acyclic structural equation model with individual-specific effects that allows latent confounders to be considered. We then propose an empirical Bayesian approach for estimating possible causal direction using the new model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial and real-world data."}
{"text": "  Sophisticated automatic incident detection (AID) technology plays a key role in contemporary transportation systems. Though many papers were devoted to study incident classification algorithms, few study investigated how to enhance feature representation of incidents to improve AID performance. In this paper, we propose to use an unsupervised feature learning algorithm to generate higher level features to represent incidents. We used real incident data in the experiments and found that effective feature mapping function can be learnt from the data crosses the test sites. With the enhanced features, detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR) and mean time to detect (MTTD) are significantly improved in all of the three representative cases. This approach also provides an alternative way to reduce the amount of labeled data, which is expensive to obtain, required in training better incident classifiers since the feature learning is unsupervised."}
{"text": "  We explore the performance of several automatic bandwidth selectors, originally designed for density gradient estimation, as data-based procedures for nonparametric, modal clustering. The key tool to obtain a clustering from density gradient estimators is the mean shift algorithm, which allows to obtain a partition not only of the data sample, but also of the whole space. The results of our simulation study suggest that most of the methods considered here, like cross validation and plug in bandwidth selectors, are useful for cluster analysis via the mean shift algorithm."}
{"text": "  Scalable machine learning over big data is an important problem that is receiving a lot of attention in recent years. On popular distributed environments such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity machines, communication costs are substantial and algorithms need to be designed suitably considering those costs. In this paper we give a novel approach to the distributed training of linear classifiers (involving smooth losses and L2 regularization) that is designed to reduce the total communication costs. At each iteration, the nodes minimize locally formed approximate objective functions; then the resulting minimizers are combined to form a descent direction to move. Our approach gives a lot of freedom in the formation of the approximate objective function as well as in the choice of methods to solve them. The method is shown to have $O(log(1/\\epsilon))$ time convergence. The method can be viewed as an iterative parameter mixing method. A special instantiation yields a parallel stochastic gradient descent method with strong convergence. When communication times between nodes are large, our method is much faster than the Terascale method (Agarwal et al., 2011), which is a state of the art distributed solver based on the statistical query model (Chuet al., 2006) that computes function and gradient values in a distributed fashion. We also evaluate against other recent distributed methods and demonstrate superior performance of our method."}
{"text": "  We present new methods for multilabel classification, relying on ensemble learning on a collection of random output graphs imposed on the multilabel and a kernel-based structured output learner as the base classifier. For ensemble learning, differences among the output graphs provide the required base classifier diversity and lead to improved performance in the increasing size of the ensemble. We study different methods of forming the ensemble prediction, including majority voting and two methods that perform inferences over the graph structures before or after combining the base models into the ensemble. We compare the methods against the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches on a set of heterogeneous multilabel benchmark problems, including multilabel AdaBoost, convex multitask feature learning, as well as single target learning approaches represented by Bagging and SVM. In our experiments, the random graph ensembles are very competitive and robust, ranking first or second on most of the datasets. Overall, our results show that random graph ensembles are viable alternatives to flat multilabel and multitask learners."}
{"text": "  Incorporating spatial information into hyperspectral unmixing procedures has been shown to have positive effects, due to the inherent spatial-spectral duality in hyperspectral scenes. Current research works that consider spatial information are mainly focused on the linear mixing model. In this paper, we investigate a variational approach to incorporating spatial correlation into a nonlinear unmixing procedure. A nonlinear algorithm operating in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, associated with an $\\ell_1$ local variation norm as the spatial regularizer, is derived. Experimental results, with both synthetic and real data, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."}
{"text": "  The kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm is an appealing tool for online identification of nonlinear systems due to its simplicity and robustness. In addition to choosing a reproducing kernel and setting filter parameters, designing a KLMS adaptive filter requires to select a so-called dictionary in order to get a finite-order model. This dictionary has a significant impact on performance, and requires careful consideration. Theoretical analysis of KLMS as a function of dictionary setting has rarely, if ever, been addressed in the literature. In an analysis previously published by the authors, the dictionary elements were assumed to be governed by the same probability density function of the input data. In this paper, we modify this study by considering the dictionary as part of the filter parameters to be set. This theoretical analysis paves the way for future investigations on KLMS dictionary design."}
{"text": "  Pattern recognition techniques have been employed in a myriad of industrial, medical, commercial and academic applications. To tackle such a diversity of data, many techniques have been devised. However, despite the long tradition of pattern recognition research, there is no technique that yields the best classification in all scenarios. Therefore, the consideration of as many as possible techniques presents itself as an fundamental practice in applications aiming at high accuracy. Typical works comparing methods either emphasize the performance of a given algorithm in validation tests or systematically compare various algorithms, assuming that the practical use of these methods is done by experts. In many occasions, however, researchers have to deal with their practical classification tasks without an in-depth knowledge about the underlying mechanisms behind parameters. Actually, the adequate choice of classifiers and parameters alike in such practical circumstances constitutes a long-standing problem and is the subject of the current paper. We carried out a study on the performance of nine well-known classifiers implemented by the Weka framework and compared the dependence of the accuracy with their configuration parameter configurations. The analysis of performance with default parameters revealed that the k-nearest neighbors method exceeds by a large margin the other methods when high dimensional datasets are considered. When other configuration of parameters were allowed, we found that it is possible to improve the quality of SVM in more than 20% even if parameters are set randomly. Taken together, the investigation conducted in this paper suggests that, apart from the SVM implementation, Weka's default configuration of parameters provides an performance close the one achieved with the optimal configuration."}
{"text": "  In this manuscript we consider the problem of jointly estimating multiple graphical models in high dimensions. We assume that the data are collected from n subjects, each of which consists of T possibly dependent observations. The graphical models of subjects vary, but are assumed to change smoothly corresponding to a measure of closeness between subjects. We propose a kernel based method for jointly estimating all graphical models. Theoretically, under a double asymptotic framework, where both (T,n) and the dimension d can increase, we provide the explicit rate of convergence in parameter estimation. It characterizes the strength one can borrow across different individuals and impact of data dependence on parameter estimation. Empirically, experiments on both synthetic and real resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  We propose a family of multivariate Gaussian process models for correlated outputs, based on assuming that the likelihood function takes the generic form of the multivariate exponential family distribution (EFD). We denote this model as a multivariate generalized Gaussian process model, and derive Taylor and Laplace algorithms for approximate inference on the generic model. By instantiating the EFD with specific parameter functions, we obtain two novel GP models (and corresponding inference algorithms) for correlated outputs: 1) a Von-Mises GP for angle regression; and 2) a Dirichlet GP for regressing on the multinomial simplex."}
{"text": "  We propose a new stochastic dual coordinate ascent technique that can be applied to a wide range of regularized learning problems. Our method is based on Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) to deal with complex regularization functions such as structured regularizations. Although the original ADMM is a batch method, the proposed method offers a stochastic update rule where each iteration requires only one or few sample observations. Moreover, our method can naturally afford mini-batch update and it gives speed up of convergence. We show that, under mild assumptions, our method converges exponentially. The numerical experiments show that our method actually performs efficiently."}
{"text": "  We study exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits in a setting where $k$ players collaborate in order to identify an $\\epsilon$-optimal arm. Our motivation comes from recent employment of bandit algorithms in computationally intensive, large-scale applications. Our results demonstrate a non-trivial tradeoff between the number of arm pulls required by each of the players, and the amount of communication between them. In particular, our main result shows that by allowing the $k$ players to communicate only once, they are able to learn $\\sqrt{k}$ times faster than a single player. That is, distributing learning to $k$ players gives rise to a factor $\\sqrt{k}$ parallel speed-up. We complement this result with a lower bound showing this is in general the best possible. On the other extreme, we present an algorithm that achieves the ideal factor $k$ speed-up in learning performance, with communication only logarithmic in $1/\\epsilon$."}
{"text": "  The kernel support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most widely used classification methods; however, the amount of computation required becomes the bottleneck when facing millions of samples. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel divide-and-conquer solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the division step, we partition the kernel SVM problem into smaller subproblems by clustering the data, so that each subproblem can be solved independently and efficiently. We show theoretically that the support vectors identified by the subproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of the entire kernel SVM problem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately by kernel clustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems are used to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly as suggested by our analysis. By extending this idea, we develop a multilevel Divide-and-Conquer SVM algorithm with adaptive clustering and early prediction strategy, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training speed, testing accuracy, and memory usage. As an example, on the covtype dataset with half-a-million samples, DC-SVM is 7 times faster than LIBSVM in obtaining the exact SVM solution (to within $10^{-6}$ relative error) which achieves 96.15% prediction accuracy. Moreover, with our proposed early prediction strategy, DC-SVM achieves about 96% accuracy in only 12 minutes, which is more than 100 times faster than LIBSVM."}
{"text": "  Support vector machine (SVM) has been one of the most popular learning algorithms, with the central idea of maximizing the minimum margin, i.e., the smallest distance from the instances to the classification boundary. Recent theoretical results, however, disclosed that maximizing the minimum margin does not necessarily lead to better generalization performances, and instead, the margin distribution has been proven to be more crucial. In this paper, we propose the Large margin Distribution Machine (LDM), which tries to achieve a better generalization performance by optimizing the margin distribution. We characterize the margin distribution by the first- and second-order statistics, i.e., the margin mean and variance. The LDM is a general learning approach which can be used in any place where SVM can be applied, and its superiority is verified both theoretically and empirically in this paper."}
{"text": "  Analyzing and understanding the structure of complex relational data is important in many applications including analysis of the connectivity in the human brain. Such networks can have prominent patterns on different scales, calling for a hierarchically structured model. We propose two non-parametric Bayesian hierarchical network models based on Gibbs fragmentation tree priors, and demonstrate their ability to capture nested patterns in simulated networks. On real networks we demonstrate detection of hierarchical structure and show predictive performance on par with the state of the art. We envision that our methods can be employed in exploratory analysis of large scale complex networks for example to model human brain connectivity."}
{"text": "  Most Machine Learning (ML) methods, from clustering to classification, rely on a distance function to describe relationships between datapoints. For complex datasets it is hard to avoid making some arbitrary choices when defining a distance function. To compare images, one must choose a spatial scale, for signals, a temporal scale. The right scale is hard to pin down and it is preferable when results do not depend too tightly on the exact value one picked. Topological data analysis seeks to address this issue by focusing on the notion of neighbourhood instead of distance. It is shown that in some cases a simpler solution is available. It can be checked how strongly distance relationships depend on a hyperparameter using dimensionality reduction. A variant of dynamical multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) is formulated, which embeds datapoints as curves. The resulting algorithm is based on the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) and provides a simple and efficient way of visualizing changes and invariances in distance patterns as a hyperparameter is varied. A variant to analyze the dependence on multiple hyperparameters is also presented. A cMDS algorithm that is straightforward to implement, use and extend is provided. To illustrate the possibilities of cMDS, cMDS is applied to several real-world data sets."}
{"text": "  It is surprising that last two decades many works in time series data mining and clustering were concerned with measures of similarity of time series but not with measures of association that can be used for measuring possible direct and inverse relationships between time series. Inverse relationships can exist between dynamics of prices and sell volumes, between growth patterns of competitive companies, between well production data in oilfields, between wind velocity and air pollution concentration etc. The paper develops a theoretical basis for analysis and construction of time series shape association measures. Starting from the axioms of time series shape association measures it studies the methods of construction of measures satisfying these axioms. Several general methods of construction of such measures suitable for measuring time series shape similarity and shape association are proposed. Time series shape association measures based on Minkowski distance and data standardization methods are considered. The cosine similarity and the Pearsons correlation coefficient are obtained as particular cases of the proposed general methods that can be used also for construction of new association measures in data analysis."}
{"text": "  We derive a family of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods for agents, who face sequential decision-making tasks in uncertain environments. By applying a utility function to the temporal difference (TD) error, nonlinear transformations are effectively applied not only to the received rewards but also to the true transition probabilities of the underlying Markov decision process. When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents' behaviors express key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), for example different risk-preferences for gains and losses as well as the shape of subjective probability curves. We derive a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, which is necessary for modeling human behavior when transition probabilities are unknown, and prove its convergence. As a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework we apply it to quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find, that the risk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral data and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses which is indeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured fMRI signals show a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive TD error with BOLD signal change in the ventral striatum. In addition we find a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive Q-values with neural activity in the striatum, cingulate cortex and insula, which is not present if standard Q-values are used."}
{"text": "  We present an algorithm for minimizing a sum of functions that combines the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the second order curvature information leveraged by quasi-Newton methods. We unify these disparate approaches by maintaining an independent Hessian approximation for each contributing function in the sum. We maintain computational tractability and limit memory requirements even for high dimensional optimization problems by storing and manipulating these quadratic approximations in a shared, time evolving, low dimensional subspace. Each update step requires only a single contributing function or minibatch evaluation (as in SGD), and each step is scaled using an approximate inverse Hessian and little to no adjustment of hyperparameters is required (as is typical for quasi-Newton methods). This algorithm contrasts with earlier stochastic second order techniques that treat the Hessian of each contributing function as a noisy approximation to the full Hessian, rather than as a target for direct estimation. We experimentally demonstrate improved convergence on seven diverse optimization problems. The algorithm is released as open source Python and MATLAB packages."}
{"text": "  Missing value imputation is an important practical problem. There is a large body of work on it, but there does not exist any work that formulates the problem in a structured output setting. Also, most applications have constraints on the imputed data, for example on the distribution associated with each variable. None of the existing imputation methods use these constraints. In this paper we propose a structured output approach for missing value imputation that also incorporates domain constraints. We focus on large margin models, but it is easy to extend the ideas to probabilistic models. We deal with the intractable inference step in learning via a piecewise training technique that is simple, efficient, and effective. Comparison with existing state-of-the-art and baseline imputation methods shows that our method gives significantly improved performance on the Hamming loss measure."}
{"text": "  In structured output learning, obtaining labelled data for real-world applications is usually costly, while unlabelled examples are available in abundance. Semi-supervised structured classification has been developed to handle large amounts of unlabelled structured data. In this work, we consider semi-supervised structural SVMs with domain constraints. The optimization problem, which in general is not convex, contains the loss terms associated with the labelled and unlabelled examples along with the domain constraints. We propose a simple optimization approach, which alternates between solving a supervised learning problem and a constraint matching problem. Solving the constraint matching problem is difficult for structured prediction, and we propose an efficient and effective hill-climbing method to solve it. The alternating optimization is carried out within a deterministic annealing framework, which helps in effective constraint matching, and avoiding local minima which are not very useful. The algorithm is simple to implement and achieves comparable generalization performance on benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  The increased availability of data in recent years has led several authors to ask whether it is possible to use data as a {\\em computational} resource. That is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required to perform the learning task?   We give the first positive answer to this question for a {\\em natural supervised learning problem} --- we consider agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over $3$-sparse vectors in $\\{-1,1,0\\}^n$. This class is inefficiently learnable using $O\\left(n/\\epsilon^2\\right)$ examples. Our main contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establishing computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely believed assumption that refuting random $\\mathrm{3CNF}$ formulas is hard, it is impossible to efficiently learn this class using only $O\\left(n/\\epsilon^2\\right)$ examples. We further show that under stronger hardness assumptions, even $O\\left(n^{1.499}/\\epsilon^2\\right)$ examples do not suffice. On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class efficiently using $\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(n^2/\\epsilon^2\\right)$ examples. This formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of quantitatively evaluating missing value imputation algorithms. Given a dataset with missing values and a choice of several imputation algorithms to fill them in, there is currently no principled way to rank the algorithms using a quantitative metric. We develop a framework based on treating imputation evaluation as a problem of comparing two distributions and show how it can be used to compute quantitative metrics. We present an efficient procedure for applying this framework to practical datasets, demonstrate several metrics derived from the existing literature on comparing distributions, and propose a new metric called Neighborhood-based Dissimilarity Score which is fast to compute and provides similar results. Results are shown on several datasets, metrics, and imputations algorithms."}
{"text": "  The kernel $k$-means is an effective method for data clustering which extends the commonly-used $k$-means algorithm to work on a similarity matrix over complex data structures. The kernel $k$-means algorithm is however computationally very complex as it requires the complete data matrix to be calculated and stored. Further, the kernelized nature of the kernel $k$-means algorithm hinders the parallelization of its computations on modern infrastructures for distributed computing. In this paper, we are defining a family of kernel-based low-dimensional embeddings that allows for scaling kernel $k$-means on MapReduce via an efficient and unified parallelization strategy. Afterwards, we propose two methods for low-dimensional embedding that adhere to our definition of the embedding family. Exploiting the proposed parallelization strategy, we present two scalable MapReduce algorithms for kernel $k$-means. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms through an empirical evaluation on benchmark data sets."}
{"text": "  The task of assigning label sequences to a set of observed sequences is common in computational linguistics. Several models for sequence labeling have been proposed over the last few years. Here, we focus on discriminative models for sequence labeling. Many batch and online (updating model parameters after visiting each example) learning algorithms have been proposed in the literature. On large datasets, online algorithms are preferred as batch learning methods are slow. These online algorithms were designed to solve either a primal or a dual problem. However, there has been no systematic comparison of these algorithms in terms of their speed, generalization performance (accuracy/likelihood) and their ability to achieve steady state generalization performance fast. With this aim, we compare different algorithms and make recommendations, useful for a practitioner. We conclude that the selection of an algorithm for sequence labeling depends on the evaluation criterion used and its implementation simplicity."}
{"text": "  In Stochastic blockmodels, which are among the most prominent statistical models for cluster analysis of complex networks, clusters are defined as groups of nodes with statistically similar link probabilities within and between groups. A recent extension by Karrer and Newman incorporates a node degree correction to model degree heterogeneity within each group. Although this demonstrably leads to better performance on several networks it is not obvious whether modelling node degree is always appropriate or necessary. We formulate the degree corrected stochastic blockmodel as a non-parametric Bayesian model, incorporating a parameter to control the amount of degree correction which can then be inferred from data. Additionally, our formulation yields principled ways of inferring the number of groups as well as predicting missing links in the network which can be used to quantify the model's predictive performance. On synthetic data we demonstrate that including the degree correction yields better performance both on recovering the true group structure and predicting missing links when degree heterogeneity is present, whereas performance is on par for data with no degree heterogeneity within clusters. On seven real networks (with no ground truth group structure available) we show that predictive performance is about equal whether or not degree correction is included; however, for some networks significantly fewer clusters are discovered when correcting for degree indicating that the data can be more compactly explained by clusters of heterogenous degree nodes."}
{"text": "  Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a special type of the temporally deep network model, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the recurrent matrix is carefully designed and both the recurrent and input matrices are fixed. An ESN uses the linearity of the activation function of the output units to simplify the learning of the output matrix. In this paper, we devise a special technique that take advantage of this linearity in the output units of an ESN, to learn the input and recurrent matrices. This has not been done in earlier ESNs due to their well known difficulty in learning those matrices. Compared to the technique of BackPropagation Through Time (BPTT) in learning general RNNs, our proposed method exploits linearity of activation function in the output units to formulate the relationships amongst the various matrices in an RNN. These relationships results in the gradient of the cost function having an analytical form and being more accurate. This would enable us to compute the gradients instead of obtaining them by recursion as in BPTT. Experimental results on phone state classification show that learning one or both the input and recurrent matrices in an ESN yields superior results compared to traditional ESNs that do not learn these matrices, especially when longer time steps are used."}
{"text": "  Many researches have been devoted to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric, which can effectively improve the performance of kNN classification. Most approaches are iterative and computational expensive and linear rigidity still critically limits metric learning algorithm to perform better. We proposed a computational economical framework to learn multiple metrics in closed-form."}
{"text": "  We propose a method for inferring the conditional indepen- dence graph (CIG) of a high-dimensional discrete-time Gaus- sian vector random process from finite-length observations. Our approach does not rely on a parametric model (such as, e.g., an autoregressive model) for the vector random process; rather, it only assumes certain spectral smoothness proper- ties. The proposed inference scheme is compressive in that it works for sample sizes that are (much) smaller than the number of scalar process components. We provide analytical conditions for our method to correctly identify the CIG with high probability."}
{"text": "  In this work we compute lower Lipschitz bounds of $\\ell_p$ pooling operators for $p=1, 2, \\infty$ as well as $\\ell_p$ pooling operators preceded by half-rectification layers. These give sufficient conditions for the design of invertible neural network layers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and image patches confirm that pooling layers can be inverted with phase recovery algorithms. Moreover, the regularity of the inverse pooling, controlled by the lower Lipschitz constant, is empirically verified with a nearest neighbor regression."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we push forward the idea of machine learning systems whose operators can be modified and fine-tuned for each problem. This allows us to propose a learning paradigm where users can write (or adapt) their operators, according to the problem, data representation and the way the information should be navigated. To achieve this goal, data instances, background knowledge, rules, programs and operators are all written in the same functional language, Erlang. Since changing operators affect how the search space needs to be explored, heuristics are learnt as a result of a decision process based on reinforcement learning where each action is defined as a choice of operator and rule. As a result, the architecture can be seen as a 'system for writing machine learning systems' or to explore new operators where the policy reuse (as a kind of transfer learning) is allowed. States and actions are represented in a Q matrix which is actually a table, from which a supervised model is learnt. This makes it possible to have a more flexible mapping between old and new problems, since we work with an abstraction of rules and actions. We include some examples sharing reuse and the application of the system gErl to IQ problems. In order to evaluate gErl, we will test it against some structured problems: a selection of IQ test tasks and some experiments on some structured prediction problems (list patterns)."}
{"text": "  The covariate shift is a challenging problem in supervised learning that results from the discrepancy between the training and test distributions. An effective approach which recently drew a considerable attention in the research community is to reweight the training samples to minimize that discrepancy. In specific, many methods are based on developing Density-ratio (DR) estimation techniques that apply to both regression and classification problems. Although these methods work well for regression problems, their performance on classification problems is not satisfactory. This is due to a key observation that these methods focus on matching the sample marginal distributions without paying attention to preserving the separation between classes in the reweighted space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for Discriminative Density-ratio (DDR) estimation that addresses the aforementioned problem and aims at estimating the density-ratio of joint distributions in a class-wise manner. The proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that alternates between estimating the class information for the test data and estimating new density ratio for each class. To incorporate the estimated class information of the test data, a soft matching technique is proposed. In addition, we employ an effective criterion which adopts mutual information as an indicator to stop the iterative procedure while resulting in a decision boundary that lies in a sparse region. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and robustness."}
{"text": "  Symmetric binary matrices representing relations among entities are commonly collected in many areas. Our focus is on dynamically evolving binary relational matrices, with interest being in inference on the relationship structure and prediction. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian dynamic model, which reduces dimensionality in characterizing the binary matrix through a lower-dimensional latent space representation, with the latent coordinates evolving in continuous time via Gaussian processes. By using a logistic mapping function from the probability matrix space to the latent relational space, we obtain a flexible and computational tractable formulation. Employing P\\`olya-Gamma data augmentation, an efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation, with the dimension of the latent space automatically inferred. We provide some theoretical results on flexibility of the model, and illustrate performance via simulation experiments. We also consider an application to co-movements in world financial markets."}
{"text": "  A hierarchical clustering method is stable if small perturbations on the data set produce small perturbations in the result. These perturbations are measured using the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. We study the problem of stability on linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods. We obtain that, under some basic conditions, standard linkage-based methods are semi-stable. This means that they are stable if the input data is close enough to an ultrametric space. We prove that, apart from exotic examples, introducing any unchaining condition in the algorithm always produces unstable methods."}
{"text": "  We investigate a generic problem of learning pairwise exponential family graphical models with pairwise sufficient statistics defined by a global mapping function, e.g., Mercer kernels. This subclass of pairwise graphical models allow us to flexibly capture complex interactions among variables beyond pairwise product. We propose two $\\ell_1$-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimators to learn the model parameters from i.i.d. samples. The first one is a joint estimator which estimates all the parameters simultaneously. The second one is a node-wise conditional estimator which estimates the parameters individually for each node. For both estimators, we show that under proper conditions the extra flexibility gained in our model comes at almost no cost of statistical and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real datasets."}
{"text": "  Feature selection plays a pivotal role in learning, particularly in areas were parsimonious features can provide insight into the underlying process, such as biology. Recent approaches for non-linear feature selection employing greedy optimisation of Centred Kernel Target Alignment(KTA), while exhibiting strong results in terms of generalisation accuracy and sparsity, can become computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional datasets. We propose randSel, a randomised feature selection algorithm, with attractive scaling properties. Our theoretical analysis of randSel provides strong probabilistic guarantees for the correct identification of relevant features. Experimental results on real and artificial data, show that the method successfully identifies effective features, performing better than a number of competitive approaches."}
{"text": "  For random graphs distributed according to stochastic blockmodels, a special case of latent position graphs, adjacency spectral embedding followed by appropriate vertex classification is asymptotically Bayes optimal; but this approach requires knowledge of and critically depends on the model dimension. In this paper, we propose a sparse representation vertex classifier which does not require information about the model dimension. This classifier represents a test vertex as a sparse combination of the vertices in the training set and uses the recovered coefficients to classify the test vertex. We prove consistency of our proposed classifier for stochastic blockmodels, and demonstrate that the sparse representation classifier can predict vertex labels with higher accuracy than adjacency spectral embedding approaches via both simulation studies and real data experiments. Our results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed vertex classifier when the model dimension is unknown."}
{"text": "  Challenging optimization problems, which elude acceptable solution via conventional calculus methods, arise commonly in different areas of industrial design and practice. Hard optimization problems are those who manifest the following behavior: a) high number of independent input variables; b) very complex or irregular multi-modal fitness; c) computational expensive fitness evaluation. This paper will focus on some theoretical issues that have strong implications for practice. I will stress how an interpretation of the No Free Lunch theorem leads naturally to a general Bayesian optimization framework. The choice of a prior over the space of functions is a critical and inevitable step in every black-box optimization."}
{"text": "  Robust tensor recovery plays an instrumental role in robustifying tensor decompositions for multilinear data analysis against outliers, gross corruptions and missing values and has a diverse array of applications. In this paper, we study the problem of robust low-rank tensor recovery in a convex optimization framework, drawing upon recent advances in robust Principal Component Analysis and tensor completion. We propose tailored optimization algorithms with global convergence guarantees for solving both the constrained and the Lagrangian formulations of the problem. These algorithms are based on the highly efficient alternating direction augmented Lagrangian and accelerated proximal gradient methods. We also propose a nonconvex model that can often improve the recovery results from the convex models. We investigate the empirical recoverability properties of the convex and nonconvex formulations and compare the computational performance of the algorithms on simulated data. We demonstrate through a number of real applications the practical effectiveness of this convex optimization framework for robust low-rank tensor recovery."}
{"text": "  Several interesting generative learning algorithms involve a complex probability distribution over many random variables, involving intractable normalization constants or latent variable normalization. Some of them may even not have an analytic expression for the unnormalized probability function and no tractable approximation. This makes it difficult to estimate the quality of these models, once they have been trained, or to monitor their quality (e.g. for early stopping) while training. A previously proposed method is based on constructing a non-parametric density estimator of the model's probability function from samples generated by the model. We revisit this idea, propose a more efficient estimator, and prove that it provides a lower bound on the true test log-likelihood, and an unbiased estimator as the number of generated samples goes to infinity, although one that incorporates the effect of poor mixing. We further propose a biased variant of the estimator that can be used reliably with a finite number of samples for the purpose of model comparison."}
{"text": "  Novelty detection plays an important role in machine learning and signal processing. This paper studies novelty detection in a new setting where the data object is represented as a bag of instances and associated with multiple class labels, referred to as multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning. Contrary to the common assumption in MIML that each instance in a bag belongs to one of the known classes, in novelty detection, we focus on the scenario where bags may contain novel-class instances. The goal is to determine, for any given instance in a new bag, whether it belongs to a known class or a novel class. Detecting novelty in the MIML setting captures many real-world phenomena and has many potential applications. For example, in a collection of tagged images, the tag may only cover a subset of objects existing in the images. Discovering an object whose class has not been previously tagged can be useful for the purpose of soliciting a label for the new object class. To address this novel problem, we present a discriminative framework for detecting new class instances. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and reveal that the presence of unlabeled novel instances in training bags is helpful to the detection of such instances in testing stage."}
{"text": "  Given data sampled from a number of variables, one is often interested in the underlying causal relationships in the form of a directed acyclic graph. In the general case, without interventions on some of the variables it is only possible to identify the graph up to its Markov equivalence class. However, in some situations one can find the true causal graph just from observational data, for example in structural equation models with additive noise and nonlinear edge functions. Most current methods for achieving this rely on nonparametric independence tests. One of the problems there is that the null hypothesis is independence, which is what one would like to get evidence for. We take a different approach in our work by using a penalized likelihood as a score for model selection. This is practically feasible in many settings and has the advantage of yielding a natural ranking of the candidate models. When making smoothness assumptions on the probability density space, we prove consistency of the penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We also present empirical results for simulated scenarios and real two-dimensional data sets (cause-effect pairs) where we obtain similar results as other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  We study sequential prediction of real-valued, arbitrary and unknown sequences under the squared error loss as well as the best parametric predictor out of a large, continuous class of predictors. Inspired by recent results from computational learning theory, we refrain from any statistical assumptions and define the performance with respect to the class of general parametric predictors. In particular, we present generic lower and upper bounds on this relative performance by transforming the prediction task into a parameter learning problem. We first introduce the lower bounds on this relative performance in the mixture of experts framework, where we show that for any sequential algorithm, there always exists a sequence for which the performance of the sequential algorithm is lower bounded by zero. We then introduce a sequential learning algorithm to predict such arbitrary and unknown sequences, and calculate upper bounds on its total squared prediction error for every bounded sequence. We further show that in some scenarios we achieve matching lower and upper bounds demonstrating that our algorithms are optimal in a strong minimax sense such that their performances cannot be improved further. As an interesting result we also prove that for the worst case scenario, the performance of randomized algorithms can be achieved by sequential algorithms so that randomized algorithms does not improve the performance."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of learning reject option classifiers.

In this paper, we propose {\\em double ramp loss} function which gives a continuous upper bound for $(0-d-1)$ loss. Our approach is based on minimizing regularized risk under the double ramp loss using {\\em difference of convex (DC) programming}. We show the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets. Our approach performs better than the state of the art reject option classification approaches."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel family of adaptive filtering algorithms based on a relative logarithmic cost. The new family intrinsically combines the higher and lower order measures of the error into a single continuous update based on the error amount. We introduce important members of this family of algorithms such as the least mean logarithmic square (LMLS) and least logarithmic absolute difference (LLAD) algorithms that improve the convergence performance of the conventional algorithms. However, our approach and analysis are generic such that they cover other well-known cost functions as described in the paper. The LMLS algorithm achieves comparable convergence performance with the least mean fourth (LMF) algorithm and extends the stability bound on the step size. The LLAD and least mean square (LMS) algorithms demonstrate similar convergence performance in impulse-free noise environments while the LLAD algorithm is robust against impulsive interferences and outperforms the sign algorithm (SA). We analyze the transient, steady state and tracking performance of the introduced algorithms and demonstrate the match of the theoretical analyzes and simulation results. We show the extended stability bound of the LMLS algorithm and analyze the robustness of the LLAD algorithm against impulsive interferences. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in different scenarios through numerical examples."}
{"text": "  TThe problem is to identify a probability associated with a set of natural numbers, given an infinite data sequence of elements from the set. If the given sequence is drawn i.i.d. and the probability mass function involved (the target) belongs to a computably enumerable (c.e.) or co-computably enumerable (co-c.e.) set of computable probability mass functions, then there is an algorithm to almost surely identify the target in the limit. The technical tool is the strong law of large numbers. If the set is finite and the elements of the sequence are dependent while the sequence is typical in the sense of Martin-L\\\"of for at least one measure belonging to a c.e. or co-c.e. set of computable measures, then there is an algorithm to identify in the limit a computable measure for which the sequence is typical (there may be more than one such measure).

{"text": "  In this paper, we first prove a high probability bound rather than an expectation bound for stochastic optimization with smooth loss. Furthermore, the existing analysis requires the knowledge of optimal classifier for tuning the step size in order to achieve the desired bound. However, this information is usually not accessible in advanced. We also propose a strategy to address the limitation."}
{"text": "  Recent advances have made it feasible to apply the stochastic variational paradigm to a collapsed representation of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). While the stochastic variational paradigm has successfully been applied to an uncollapsed representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), no attempts to apply this type of inference in a collapsed setting of non-parametric topic modeling have been put forward so far. In this paper we explore such a collapsed stochastic variational Bayes inference for the HDP. The proposed online algorithm is easy to implement and accounts for the inference of hyper-parameters. First experiments show a promising improvement in predictive performance."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel approach for designing kernels for support vector machines (SVMs) when the class label is linked to the observation through a latent state and the likelihood function of the observation given the state (the sensing model) is available. We show that the Bayes-optimum decision boundary is a hyperplane under a mapping defined by the likelihood function. Combining this with the maximum margin principle yields kernels for SVMs that leverage knowledge of the sensing model in an optimal way. We derive the optimum kernel for the bag-of-words (BoWs) sensing model and demonstrate its superior performance over other kernels in document and image classification tasks. These results indicate that such optimum sensing-aware kernel SVMs can match the performance of rather sophisticated state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"text": "  Structured prediction plays a central role in machine learning applications from computational biology to computer vision. These models require significantly more computation than unstructured models, and, in many applications, algorithms may need to make predictions within a computational budget or in an anytime fashion. In this work we propose an anytime technique for learning structured prediction that, at training time, incorporates both structural elements and feature computation trade-offs that affect test-time inference. We apply our technique to the challenging problem of scene understanding in computer vision and demonstrate efficient and anytime predictions that gradually improve towards state-of-the-art classification performance as the allotted time increases."}
{"text": "  Non-orthogonal joint diagonalization (NJD) free of prewhitening has been widely studied in the context of blind source separation (BSS) and array signal processing, etc. However, NJD is used to retrieve the jointly diagonalizable structure for a single set of target matrices which are mostly formulized with a single dataset, and thus is insufficient to handle multiple datasets with inter-set dependences, a scenario often encountered in joint BSS (J-BSS) applications. As such, we present a generalized NJD (GNJD) algorithm to simultaneously perform asymmetric NJD upon multiple sets of target matrices with mutually linked loading matrices, by using LU decomposition and successive rotations, to enable J-BSS over multiple datasets with indication/exploitation of their mutual dependences. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of image representation for the tasks of unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. In those learning tasks, the raw image vectors may not provide enough representation for their intrinsic structures due to their highly dense feature space. To overcome this problem, the raw image vectors should be mapped to a proper representation space which can capture the latent structure of the original data and represent the data explicitly for further learning tasks such as clustering.   Inspired by the recent research works on deep neural network and representation learning, in this paper, we introduce the multiple-layer auto-encoder into image representation, we also apply the locally invariant ideal to our image representation with auto-encoders and propose a novel method, called Graph regularized Auto-Encoder (GAE). GAE can provide a compact representation which uncovers the hidden semantics and simultaneously respects the intrinsic geometric structure.   Extensive experiments on image clustering show encouraging results of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms on real-word cases."}
{"text": "  Model interpretation is one of the key aspects of the model evaluation process. The explanation of the relationship between model variables and outputs is relatively easy for statistical models, such as linear regressions, thanks to the availability of model parameters and their statistical significance. For \"black box\" models, such as random forest, this information is hidden inside the model structure. This work presents an approach for computing feature contributions for random forest classification models. It allows for the determination of the influence of each variable on the model prediction for an individual instance. By analysing feature contributions for a training dataset, the most significant variables can be determined and their typical contribution towards predictions made for individual classes, i.e., class-specific feature contribution \"patterns\", are discovered. These patterns represent a standard behaviour of the model and allow for an additional assessment of the model reliability for a new data. Interpretation of feature contributions for two UCI benchmark datasets shows the potential of the proposed methodology. The robustness of results is demonstrated through an extensive analysis of feature contributions calculated for a large number of generated random forest models."}

We study a bandit game in which, at each step $t$, an adversary chooses a hidden weight weight vector $s_t$, a player chooses a vertex $\\pi_t$ of the permutahedron and suffers an observed loss of $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\pi(i) s_t(i)$.   A previous algorithm CombBand of Cesa-Bianchi et al (2009) guarantees a regret of $O(n\\sqrt{T \\log n})$ for a time horizon of $T$. Unfortunately, CombBand requires at each step an $n$-by-$n$ matrix permanent approximation to within improved accuracy as $T$ grows, resulting in a total running time that is super linear in $T$, making it impractical for large time horizons.   We provide an algorithm of regret $O(n^{3/2}\\sqrt{T})$ with total time complexity $O(n^3T)$. The ideas are a combination of CombBand and a recent algorithm by Ailon (2013) for online optimization over the permutahedron in the full information setting. The technical core is a bound on the variance of the Plackett-Luce noisy sorting process's \"pseudo loss\". The bound is obtained by establishing positive semi-definiteness of a family of 3-by-3 matrices generated from rational functions of exponentials of 3 parameters."}
{"text": "  The performance of spectral clustering can be considerably improved via regularization, as demonstrated empirically in Amini et. al (2012). Here, we provide an attempt at quantifying this improvement through theoretical analysis. Under the stochastic block model (SBM), and its extensions, previous results on spectral clustering relied on the minimum degree of the graph being sufficiently large for its good performance. By examining the scenario where the regularization parameter $\\tau$ is large we show that the minimum degree assumption can potentially be removed. As a special case, for an SBM with two blocks, the results require the maximum degree to be large (grow faster than $\\log n$) as opposed to the minimum degree.   More importantly, we show the usefulness of regularization in situations where not all nodes belong to well-defined clusters. Our results rely on a `bias-variance'-like trade-off that arises from understanding the concentration of the sample Laplacian and the eigen gap as a function of the regularization parameter. As a byproduct of our bounds, we propose a data-driven technique \\textit{DKest} (standing for estimated Davis-Kahan bounds) for choosing the regularization parameter. This technique is shown to work well through simulations and on a real data set."}
{"text": "  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have recently achieved the best performance in off-line Handwriting Text Recognition. At the same time, learning RNN by gradient descent leads to slow convergence, and training times are particularly long when the training database consists of full lines of text. In this paper, we propose an easy way to accelerate stochastic gradient descent in this set-up, and in the general context of learning to recognize sequences. The principle is called Curriculum Learning, or shaping. The idea is to first learn to recognize short sequences before training on all available training sequences. Experiments on three different handwritten text databases (Rimes, IAM, OpenHaRT) show that a simple implementation of this strategy can significantly speed up the training of RNN for Text Recognition, and even significantly improve performance in some cases."}
{"text": "  A key challenge in designing convolutional network models is sizing them appropriately. Many factors are involved in these decisions, including number of layers, feature maps, kernel sizes, etc. Complicating this further is the fact that each of these influence not only the numbers and dimensions of the activation units, but also the total number of parameters. In this paper we focus on assessing the independent contributions of three of these linked variables: The numbers of layers, feature maps, and parameters. To accomplish this, we employ a recursive convolutional network whose weights are tied between layers; this allows us to vary each of the three factors in a controlled setting. We find that while increasing the numbers of layers and parameters each have clear benefit, the number of feature maps (and hence dimensionality of the representation) appears ancillary, and finds most of its benefit through the introduction of more weights. Our results (i) empirically confirm the notion that adding layers alone increases computational power, within the context of convolutional layers, and (ii) suggest that precise sizing of convolutional feature map dimensions is itself of little concern; more attention should be paid to the number of parameters in these layers instead."}
{"text": "  We present an exploration of the rich theoretical connections between several classes of regularized models, network flows, and recent results in submodular function theory. This work unifies key aspects of these problems under a common theory, leading to novel methods for working with several important models of interest in statistics, machine learning and computer vision.   In Part 1, we review the concepts of network flows and submodular function optimization theory foundational to our results. We then examine the connections between network flows and the minimum-norm algorithm from submodular optimization, extending and improving several current results. This leads to a concise representation of the structure of a large class of pairwise regularized models important in machine learning, statistics and computer vision.   In Part 2, we describe the full regularization path of a class of penalized regression problems with dependent variables that includes the graph-guided LASSO and total variation constrained models. This description also motivates a practical algorithm. This allows us to efficiently find the regularization path of the discretized version of TV penalized models. Ultimately, our new algorithms scale up to high-dimensional problems with millions of variables."}
{"text": "  In this paper we present a model for email authorship identification (EAI) by employing a Cluster-based Classification (CCM) technique. Traditionally, stylometric features have been successfully employed in various authorship analysis tasks; we extend the traditional feature-set to include some more interesting and effective features for email authorship identification (e.g. the last punctuation mark used in an email, the tendency of an author to use capitalization at the start of an email, or the punctuation after a greeting or farewell). We also included Info Gain feature selection based content features. It is observed that the use of such features in the authorship identification process has a positive impact on the accuracy of the authorship identification task. We performed experiments to justify our arguments and compared the results with other base line models. Experimental results reveal that the proposed CCM-based email authorship identification model, along with the proposed feature set, outperforms the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM)-based models, as well as the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2]. The proposed model attains an accuracy rate of 94% for 10 authors, 89% for 25 authors, and 81% for 50 authors, respectively on Enron dataset, while 89.5% accuracy has been achieved on authors' constructed real email dataset. The results on Enron dataset have been achieved on quite a large number of authors as compared to the models proposed by Iqbal et al. [1, 2]."}
{"text": "  In this paper we present two related, kernel-based Distance Metric Learning (DML) methods. Their respective models non-linearly map data from their original space to an output space, and subsequent distance measurements are performed in the output space via a Mahalanobis metric. The dimensionality of the output space can be directly controlled to facilitate the learning of a low-rank metric. Both methods allow for simultaneous inference of the associated metric and the mapping to the output space, which can be used to visualize the data, when the output space is 2- or 3-dimensional. Experimental results for a collection of classification tasks illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods over other traditional and kernel-based DML approaches."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a RKHS, in general, of vector-valued functions intended to be used as hypothesis space for multi-task classification. It extends similar hypothesis spaces that have previously considered in the literature. Assuming this space, an improved Empirical Rademacher Complexity-based generalization bound is derived. The analysis is itself extended to an MKL setting. The connection between the proposed hypothesis space and a Group-Lasso type regularizer is discussed. Finally, experimental results, with some SVM-based Multi-Task Learning problems, underline the quality of the derived bounds and validate the paper's analysis."}
{"text": "  The question of how to determine the number of independent latent factors (topics) in mixture models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is of great practical importance. In most applications, the exact number of topics is unknown, and depends on the application and the size of the data set. Bayesian nonparametric methods can avoid the problem of topic number selection, but they can be impracticably slow for large sample sizes and are subject to local optima. We develop a guaranteed procedure for topic number recovery that does not necessitate learning the model's latent parameters beforehand. Our procedure relies on adapting results from random matrix theory. Performance of our topic number recovery procedure is superior to hLDA, a nonparametric method. We also discuss some implications of our results on the sample complexity and accuracy of popular spectral learning algorithms for LDA. Our results and procedure can be extended to spectral learning algorithms for other exchangeable mixture models as well as Hidden Markov Models."}
{"text": "  Regularized regression techniques for linear regression have been created the last few ten years to reduce the flaws of ordinary least squares regression with regard to prediction accuracy. In this paper, new methods for using regularized regression in model choice are introduced, and we distinguish the conditions in which regularized regression develops our ability to discriminate models. We applied all the five methods that use penalty-based (regularization) shrinkage to handle Oxazolines and Oxazoles derivatives descriptor dataset with far more predictors than observations. The lasso, ridge, elasticnet, lars and relaxed lasso further possess the desirable property that they simultaneously select relevant predictive descriptors and optimally estimate their effects. Here, we comparatively evaluate the performance of five regularized linear regression methods The assessment of the performance of each model by means of benchmark experiments is an established exercise. Cross-validation and resampling methods are generally used to arrive point evaluates the efficiencies which are compared to recognize methods with acceptable features. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and Square of usual correlation between predictors and observed mean inhibitory concentration of antitubercular activity (R square). We found that all five regularized regression models were able to produce feasible models and efficient capturing the linearity in the data. The elastic net and lars had similar accuracies as well as lasso and relaxed lasso had similar accuracies but outperformed ridge regression in terms of the RMSE and R square metrics."}
{"text": "  We argue for the use of active learning methods for player modelling. In active learning, the learning algorithm chooses where to sample the search space so as to optimise learning progress. We hypothesise that player modelling based on active learning could result in vastly more efficient learning, but will require big changes in how data is collected. Some example active player modelling scenarios are described. A particular form of active learning is also equivalent to an influential formalisation of (human and machine) curiosity, and games with active learning could therefore be seen as being curious about the player. We further hypothesise that this form of curiosity is symmetric, and therefore that games that explore their players based on the principles of active learning will turn out to select game configurations that are interesting to the player that is being explored."}
{"text": "  This paper aims at justifying LWF and AMP chain graphs by showing that they do not represent arbitrary independence models. Specifically, we show that every chain graph is inclusion optimal wrt the intersection of the independence models represented by a set of directed and acyclic graphs under conditioning. This implies that the independence model represented by the chain graph can be accounted for by a set of causal models that are subject to selection bias, which in turn can be accounted for by a system that switches between different regimes or configurations."}
{"text": "  The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difficulty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from first principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lovasz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random fields, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider specific graph models, the torus, k-nearest neighbor graphs, and epsilon-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds."}
{"text": "  Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is an effective framework for performing max-margin online learning. But the deterministic formulation and estimated single large-margin model could limit its capability in discovering descriptive structures underlying complex data. This pa- per presents online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive (BayesPA) learning, which subsumes the online PA and extends naturally to incorporate latent variables and perform nonparametric Bayesian inference, thus providing great flexibility for explorative analysis. We apply BayesPA to topic modeling and derive efficient online learning algorithms for max-margin topic models. We further develop nonparametric methods to resolve the number of topics. Experimental results on real datasets show that our approaches significantly improve time efficiency while maintaining comparable results with the batch counterparts."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes a new method for the K-armed dueling bandit problem, a variation on the regular K-armed bandit problem that offers only relative feedback about pairs of arms. Our approach extends the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to the relative setting by using estimates of the pairwise probabilities to select a promising arm and applying Upper Confidence Bound with the winner as a benchmark. We prove a finite-time regret bound of order O(log t). In addition, our empirical results using real data from an information retrieval application show that it greatly outperforms the state of the art."}
{"text": "  Policy Gradient methods that explore directly in parameter space are among the most effective and robust direct policy search methods and have drawn a lot of attention lately. The basic method from this field, Policy Gradients with Parameter-based Exploration, uses two samples that are symmetric around the current hypothesis to circumvent misleading reward in \\emph{asymmetrical} reward distributed problems gathered with the usual baseline approach. The exploration parameters are still updated by a baseline approach - leaving the exploration prone to asymmetric reward distributions. In this paper we will show how the exploration parameters can be sampled quasi symmetric despite having limited instead of free parameters for exploration. We give a transformation approximation to get quasi symmetric samples with respect to the exploration without changing the overall sampling distribution. Finally we will demonstrate that sampling symmetrically also for the exploration parameters is superior in needs of samples and robustness than the original sampling approach."}
{"text": "  In this article we propose feature graph architectures (FGA), which are deep learning systems employing a structured initialisation and training method based on a feature graph which facilitates improved generalisation performance compared with a standard shallow architecture. The goal is to explore alternative perspectives on the problem of deep network training. We evaluate FGA performance for deep SVMs on some experimental datasets, and show how generalisation and stability results may be derived for these models. We describe the effect of permutations on the model accuracy, and give a criterion for the optimal permutation in terms of feature correlations. The experimental results show that the algorithm produces robust and significant test set improvements over a standard shallow SVM training method for a range of datasets. These gains are achieved with a moderate increase in time complexity."}
{"text": "  Mixtures of Experts combine the outputs of several \"expert\" networks, each of which specializes in a different part of the input space. This is achieved by training a \"gating\" network that maps each input to a distribution over the experts. Such models show promise for building larger networks that are still cheap to compute at test time, and more parallelizable at training time. In this this work, we extend the Mixture of Experts to a stacked model, the Deep Mixture of Experts, with multiple sets of gating and experts. This exponentially increases the number of effective experts by associating each input with a combination of experts at each layer, yet maintains a modest model size. On a randomly translated version of the MNIST dataset, we find that the Deep Mixture of Experts automatically learns to develop location-dependent (\"where\") experts at the first layer, and class-specific (\"what\") experts at the second layer. In addition, we see that the different combinations are in use when the model is applied to a dataset of speech monophones. These demonstrate effective use of all expert combinations."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose an extremely simple deep model for the unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction -- deep distributed random samplings, which performs like a stack of unsupervised bootstrap aggregating. First, its network structure is novel: each layer of the network is a group of mutually independent $k$-centers clusterings. Second, its learning method is extremely simple: the $k$ centers of each clustering are only $k$ randomly selected examples from the training data; for small-scale data sets, the $k$ centers are further randomly reconstructed by a simple cyclic-shift operation. Experimental results on nonlinear dimensionality reduction show that the proposed method can learn abstract representations on both large-scale and small-scale problems, and meanwhile is much faster than deep neural networks on large-scale problems."}
{"text": "  Scalability properties of deep neural networks raise key research questions, particularly as the problems considered become larger and more challenging. This paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced by Bengio, et. al., where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating units that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural networks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to the error introduced by the conditional computation process."}
{"text": "  Darwin's theory of evolution is considered to be one of the greatest scientific gems in modern science. It not only gives us a description of how living things evolve, but also shows how a population evolves through time and also, why only the fittest individuals continue the generation forward. The paper basically gives a high level analysis of the works of Valiant[1]. Though, we know the mechanisms of evolution, but it seems that there does not exist any strong quantitative and mathematical theory of the evolution of certain mechanisms. What is defined exactly as the fitness of an individual, why is that only certain individuals in a population tend to mutate, how computation is done in finite time when we have exponentially many examples: there seems to be a lot of questions which need to be answered. [1] basically treats Darwinian theory as a form of computational learning theory, which calculates the net fitness of the hypotheses and thus distinguishes functions and their classes which could be evolvable using polynomial amount of resources. Evolution is considered as a function of the environment and the previous evolutionary stages that chooses the best hypothesis using learning techniques that makes mutation possible and hence, gives a quantitative idea that why only the fittest individuals tend to survive and have the power to mutate."}
{"text": "  This paper addresses the problem of filtering with a state-space model. Standard approaches for filtering assume that a probabilistic model for observations (i.e. the observation model) is given explicitly or at least parametrically. We consider a setting where this assumption is not satisfied; we assume that the knowledge of the observation model is only provided by examples of state-observation pairs. This setting is important and appears when state variables are defined as quantities that are very different from the observations. We propose Kernel Monte Carlo Filter, a novel filtering method that is focused on this setting. Our approach is based on the framework of kernel mean embeddings, which enables nonparametric posterior inference using the state-observation examples. The proposed method represents state distributions as weighted samples, propagates these samples by sampling, estimates the state posteriors by Kernel Bayes' Rule, and resamples by Kernel Herding. In particular, the sampling and resampling procedures are novel in being expressed using kernel mean embeddings, so we theoretically analyze their behaviors. We reveal the following properties, which are similar to those of corresponding procedures in particle methods: (1) the performance of sampling can degrade if the effective sample size of a weighted sample is small; (2) resampling improves the sampling performance by increasing the effective sample size. We first demonstrate these theoretical findings by synthetic experiments. Then we show the effectiveness of the proposed filter by artificial and real data experiments, which include vision-based mobile robot localization."}
{"text": "  Real world systems typically feature a variety of different dependency types and topologies that complicate model selection for probabilistic graphical models. We introduce the ensemble-of-forests model, a generalization of the ensemble-of-trees model. Our model enables structure learning of Markov random fields (MRF) with multiple connected components and arbitrary potentials. We present two approximate inference techniques for this model and demonstrate their performance on synthetic data. Our results suggest that the ensemble-of-forests approach can accurately recover sparse, possibly disconnected MRF topologies, even in presence of non-Gaussian dependencies and/or low sample size. We applied the ensemble-of-forests model to learn the structure of perturbed signaling networks of immune cells and found that these frequently exhibit non-Gaussian dependencies with disconnected MRF topologies. In summary, we expect that the ensemble-of-forests model will enable MRF structure learning in other high dimensional real world settings that are governed by non-trivial dependencies."}
{"text": "  We are concerned with an approximation problem for a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix due to motivation from a class of nonlinear machine learning methods. We discuss an approximation approach that we call {matrix ridge approximation}. In particular, we define the matrix ridge approximation as an incomplete matrix factorization plus a ridge term. Moreover, we present probabilistic interpretations using a normal latent variable model and a Wishart model for this approximation approach. The idea behind the latent variable model in turn leads us to an efficient EM iterative method for handling the matrix ridge approximation problem. Finally, we illustrate the applications of the approximation approach in multivariate data analysis. Empirical studies in spectral clustering and Gaussian process regression show that the matrix ridge approximation with the EM iteration is potentially useful."}
{"text": "  In this paper we study nonconvex penalization using Bernstein functions. Since the Bernstein function is concave and nonsmooth at the origin, it can induce a class of nonconvex functions for high-dimensional sparse estimation problems. We derive a threshold function based on the Bernstein penalty and give its mathematical properties in sparsity modeling. We show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for penalized regression problems with the Bernstein penalty. Additionally, we prove that the Bernstein function can be defined as the concave conjugate of a $\\varphi$-divergence and develop a conjugate maximization algorithm for finding the sparse solution. Finally, we particularly exemplify a family of Bernstein nonconvex penalties based on a generalized Gamma measure and conduct empirical analysis for this family."}
{"text": "  Not all instances in a data set are equally beneficial for inferring a model of the data. Some instances (such as outliers) are detrimental to inferring a model of the data. Several machine learning techniques treat instances in a data set differently during training such as curriculum learning, filtering, and boosting. However, an automated method for determining how beneficial an instance is for inferring a model of the data does not exist. In this paper, we present an automated method that orders the instances in a data set by complexity based on the their likelihood of being misclassified (instance hardness). The underlying assumption of this method is that instances with a high likelihood of being misclassified represent more complex concepts in a data set. Ordering the instances in a data set allows a learning algorithm to focus on the most beneficial instances and ignore the detrimental ones. We compare ordering the instances in a data set in curriculum learning, filtering and boosting. We find that ordering the instances significantly increases classification accuracy and that filtering has the largest impact on classification accuracy. On a set of 52 data sets, ordering the instances increases the average accuracy from 81% to 84%."}
{"text": "  Bootstrapping is a useful technique for estimating the uncertainty of a predictor, for example, confidence intervals for prediction. It is typically used on small to moderate sized datasets, due to its high computation cost. This work describes a highly scalable online bootstrapping strategy, implemented inside Vowpal Wabbit, that is several times faster than traditional strategies. Our experiments indicate that, in addition to providing a black box-like method for estimating uncertainty, our implementation of online bootstrapping may also help to train models with better prediction performance due to model averaging."}
{"text": "  It is the main goal of this article to address the bipartite ranking issue from the perspective of functional data analysis (FDA). Given a training set of independent realizations of a (possibly sampled) second-order random function with a (locally) smooth autocorrelation structure and to which a binary label is randomly assigned, the objective is to learn a scoring function s with optimal ROC curve. Based on linear/nonlinear wavelet-based approximations, it is shown how to select compact finite dimensional representations of the input curves adaptively, in order to build accurate ranking rules, using recent advances in the ranking problem for multivariate data with binary feedback. Beyond theoretical considerations, the performance of the learning methods for functional bipartite ranking proposed in this paper are illustrated by numerical experiments."}
{"text": "  Probabilistic models often have parameters that can be translated, scaled, permuted, or otherwise transformed without changing the model. These symmetries can lead to strong correlation and multimodality in the posterior distribution over the model's parameters, which can pose challenges both for performing inference and interpreting the results. In this work, we address the automatic detection of common problematic model symmetries. To do so, we introduce local symmetries, which cover many common cases and are amenable to automatic detection. We show how to derive algorithms to detect several broad classes of local symmetries. Our algorithms are compatible with probabilistic programming constructs such as arrays, for loops, and if statements, and they scale to models with many variables."}
{"text": "  Neural networks have recently been proposed for multi-label classification because they are able to capture and model label dependencies in the output layer. In this work, we investigate limitations of BP-MLL, a neural network (NN) architecture that aims at minimizing pairwise ranking error. Instead, we propose to use a comparably simple NN approach with recently proposed learning techniques for large-scale multi-label text classification tasks. In particular, we show that BP-MLL's ranking loss minimization can be efficiently and effectively replaced with the commonly used cross entropy error function, and demonstrate that several advances in neural network training that have been developed in the realm of deep learning can be effectively employed in this setting. Our experimental results show that simple NN models equipped with advanced techniques such as rectified linear units, dropout, and AdaGrad perform as well as or even outperform state-of-the-art approaches on six large-scale textual datasets with diverse characteristics."}
{"text": "  We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them."}
{"text": "  Several recent publications have proposed methods for mapping images into continuous semantic embedding spaces. In some cases the embedding space is trained jointly with the image transformation. In other cases the semantic embedding space is established by an independent natural language processing task, and then the image transformation into that space is learned in a second stage. Proponents of these image embedding systems have stressed their advantages over the traditional \\nway{} classification framing of image understanding, particularly in terms of the promise for zero-shot learning -- the ability to correctly annotate images of previously unseen object categories. In this paper, we propose a simple method for constructing an image embedding system from any existing \\nway{} image classifier and a semantic word embedding model, which contains the $\\n$ class labels in its vocabulary. Our method maps images into the semantic embedding space via convex combination of the class label embedding vectors, and requires no additional training. We show that this simple and direct method confers many of the advantages associated with more complex image embedding schemes, and indeed outperforms state of the art methods on the ImageNet zero-shot learning task."}
{"text": "  Recently, it has been observed that when representations are learnt in a way that encourages sparsity, improved performance is obtained on classification tasks. These methods involve combinations of activation functions, sampling steps and different kinds of penalties. To investigate the effectiveness of sparsity by itself, we propose the k-sparse autoencoder, which is an autoencoder with linear activation function, where in hidden layers only the k highest activities are kept. When applied to the MNIST and NORB datasets, we find that this method achieves better classification results than denoising autoencoders, networks trained with dropout, and RBMs. k-sparse autoencoders are simple to train and the encoding stage is very fast, making them well-suited to large problem sizes, where conventional sparse coding algorithms cannot be applied."}
{"text": "  Recent non-linear feature selection approaches employing greedy optimisation of Centred Kernel Target Alignment(KTA) exhibit strong results in terms of generalisation accuracy and sparsity. However, they are computationally prohibitive for large datasets. We propose randSel, a randomised feature selection algorithm, with attractive scaling properties. Our theoretical analysis of randSel provides strong probabilistic guarantees for correct identification of relevant features. RandSel's characteristics make it an ideal candidate for identifying informative learned representations. We've conducted experimentation to establish the performance of this approach, and present encouraging results, including a 3rd position result in the recent ICML black box learning challenge as well as competitive results for signal peptide prediction, an important problem in bioinformatics."}
{"text": "  Modeling structure in complex networks using Bayesian non-parametrics makes it possible to specify flexible model structures and infer the adequate model complexity from the observed data. This paper provides a gentle introduction to non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks: Using an infinite mixture model as running example we go through the steps of deriving the model as an infinite limit of a finite parametric model, inferring the model parameters by Markov chain Monte Carlo, and checking the model's fit and predictive performance. We explain how advanced non-parametric models for complex networks can be derived and point out relevant literature."}

{"text": "  Optimization by stochastic gradient descent is an important component of many large-scale machine learning algorithms. A wide variety of such optimization algorithms have been devised; however, it is unclear whether these algorithms are robust and widely applicable across many different optimization landscapes. In this paper we develop a collection of unit tests for stochastic optimization. Each unit test rapidly evaluates an optimization algorithm on a small-scale, isolated, and well-understood difficulty, rather than in real-world scenarios where many such issues are entangled. Passing these unit tests is not sufficient, but absolutely necessary for any algorithms with claims to generality or robustness. We give initial quantitative and qualitative results on numerous established algorithms. The testing framework is open-source, extensible, and easy to apply to new algorithms."}
{"text": "  Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are general unsupervised learning devices to ascertain generative models of data distributions. RBMs are often trained using the Contrastive Divergence learning algorithm (CD), an approximation to the gradient of the data log-likelihood. A simple reconstruction error is often used to decide whether the approximation provided by the CD algorithm is good enough, though several authors (Schulz et al., 2010; Fischer & Igel, 2010) have raised doubts concerning the feasibility of this procedure. However, not many alternatives to the reconstruction error have been used in the literature. In this manuscript we investigate simple alternatives to the reconstruction error in order to detect as soon as possible the decrease in the log-likelihood during learning."}
{"text": "  Within the framework of AdaBoost.MH, we propose to train vector-valued decision trees to optimize the multi-class edge without reducing the multi-class problem to $K$ binary one-against-all classifications. The key element of the method is a vector-valued decision stump, factorized into an input-independent vector of length $K$ and label-independent scalar classifier. At inner tree nodes, the label-dependent vector is discarded and the binary classifier can be used for partitioning the input space into two regions. The algorithm retains the conceptual elegance, power, and computational efficiency of binary AdaBoost. In experiments it is on par with support vector machines and with the best existing multi-class boosting algorithm AOSOLogitBoost, and it is significantly better than other known implementations of AdaBoost.MH."}

In this paper, we propose a method and efficient algorithm for ranking and selecting representations from a Restricted Boltzmann Machine trained on a source domain to be transferred onto a target domain. Experiments carried out using the MNIST, ICDAR and TiCC image datasets show that the proposed adaptive feature ranking and transfer learning method offers statistically significant improvements on the training of RBMs. Our method is general in that the knowledge chosen by the ranking function does not depend on its relation to any specific target domain, and it works with unsupervised learning and knowledge-based transfer."}
{"text": "  Learning probabilistic models over strings is an important issue for many applications. Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of inferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings drawn from an unknown target distribution. These methods rely on a singular value decomposition of a matrix $H_S$, called the Hankel matrix, that records the frequencies of (some of) the observed strings. The accuracy of the learned distribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in $H_S$ and on the distance between $H_S$ and its mean $H_r$. Existing concentration bounds seem to indicate that the concentration over $H_r$ gets looser with the size of $H_r$, suggesting to make a trade-off between the quantity of used information and the size of $H_r$. We propose new dimension-free concentration bounds for several variants of Hankel matrices. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds are tight and that they significantly improve existing bounds. These results suggest that the concentration rate of the Hankel matrix around its mean does not constitute an argument for limiting its size."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose an outlier-robust regularized kernel-based method for linear system identification. The unknown impulse response is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) is given by the recently proposed stable spline kernel, which encodes information on regularity and exponential stability. To build robustness to outliers, we model the measurement noise as realizations of independent Laplacian random variables. The identification problem is cast in a Bayesian framework, and solved by a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme. In particular, exploiting the representation of the Laplacian random variables as scale mixtures of Gaussians, we design a Gibbs sampler which quickly converges to the target distribution. Numerical simulations show a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the estimates over state-of-the-art kernel-based methods."}
{"text": "  Time-series classification is an important domain of machine learning and a plethora of methods have been developed for the task. In comparison to existing approaches, this study presents a novel method which decomposes a time-series dataset into latent patterns and membership weights of local segments to those patterns. The process is formalized as a constrained objective function and a tailored stochastic coordinate descent optimization is applied. The time-series are projected to a new feature representation consisting of the sums of the membership weights, which captures frequencies of local patterns. Features from various sliding window sizes are concatenated in order to encapsulate the interaction of patterns from different sizes. Finally, a large-scale experimental comparison against 6 state of the art baselines and 43 real life datasets is conducted. The proposed method outperforms all the baselines with statistically significant margins in terms of prediction accuracy."}
{"text": "  Transductive graph-based semi-supervised learning methods usually build an undirected graph utilizing both labeled and unlabeled samples as vertices. Those methods propagate label information of labeled samples to neighbors through their edges in order to get the predicted labels of unlabeled samples. Most popular semi-supervised learning approaches are sensitive to initial label distribution happened in imbalanced labeled datasets. The class boundary will be severely skewed by the majority classes in an imbalanced classification. In this paper, we proposed a simple and effective approach to alleviate the unfavorable influence of imbalance problem by iteratively selecting a few unlabeled samples and adding them into the minority classes to form a balanced labeled dataset for the learning methods afterwards. The experiments on UCI datasets and MNIST handwritten digits dataset showed that the proposed approach outperforms other existing state-of-art methods."}
{"text": "  A rekindled the interest in auto-encoder algorithms has been spurred by recent work on deep learning. Current efforts have been directed towards effective training of auto-encoder architectures with a large number of coding units. Here, we propose a learning algorithm for auto-encoders based on a rate-distortion objective that minimizes the mutual information between the inputs and the outputs of the auto-encoder subject to a fidelity constraint. The goal is to learn a representation that is minimally committed to the input data, but that is rich enough to reconstruct the inputs up to certain level of distortion. Minimizing the mutual information acts as a regularization term whereas the fidelity constraint can be understood as a risk functional in the conventional statistical learning setting. The proposed algorithm uses a recently introduced measure of entropy based on infinitely divisible matrices that avoids the plug in estimation of densities. Experiments using over-complete bases show that the rate-distortion auto-encoders can learn a regularized input-output mapping in an implicit manner."}
{"text": "  We consider a problem of clustering a sequence of multinomial observations by way of a model selection criterion. We propose a form of a penalty term for the model selection procedure. Our approach subsumes both the conventional AIC and BIC criteria but also extends the conventional criteria in a way that it can be applicable also to a sequence of sparse multinomial observations, where even within a same cluster, the number of multinomial trials may be different for different observations. In addition, as a preliminary estimation step to maximum likelihood estimation, and more generally, to maximum $L_{q}$ estimation, we propose to use reduced rank projection in combination with non-negative factorization. We motivate our approach by showing that our model selection criterion and preliminary estimation step yield consistent estimates under simplifying assumptions. We also illustrate our approach through numerical experiments using real and simulated data."}
{"text": "  Archetypal analysis represents a set of observations as convex combinations of pure patterns, or archetypes. The original geometric formulation of finding archetypes by approximating the convex hull of the observations assumes them to be real valued. This, unfortunately, is not compatible with many practical situations. In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better."}
{"text": "  Multi-task learning has shown to significantly enhance the performance of multiple related learning tasks in a variety of situations. We present the fused logistic regression, a sparse multi-task learning approach for binary classification. Specifically, we introduce sparsity inducing penalties over parameter differences of related logistic regression models to encode similarity across related tasks. The resulting joint learning task is cast into a form that lends itself to be efficiently optimized with a recursive variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers. We show results on synthetic data and describe the regime of settings where our multi-task approach achieves significant improvements over the single task learning approach and discuss the implications on applying the fused logistic regression in different real world settings."}
{"text": "  When belief propagation (BP) converges, it does so to a stationary point of the Bethe free energy $F$, and is often strikingly accurate. However, it may converge only to a local optimum or may not converge at all. An algorithm was recently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to return an $\\epsilon$-approximation to the global minimum of $F$ in polynomial time provided the maximum degree $\\Delta=O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables. Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several results including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of $F$, which leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any degree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive) models, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the important result that approximating $\\log$ of the Bethe partition function, $\\log Z_B=-\\min F$, for a general model to additive $\\epsilon$-accuracy may be reduced to a discrete MAP inference problem. We explore an application to predicting equipment failure on an urban power network and demonstrate that the Bethe approximation can perform well even when BP fails to converge."}
{"text": "  We consider forward-backward greedy algorithms for solving sparse feature selection problems with general convex smooth functions. A state-of-the-art greedy method, the Forward-Backward greedy algorithm (FoBa-obj) requires to solve a large number of optimization problems, thus it is not scalable for large-size problems. The FoBa-gdt algorithm, which uses the gradient information for feature selection at each forward iteration, significantly improves the efficiency of FoBa-obj. In this paper, we systematically analyze the theoretical properties of both forward-backward greedy algorithms. Our main contributions are: 1) We derive better theoretical bounds than existing analyses regarding FoBa-obj for general smooth convex functions; 2) We show that FoBa-gdt achieves the same theoretical performance as FoBa-obj under the same condition: restricted strong convexity condition. Our new bounds are consistent with the bounds of a special case (least squares) and fills a previously existing theoretical gap for general convex smooth functions; 3) We show that the restricted strong convexity condition is satisfied if the number of independent samples is more than $\\bar{k}\\log d$ where $\\bar{k}$ is the sparsity number and $d$ is the dimension of the variable; 4) We apply FoBa-gdt (with the conditional random field objective) to the sensor selection problem for human indoor activity recognition and our results show that FoBa-gdt outperforms other methods (including the ones based on forward greedy selection and L1-regularization)."}
{"text": "  Multiple Kernel Learning(MKL) on Support Vector Machines(SVMs) has been a popular front of research in recent times due to its success in application problems like Object Categorization. This success is due to the fact that MKL has the ability to choose from a variety of feature kernels to identify the optimal kernel combination. But the initial formulation of MKL was only able to select the best of the features and misses out many other informative kernels presented. To overcome this, the Lp norm based formulation was proposed by Kloft et. al. This formulation is capable of choosing a non-sparse set of kernels through a control parameter p. Unfortunately, the parameter p does not have a direct meaning to the number of kernels selected. We have observed that stricter control over the number of kernels selected gives us an edge over these techniques in terms of accuracy of classification and also helps us to fine tune the algorithms to the time requirements at hand. In this work, we propose a Controlled Sparsity Kernel Learning (CSKL) formulation that can strictly control the number of kernels which we wish to select. The CSKL formulation introduces a parameter t which directly corresponds to the number of kernels selected. It is important to note that a search in t space is finite and fast as compared to p. We have also provided an efficient Reduced Gradient Descent based algorithm to solve the CSKL formulation, which is proven to converge. Through our experiments on the Caltech101 Object Categorization dataset, we have also shown that one can achieve better accuracies than the previous formulations through the right choice of t."}
{"text": "  Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a nonparametric representation of functions. However, classical GP inference suffers from high computational cost for big data. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian approach, EigenGP, that learns both basis dictionary elements--eigenfunctions of a GP prior--and prior precisions in a sparse finite model. It is well known that, among all orthogonal basis functions, eigenfunctions can provide the most compact representation. Unlike other sparse Bayesian finite models where the basis function has a fixed form, our eigenfunctions live in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space as a finite linear combination of kernel functions. We learn the dictionary elements--eigenfunctions--and the prior precisions over these elements as well as all the other hyperparameters from data by maximizing the model marginal likelihood. We explore computational linear algebra to simplify the gradient computation significantly. Our experimental results demonstrate improved predictive performance of EigenGP over alternative sparse GP methods as well as relevance vector machine."}
{"text": "  Motivated by applications in energy management, this paper presents the Multi-Armed Risk-Aware Bandit (MARAB) algorithm. With the goal of limiting the exploration of risky arms, MARAB takes as arm quality its conditional value at risk. When the user-supplied risk level goes to 0, the arm quality tends toward the essential infimum of the arm distribution density, and MARAB tends toward the MIN multi-armed bandit algorithm, aimed at the arm with maximal minimal value. As a first contribution, this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the MIN algorithm under mild assumptions, establishing its robustness comparatively to UCB. The analysis is supported by extensive experimental validation of MIN and MARAB compared to UCB and state-of-art risk-aware MAB algorithms on artificial and real-world problems."}
{"text": "  In recent years, there has been growing focus on the study of automated recommender systems. Music recommendation systems serve as a prominent domain for such works, both from an academic and a commercial perspective. A fundamental aspect of music perception is that music is experienced in temporal context and in sequence. In this work we present DJ-MC, a novel reinforcement-learning framework for music recommendation that does not recommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on a model of preferences for both songs and song transitions. The model is learned online and is uniquely adapted for each listener. To reduce exploration time, DJ-MC exploits user feedback to initialize a model, which it subsequently updates by reinforcement. We evaluate our framework with human participants using both real song and playlist data. Our results indicate that DJ-MC's ability to recommend sequences of songs provides a significant improvement over more straightforward approaches, which do not take transitions into account."}
{"text": "  This paper develops a theory of clustering and coding which combines a geometric model with a probabilistic model in a principled way. The geometric model is a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric, ${g}_{ij}({\\bf x})$, which we interpret as a measure of dissimilarity. The probabilistic model consists of a stochastic process with an invariant probability measure which matches the density of the sample input data. The link between the two models is a potential function, $U({\\bf x})$, and its gradient, $\\nabla U({\\bf x})$. We use the gradient to define the dissimilarity metric, which guarantees that our measure of dissimilarity will depend on the probability measure. Finally, we use the dissimilarity metric to define a coordinate system on the embedded Riemannian manifold, which gives us a low-dimensional encoding of our original data."}
{"text": "  It is the main goal of this paper to propose a novel method to perform matrix completion on-line. Motivated by a wide variety of applications, ranging from the design of recommender systems to sensor network localization through seismic data reconstruction, we consider the matrix completion problem when entries of the matrix of interest are observed gradually. Precisely, we place ourselves in the situation where the predictive rule should be refined incrementally, rather than recomputed from scratch each time the sample of observed entries increases. The extension of existing matrix completion methods to the sequential prediction context is indeed a major issue in the Big Data era, and yet little addressed in the literature. The algorithm promoted in this article builds upon the Soft Impute approach introduced in Mazumder et al. (2010). The major novelty essentially arises from the use of a randomised technique for both computing and updating the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) involved in the algorithm. Though of disarming simplicity, the method proposed turns out to be very efficient, while requiring reduced computations. Several numerical experiments based on real datasets illustrating its performance are displayed, together with preliminary results giving it a theoretical basis."}
{"text": "  A new shrinkage-based construction is developed for a compressible vector $\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$, for cases in which the components of $\\xv$ are naturally associated with a tree structure. Important examples are when $\\xv$ corresponds to the coefficients of a wavelet or block-DCT representation of data. The method we consider in detail, and for which numerical results are presented, is based on increments of a gamma process. However, we demonstrate that the general framework is appropriate for many other types of shrinkage priors, all within the L\\'{e}vy process family, with the gamma process a special case. Bayesian inference is carried out by approximating the posterior with samples from an MCMC algorithm, as well as by constructing a heuristic variational approximation to the posterior. We also consider expectation-maximization (EM) for a MAP (point) solution. State-of-the-art results are manifested for compressive sensing and denoising applications, the latter with spiky (non-Gaussian) noise."}
{"text": "  Recently, a number of mostly $\\ell_1$-norm regularized least squares type deterministic algorithms have been proposed to address the problem of \\emph{sparse} adaptive signal estimation and system identification. From a Bayesian perspective, this task is equivalent to maximum a posteriori probability estimation under a sparsity promoting heavy-tailed prior for the parameters of interest. Following a different approach, this paper develops a unifying framework of sparse \\emph{variational Bayes} algorithms that employ heavy-tailed priors in conjugate hierarchical form to facilitate posterior inference. The resulting fully automated variational schemes are first presented in a batch iterative form. Then it is shown that by properly exploiting the structure of the batch estimation task, new sparse adaptive variational Bayes algorithms can be derived, which have the ability to impose and track sparsity during real-time processing in a time-varying environment. The most important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they completely eliminate the need for computationally costly parameter fine-tuning, a necessary ingredient of sparse adaptive deterministic algorithms. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sparse variational Bayes algorithms against state-of-the-art deterministic techniques for adaptive channel estimation. The results show that the proposed algorithms are numerically robust and exhibit in general superior estimation performance compared to their deterministic counterparts."}
{"text": "  In this work we consider the problem of detecting anomalous spatio-temporal behavior in videos. Our approach is to learn the normative multiframe pixel joint distribution and detect deviations from it using a likelihood based approach. Due to the extreme lack of available training samples relative to the dimension of the distribution, we use a mean and covariance approach and consider methods of learning the spatio-temporal covariance in the low-sample regime. Our approach is to estimate the covariance using parameter reduction and sparse models. The first method considered is the representation of the covariance as a sum of Kronecker products as in (Greenewald et al 2013), which is found to be an accurate approximation in this setting. We propose learning algorithms relevant to our problem. We then consider the sparse multiresolution model of (Choi et al 2010) and apply the Kronecker product methods to it for further parameter reduction, as well as introducing modifications for enhanced efficiency and greater applicability to spatio-temporal covariance matrices. We apply our methods to the detection of crowd behavior anomalies in the University of Minnesota crowd anomaly dataset, and achieve competitive results."}
{"text": "  In this survey, we present and compare different approaches to estimate Mutual Information (MI) from data to analyse general dependencies between variables of interest in a system. We demonstrate the performance difference of MI versus correlation analysis, which is only optimal in case of linear dependencies. First, we use a piece-wise constant Bayesian methodology using a general Dirichlet prior. In this estimation method, we use a two-stage approach where we approximate the probability distribution first and then calculate the marginal and joint entropies. Here, we demonstrate the performance of this Bayesian approach versus the others for computing the dependency between different variables. We also compare these with linear correlation analysis. Finally, we apply MI and correlation analysis to the identification of the bias in the determination of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) by the satellite based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the ground based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Here, we observe that the AOD measurements by these two instruments might be different for the same location. The reason of this bias is explored by quantifying the dependencies between the bias and 15 other variables including cloud cover, surface reflectivity and others."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel method for approximate inference in Bayesian networks (BNs). The idea is to sample data from a BN, learn a latent tree model (LTM) from the data offline, and when online, make inference with the LTM instead of the original BN. Because LTMs are tree-structured, inference takes linear time. In the meantime, they can represent complex relationship among leaf nodes and hence the approximation accuracy is often good. Empirical evidence shows that our method can achieve good approximation accuracy at low online computational cost."}
{"text": "  The paper investigates stochastic resource allocation problems with scarce, reusable resources and non-preemtive, time-dependent, interconnected tasks. This approach is a natural generalization of several standard resource management problems, such as scheduling and transportation problems. First, reactive solutions are considered and defined as control policies of suitably reformulated Markov decision processes (MDPs). We argue that this reformulation has several favorable properties, such as it has finite state and action spaces, it is aperiodic, hence all policies are proper and the space of control policies can be safely restricted. Next, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods, such as fitted Q-learning, are suggested for computing an efficient control policy. In order to compactly maintain the cost-to-go function, two representations are studied: hash tables and support vector regression (SVR), particularly, nu-SVRs. Several additional improvements, such as the application of limited-lookahead rollout algorithms in the initial phases, action space decomposition, task clustering and distributed sampling are investigated, too. Finally, experimental results on both benchmark and industry-related data are presented."}
{"text": "  Machine learning techniques are gaining prevalence in the production of a wide range of classifiers for complex real-world applications with nonuniform testing and misclassification costs. The increasing complexity of these applications poses a real challenge to resource management during learning and classification. In this work we introduce ACT (anytime cost-sensitive tree learner), a novel framework for operating in such complex environments. ACT is an anytime algorithm that allows learning time to be increased in return for lower classification costs. It builds a tree top-down and exploits additional time resources to obtain better estimations for the utility of the different candidate splits. Using sampling techniques, ACT approximates the cost of the subtree under each candidate split and favors the one with a minimal cost. As a stochastic algorithm, ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into which greedy methods may be trapped. Experiments with a variety of datasets were conducted to compare ACT to the state-of-the-art cost-sensitive tree learners. The results show that for the majority of domains ACT produces significantly less costly trees. ACT also exhibits good anytime behavior with diminishing returns."}
{"text": "  In this paper we apply Conformal Prediction (CP) to the k-Nearest Neighbours Regression (k-NNR) algorithm and propose ways of extending the typical nonconformity measure used for regression so far. Unlike traditional regression methods which produce point predictions, Conformal Predictors output predictive regions that satisfy a given confidence level. The regions produced by any Conformal Predictor are automatically valid, however their tightness and therefore usefulness depends on the nonconformity measure used by each CP. In effect a nonconformity measure evaluates how strange a given example is compared to a set of other examples based on some traditional machine learning algorithm. We define six novel nonconformity measures based on the k-Nearest Neighbours Regression algorithm and develop the corresponding CPs following both the original (transductive) and the inductive CP approaches. A comparison of the predictive regions produced by our measures with those of the typical regression measure suggests that a major improvement in terms of predictive region tightness is achieved by the new measures."}
{"text": "  Tree structured graphical models are powerful at expressing long range or hierarchical dependency among many variables, and have been widely applied in different areas of computer science and statistics. However, existing methods for parameter estimation, inference, and structure learning mainly rely on the Gaussian or discrete assumptions, which are restrictive under many applications. In this paper, we propose new nonparametric methods based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space embeddings of distributions that can recover the latent tree structures, estimate the parameters, and perform inference for high dimensional continuous and non-Gaussian variables. The usefulness of the proposed methods are illustrated by thorough numerical results."}
{"text": "  Multiclass problems are often decomposed into multiple binary problems that are solved by individual binary classifiers whose results are integrated into a final answer. Various methods, including all-pairs (APs), one-versus-all (OVA), and error correcting output code (ECOC), have been studied, to decompose multiclass problems into binary problems. However, little study has been made to optimally aggregate binary problems to determine a final answer to the multiclass problem. In this paper we present a convex optimization method for an optimal aggregation of binary classifiers to estimate class membership probabilities in multiclass problems. We model the class membership probability as a softmax function which takes a conic combination of discrepancies induced by individual binary classifiers, as an input. With this model, we formulate the regularized maximum likelihood estimation as a convex optimization problem, which is solved by the primal-dual interior point method. Connections of our method to large margin classifiers are presented, showing that the large margin formulation can be considered as a limiting case of our convex formulation. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing aggregation methods as well as direct methods, in terms of the classification accuracy and the quality of class membership probability estimates."}
{"text": "  Visual rendering of graphs is a key task in the mapping of complex network data. Although most graph drawing algorithms emphasize aesthetic appeal, certain applications such as travel-time maps place more importance on visualization of structural network properties. The present paper advocates two graph embedding approaches with centrality considerations to comply with node hierarchy. The problem is formulated first as one of constrained multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and it is solved via block coordinate descent iterations with successive approximations and guaranteed convergence to a KKT point. In addition, a regularization term enforcing graph smoothness is incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. A second approach leverages the locally-linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which assumes that the graph encodes data sampled from a low-dimensional manifold. Closed-form solutions to the resulting centrality-constrained optimization problems are determined yielding meaningful embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both approaches, especially for visualizing large networks on the order of thousands of nodes."}
{"text": "  Undirected graphical models known as Markov networks are popular for a wide variety of applications ranging from statistical physics to computational biology. Traditionally, learning of the network structure has been done under the assumption of chordality which ensures that efficient scoring methods can be used. In general, non-chordal graphs have intractable normalizing constants which renders the calculation of Bayesian and other scores difficult beyond very small-scale systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest towards the use of regularized pseudo-likelihood methods for structural learning of large-scale Markov network models, as such an approach avoids the assumption of chordality. The currently available methods typically necessitate the use of a tuning parameter to adapt the level of regularization for a particular dataset, which can be optimized for example by cross-validation. Here we introduce a Bayesian version of pseudo-likelihood scoring of Markov networks, which enables an automatic regularization through marginalization over the nuisance parameters in the model. We prove consistency of the resulting MPL estimator for the network structure via comparison with the pseudo information criterion. Identification of the MPL-optimal network on a prescanned graph space is considered with both greedy hill climbing and exact pseudo-Boolean optimization algorithms. We find that for reasonable sample sizes the hill climbing approach most often identifies networks that are at a negligible distance from the restricted global optimum. Using synthetic and existing benchmark networks, the marginal pseudo-likelihood method is shown to generally perform favorably against recent popular inference methods for Markov networks."}
{"text": "  Over the past few years, Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) has received significant attention among data-driven feature selection techniques in the context of kernel-based learning. MKL formulations have been devised and solved for a broad spectrum of machine learning problems, including Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Solving different MKL formulations usually involves designing algorithms that are tailored to the problem at hand, which is, typically, a non-trivial accomplishment.   In this paper we present a general Multi-Task Multi-Kernel Learning (Multi-Task MKL) framework that subsumes well-known Multi-Task MKL formulations, as well as several important MKL approaches on single-task problems. We then derive a simple algorithm that can solve the unifying framework. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed framework, we formulate a new learning problem, namely Partially-Shared Common Space (PSCS) Multi-Task MKL, and demonstrate its merits through experimentation."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes a novel scheme for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. On this approximate eigenbasis the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$ (initial) and $\\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ (hyperparameter learning) with $m$ basis functions and $n$ data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function is increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by ${\\sim}1/m$ regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data."}
{"text": "  The notion of causality is used in many situations dealing with uncertainty. We consider the problem whether causality can be identified given data set generated by discrete random variables rather than continuous ones. In particular, for non-binary data, thus far it was only known that causality can be identified except rare cases. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient condition for an integer modular acyclic additive noise (IMAN) of two variables. In addition, we relate bivariate and multivariate causal identifiability in a more explicit manner, and develop a practical algorithm to find the order of variables and their parent sets. We demonstrate its performance in applications to artificial data and real world body motion data with comparisons to conventional methods."}
{"text": "  An extreme learning machine (ELM) can be regarded as a two stage feed-forward neural network (FNN) learning system which randomly assigns the connections with and within hidden neurons in the first stage and tunes the connections with output neurons in the second stage. Therefore, ELM training is essentially a linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational burden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction does not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that whether this is true in theory. The aim of our work is to study the theoretical feasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part on this topic, we pointed out that via appropriate selection of the activation function, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the expectation sense. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show that the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one hand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of ELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically justify that there also exists an activation function such that the corresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we prove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is essentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use of ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the well-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the generalization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential characteristic of ELM and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM."}

In this technical report, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state excess mean-square error (EMSE) for the four algorithms. Simulations results illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical results. This is a complementary material to our previous work."}
{"text": "  Distributions over rankings are used to model data in a multitude of real world settings such as preference analysis and political elections. Modeling such distributions presents several computational challenges, however, due to the factorial size of the set of rankings over an item set. Some of these challenges are quite familiar to the artificial intelligence community, such as how to compactly represent a distribution over a combinatorially large space, and how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these representations. With respect to ranking, however, there is the additional challenge of what we refer to as human task complexity users are rarely willing to provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates, instead often preferring to provide partial ranking information. Simultaneously addressing all of these challenges i.e., designing a compactly representable model which is amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking data is a difficult task, but is necessary if we would like to scale to problems with nontrivial size. In this paper, we show that the recently proposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each of the above challenges. In particular, we establish a tight mathematical connection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial rankings. This correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and exact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence based represen- tations with partial rankings, but somewhat surprisingly, also shows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models (in a certain sense) with observations which do not take the form of partial rankings. Finally, using our inference algorithm, we introduce the first method for learning riffled independence based models from partially ranked data."}
{"text": "  Anomaly detection is being regarded as an unsupervised learning task as anomalies stem from adversarial or unlikely events with unknown distributions. However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our first contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from a supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions. Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection accuracies."}

Then minimizing $\\Vert z \\Vert_1$ subject to $\\Vert y - Az \\Vert_2 \\leq \\epsilon$ leads to an estimate $\\hat{x}$ whose error $\\Vert \\hat{x} - x \\Vert_2$ is bounded by a universal constant times the error achieved by an \"oracle\" that knows the location of the nonzero components of $x$. In the world of optimization, the LASSO algorithm has been generalized in several directions such as the group LASSO, the sparse group LASSO, either without or with tree-structured overlapping groups, and most recently, the sorted LASSO. In this paper, it is shown that {\\it any algorithm\\/} exhibits near-ideal behavior in the above sense, provided only that (i) the norm used to define the sparsity index is \"decomposable,\" (ii) the penalty norm that is minimized in an effort to enforce sparsity is \"$\\gamma$-decomposable,\" and (iii) a \"compressibility condition\" in terms of a group restricted isometry property is satisfied. Specifically, the group LASSO, and the sparse group LASSO (with some permissible overlap in the groups), as well as the sorted $\\ell_1$-norm minimization all exhibit near-ideal behavior. Explicit bounds on the residual error are derived that contain previously known results as special cases."}
{"text": "  Sparse classifiers such as the support vector machines (SVM) are efficient in test-phases because the classifier is characterized only by a subset of the samples called support vectors (SVs), and the rest of the samples (non SVs) have no influence on the classification result. However, the advantage of the sparsity has not been fully exploited in training phases because it is generally difficult to know which sample turns out to be SV beforehand. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called safe sample screening that enables us to identify a subset of the non-SVs and screen them out prior to the training phase. Our approach is different from existing heuristic approaches in the sense that the screened samples are guaranteed to be non-SVs at the optimal solution. We investigate the advantage of the safe sample screening approach through intensive numerical experiments, and demonstrate that it can substantially decrease the computational cost of the state-of-the-art SVM solvers such as LIBSVM. In the current big data era, we believe that safe sample screening would be of great practical importance since the data size can be reduced without sacrificing the optimality of the final solution."}
{"text": "  In this paper we demonstrate that tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for Bayesian models by recursively subsampling observations without replacement can improve the performance of baseline samplers in terms of effective sample size per computation. We present two tempering by subsampling algorithms, subsampled parallel tempering and subsampled tempered transitions. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the computational cost of tempering by subsampling, verify that tempering by subsampling costs less than traditional tempering, and demonstrate both algorithms on Bayesian approaches to learning the mean of a high dimensional multivariate Normal and estimating Gaussian process hyperparameters."}
{"text": "  This paper is about variable selection, clustering and estimation in an unsupervised high-dimensional setting. Our approach is based on fitting constrained Gaussian mixture models, where we learn the number of clusters $K$ and the set of relevant variables $S$ using a generalized Bayesian posterior with a sparsity inducing prior. We prove a sparsity oracle inequality which shows that this procedure selects the optimal parameters $K$ and $S$. This procedure is implemented using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, based on a clustering-oriented greedy proposal, which makes the convergence to the posterior very fast."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) framework for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency between a structured input space and a structured output space. Our formulation encompasses both Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Co-regularized Multi-view Learning, providing in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of the least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution, which is obtained by solving a system of linear equations. In the case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, our formulation generalizes in particular both the binary Laplacian SVM to the multi-class, multi-view settings and the multi-class Simplex Cone SVM to the semi-supervised, multi-view settings. The solution is obtained by solving a single quadratic optimization problem, as in standard SVM, via the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) approach. Empirical results obtained on the task of object recognition, using several challenging datasets, demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithms compared with other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  An inductive probabilistic classification rule must generally obey the principles of Bayesian predictive inference, such that all observed and unobserved stochastic quantities are jointly modeled and the parameter uncertainty is fully acknowledged through the posterior predictive distribution. Several such rules have been recently considered and their asymptotic behavior has been characterized under the assumption that the observed features or variables used for building a classifier are conditionally independent given a simultaneous labeling of both the training samples and those from an unknown origin. Here we extend the theoretical results to predictive classifiers acknowledging feature dependencies either through graphical models or sparser alternatives defined as stratified graphical models. We also show through experimentation with both synthetic and real data that the predictive classifiers based on stratified graphical models have consistently best accuracy compared with the predictive classifiers based on either conditionally independent features or on ordinary graphical models."}
{"text": "  Recently, we have proposed a maximum likelihood iterative algorithm for estimation of the parameters of the Nakagami-m distribution. This technique performs better than state of art estimation techniques for this distribution. This could be of particular use in low data or block based estimation problems. In these scenarios, the estimator should be able to give accurate estimates in the mean square sense with less amounts of data. Also, the estimates should improve with the increase in number of blocks received. In this paper, we see through our simulations, that our proposal is well designed for such requirements. Further, it is well known in the literature that an efficient estimator does not exist for Nakagami-m distribution. In this paper, we derive a theoretical expression for the variance of our proposed estimator. We find that this expression clearly fits the experimental curve for the variance of the proposed estimator. This expression is pretty close to the cramer-rao lower bound(CRLB)."}
{"text": "  Many feature subset selection (FSS) algorithms have been proposed, but not all of them are appropriate for a given feature selection problem. At the same time, so far there is rarely a good way to choose appropriate FSS algorithms for the problem at hand. Thus, FSS algorithm automatic recommendation is very important and practically useful. In this paper, a meta learning based FSS algorithm automatic recommendation method is presented. The proposed method first identifies the data sets that are most similar to the one at hand by the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm, and the distances among these data sets are calculated based on the commonly-used data set characteristics. Then, it ranks all the candidate FSS algorithms according to their performance on these similar data sets, and chooses the algorithms with best performance as the appropriate ones. The performance of the candidate FSS algorithms is evaluated by a multi-criteria metric that takes into account not only the classification accuracy over the selected features, but also the runtime of feature selection and the number of selected features. The proposed recommendation method is extensively tested on 115 real world data sets with 22 well-known and frequently-used different FSS algorithms for five representative classifiers. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed FSS algorithm recommendation method."}
{"text": "  In data analysis, latent variables play a central role because they help provide powerful insights into a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from biological to human sciences. The latent tree model, a particular type of probabilistic graphical models, deserves attention. Its simple structure - a tree - allows simple and efficient inference, while its latent variables capture complex relationships. In the past decade, the latent tree model has been subject to significant theoretical and methodological developments. In this review, we propose a comprehensive study of this model. First we summarize key ideas underlying the model. Second we explain how it can be efficiently learned from data. Third we illustrate its use within three types of applications: latent structure discovery, multidimensional clustering, and probabilistic inference. Finally, we conclude and give promising directions for future researches in this field."}
{"text": "  In this tutorial we explain the inference procedures developed for the sparse Gaussian process (GP) regression and Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM). Due to page limit the derivation given in Titsias (2009) and Titsias & Lawrence (2010) is brief, hence getting a full picture of it requires collecting results from several different sources and a substantial amount of algebra to fill-in the gaps. Our main goal is thus to collect all the results and full derivations into one place to help speed up understanding this work. In doing so we present a re-parametrisation of the inference that allows it to be carried out in parallel. A secondary goal for this document is, therefore, to accompany our paper and open-source implementation of the parallel inference scheme for the models. We hope that this document will bridge the gap between the equations as implemented in code and those published in the original papers, in order to make it easier to extend existing work. We assume prior knowledge of Gaussian processes and variational inference, but we also include references for further reading where appropriate."}
{"text": "  How should we present training examples to learners to teach them classification rules? This is a natural problem when training workers for crowdsourcing labeling tasks, and is also motivated by challenges in data-driven online education. We propose a natural stochastic model of the learners, modeling them as randomly switching among hypotheses based on observed feedback. We then develop STRICT, an efficient algorithm for selecting examples to teach to workers. Our solution greedily maximizes a submodular surrogate objective function in order to select examples to show to the learners. We prove that our strategy is competitive with the optimal teaching policy. Moreover, for the special case of linear separators, we prove that an exponential reduction in error probability can be achieved. Our experiments on simulated workers as well as three real image annotation tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk show the effectiveness of our teaching algorithm."}
{"text": "  Practical model building processes are often time-consuming because many different models must be trained and validated. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that can be used for computing the lower and the upper bounds of model validation errors without actually training the model itself. A key idea behind our algorithm is using a side information available from a suboptimal model. If a reasonably good suboptimal model is available, our algorithm can compute lower and upper bounds of many useful quantities for making inferences on the unknown target model. We demonstrate the advantage of our algorithm in the context of model selection for regularized learning problems."}
{"text": "  Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI) is a new approach to distinguish between cause and effect for two variables. It is based on an independence assumption between input distribution and causal mechanism that can be phrased in terms of orthogonality in information space. We describe two intuitive reinterpretations of this approach that makes IGCI more accessible to a broader audience.   Moreover, we show that the described independence is related to the hypothesis that unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning only works for predicting the cause from the effect and not vice versa."}
{"text": "  Deep generative models (DGMs) have brought about a major breakthrough, as well as renewed interest, in generative latent variable models. However, DGMs do not allow for performing data-driven inference of the number of latent features needed to represent the observed data. Traditional linear formulations address this issue by resorting to tools from the field of nonparametric statistics. Indeed, linear latent variable models imposed an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior have been extensively studied by the machine learning community; inference for such models can been performed either via exact sampling or via approximate variational techniques. Based on this inspiration, in this paper we examine whether similar ideas from the field of Bayesian nonparametrics can be utilized in the context of modern DGMs in order to address the latent variable dimensionality inference problem. To this end, we propose a novel DGM formulation, based on the imposition of an IBP prior. We devise an efficient Black-Box Variational inference algorithm for our model, and exhibit its efficacy in a number of semi-supervised classification experiments. In all cases, we use popular benchmark datasets, and compare to state-of-the-art DGMs."}
{"text": "  Let $f:\\{-1,1\\}^n$ be a polynomial with at most $s$ non-zero real coefficients. We give an algorithm for exactly reconstructing f given random examples from the uniform distribution on $\\{-1,1\\}^n$ that runs in time polynomial in $n$ and $2s$ and succeeds if the function satisfies the unique sign property: there is one output value which corresponds to a unique set of values of the participating parities. This sufficient condition is satisfied when every coefficient of f is perturbed by a small random noise, or satisfied with high probability when s parity functions are chosen randomly or when all the coefficients are positive. Learning sparse polynomials over the Boolean domain in time polynomial in $n$ and $2s$ is considered notoriously hard in the worst-case. Our result shows that the problem is tractable for almost all sparse polynomials. Then, we show an application of this result to hypergraph sketching which is the problem of learning a sparse (both in the number of hyperedges and the size of the hyperedges) hypergraph from uniformly drawn random cuts. We also provide experimental results on a real world dataset."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of dictionary learning under the assumption that the observed signals can be represented as sparse linear combinations of the columns of a single large dictionary matrix. In particular, we analyze the minimax risk of the dictionary learning problem which governs the mean squared error (MSE) performance of any learning scheme, regardless of its computational complexity. By following an established information-theoretic method based on Fanos inequality, we derive a lower bound on the minimax risk for a given dictionary learning problem. This lower bound yields a characterization of the sample-complexity, i.e., a lower bound on the required number of observations such that consistent dictionary learning schemes exist. Our bounds may be compared with the performance of a given learning scheme, allowing to characterize how far the method is from optimal performance."}
{"text": "  Recently there has been much work on selective sampling, an online active learning setting, in which algorithms work in rounds. On each round an algorithm receives an input and makes a prediction. Then, it can decide whether to query a label, and if so to update its model, otherwise the input is discarded. Most of this work is focused on the stationary case, where it is assumed that there is a fixed target model, and the performance of the algorithm is compared to a fixed model. However, in many real-world applications, such as spam prediction, the best target function may drift over time, or have shifts from time to time. We develop a novel selective sampling algorithm for the drifting setting, analyze it under no assumptions on the mechanism generating the sequence of instances, and derive new mistake bounds that depend on the amount of drift in the problem. Simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms as a selective sampling algorithm in the drifting setting."}
{"text": "  In the election of a hierarchical clustering method, theoretic properties may give some insight to determine which method is the most suitable to treat a clustering problem. Herein, we study some basic properties of two hierarchical clustering methods: $\\alpha$-unchaining single linkage or $SL(\\alpha)$ and a modified version of this one, $SL^*(\\alpha)$. We compare the results with the properties satisfied by the classical linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods."}
{"text": "  We present a new probabilistic model of compact commutative Lie groups that produces invariant-equivariant and disentangled representations of data. To define the notion of disentangling, we borrow a fundamental principle from physics that is used to derive the elementary particles of a system from its symmetries. Our model employs a newfound Bayesian conjugacy relation that enables fully tractable probabilistic inference over compact commutative Lie groups -- a class that includes the groups that describe the rotation and cyclic translation of images. We train the model on pairs of transformed image patches, and show that the learned invariant representation is highly effective for classification."}
{"text": "  A new non parametric approach to the problem of testing the independence of two random process is developed. The test statistic is the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which was used previously in testing independence for i.i.d pairs of variables. The asymptotic behaviour of HSIC is established when computed from samples drawn from random processes. It is shown that earlier bootstrap procedures which worked in the i.i.d. case will fail for random processes, and an alternative consistent estimate of the p-values is proposed. Tests on artificial data and real-world Forex data indicate that the new test procedure discovers dependence which is missed by linear approaches, while the earlier bootstrap procedure returns an elevated number of false positives. The code is available online: https://github.com/kacperChwialkowski/HSIC ."}
{"text": "  We propose a new high dimensional semiparametric principal component analysis (PCA) method, named Copula Component Analysis (COCA). The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspecified marginally monotone transformations, the distributions are multivariate Gaussian. COCA improves upon PCA and sparse PCA in three aspects: (i) It is robust to modeling assumptions; (ii) It is robust to outliers and data contamination; (iii) It is scale-invariant and yields more interpretable results. We prove that the COCA estimators obtain fast estimation rates and are feature selection consistent when the dimension is nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size. Careful experiments confirm that COCA outperforms sparse PCA on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "  Semisupervised learning is a learning standard which deals with the study of how computers and natural systems such as human beings acquire knowledge in the presence of both labeled and unlabeled data. Semisupervised learning based methods are preferred when compared to the supervised and unsupervised learning because of the improved performance shown by the semisupervised approaches in the presence of large volumes of data. Labels are very hard to attain while unlabeled data are surplus, therefore semisupervised learning is a noble indication to shrink human labor and improve accuracy. There has been a large spectrum of ideas on semisupervised learning. In this paper we bring out some of the key approaches for semisupervised learning."}
{"text": "  This paper adapts a recently developed regularized stochastic version of the Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method for the solution of support vector machine classification problems. The proposed method is shown to converge almost surely to the optimal classifier at a rate that is linear in expectation. Numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits a convergence rate that degrades smoothly with the dimensionality of the feature vectors."}
{"text": "  \"Deep Learning\" methods attempt to learn generic features in an unsupervised fashion from a large unlabelled data set. These generic features should perform as well as the best hand crafted features for any learning problem that makes use of this data. We provide a definition of generic features, characterize when it is possible to learn them and provide methods closely related to the autoencoder and deep belief network of deep learning. In order to do so we use the notion of deficiency and illustrate its value in studying certain general learning problems."}
{"text": "  To achieve acceptable performance for AI tasks, one can either use sophisticated feature extraction methods as the first layer in a two-layered supervised learning model, or learn the features directly using a deep (multi-layered) model. While the first approach is very problem-specific, the second approach has computational overheads in learning multiple layers and fine-tuning of the model. In this paper, we propose an approach called wide learning based on arc-cosine kernels, that learns a single layer of infinite width. We propose exact and inexact learning strategies for wide learning and show that wide learning with single layer outperforms single layer as well as deep architectures of finite width for some benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider a very general model for exploration-exploitation tradeoff which allows arbitrary concave rewards and convex constraints on the decisions across time, in addition to the customary limitation on the time horizon. This model subsumes the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) model, and the Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) model of Badanidiyuru et al.[2013]. We also consider an extension of this model to allow linear contexts, similar to the linear contextual extension of the MAB model. We demonstrate that a natural and simple extension of the UCB family of algorithms for MAB provides a polynomial time algorithm that has near-optimal regret guarantees for this substantially more general model, and matches the bounds provided by Badanidiyuru et al.[2013] for the special case of BwK, which is quite surprising. We also provide computationally more efficient algorithms by establishing interesting connections between this problem and other well studied problems/algorithms such as the Blackwell approachability problem, online convex optimization, and the Frank-Wolfe technique for convex optimization. We give examples of several concrete applications, where this more general model of bandits allows for richer and/or more efficient formulations of the problem."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we are concerned with obtaining distribution-free concentration inequalities for mixture of independent Bernoulli variables that incorporate a notion of variance. Missing mass is the total probability mass associated to the outcomes that have not been seen in a given sample which is an important quantity that connects density estimates obtained from a sample to the population for discrete distributions. Therefore, we are specifically motivated to apply our method to study the concentration of missing mass - which can be expressed as a mixture of Bernoulli - in a novel way.   We not only derive - for the first time - Bernstein-like large deviation bounds for the missing mass whose exponents behave almost linearly with respect to deviation size, but also sharpen McAllester and Ortiz (2003) and Berend and Kontorovich (2013) for large sample sizes in the case of small deviations which is the most interesting case in learning theory. In the meantime, our approach shows that the heterogeneity issue introduced in McAllester and Ortiz (2003) is resolvable in the case of missing mass in the sense that one can use standard inequalities but it may not lead to strong results. Thus, we postulate that our results are general and can be applied to provide potentially sharp Bernstein-like bounds under some constraints."}
{"text": "  The objective of the GreenPAD project is to use green energy (wind, solar and biomass) for powering data-centers that are used to run HPC jobs. As a part of this it is important to predict the Renewable (Wind) energy for efficient scheduling (executing jobs that require higher energy when there is more green energy available and vice-versa). For predicting the wind energy we first analyze the historical data to find a statistical model that gives relation between wind energy and weather attributes. Then we use this model based on the weather forecast data to predict the green energy availability in the future. Using the green energy prediction obtained from the statistical model we are able to precompute job schedules for maximizing the green energy utilization in the future. We propose a model which uses live weather data in addition to machine learning techniques (which can predict future deviations in weather conditions based on current deviations from the forecast) to make on-the-fly changes to the precomputed schedule (based on green energy prediction).   For this we first analyze the data using histograms and simple statistical tools such as correlation. In addition we build (correlation) regression model for finding the relation between wind energy availability and weather attributes (temperature, cloud cover, air pressure, wind speed / direction, precipitation and sunshine). We also analyze different algorithms and machine learning techniques for optimizing the job schedules for maximizing the green energy utilization."}

{"text": "  The goal of machine learning is to develop predictors that generalize well to test data. Ideally, this is achieved by training on an almost infinitely large training data set that captures all variations in the data distribution. In practical learning settings, however, we do not have infinite data and our predictors may overfit. Overfitting may be combatted, for example, by adding a regularizer to the training objective or by defining a prior over the model parameters and performing Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a third, alternative approach to combat overfitting: we extend the training set with infinitely many artificial training examples that are obtained by corrupting the original training data. We show that this approach is practical and efficient for a range of predictors and corruption models. Our approach, called marginalized corrupted features (MCF), trains robust predictors by minimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corruption model. We show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be trained efficiently, may generalize substantially better to test data, and are also more robust to feature deletion at test time."}
{"text": "  When dealing with datasets containing a billion instances or with simulations that require a supercomputer to execute, computational resources become part of the equation. We can improve the efficiency of learning and inference by exploiting their inherent statistical nature. We propose algorithms that exploit the redundancy of data relative to a model by subsampling data-cases for every update and reasoning about the uncertainty created in this process. In the context of learning we propose to test for the probability that a stochastically estimated gradient points more than 180 degrees in the wrong direction. In the context of MCMC sampling we use stochastic gradients to improve the efficiency of MCMC updates, and hypothesis tests based on adaptive mini-batches to decide whether to accept or reject a proposed parameter update. Finally, we argue that in the context of likelihood free MCMC one needs to store all the information revealed by all simulations, for instance in a Gaussian process. We conclude that Bayesian methods will remain to play a crucial role in the era of big data and big simulations, but only if we overcome a number of computational challenges."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new problem, the Online Selective Anomaly Detection (OSAD), to model a specific scenario emerging from research in sleep science. Scientists have segmented sleep into several stages and stage two is characterized by two patterns (or anomalies) in the EEG time series recorded on sleep subjects. These two patterns are sleep spindle (SS) and K-complex. The OSAD problem was introduced to design a residual system, where all anomalies (known and unknown) are detected but the system only triggers an alarm when non-SS anomalies appear. The solution of the OSAD problem required us to combine techniques from both machine learning and control theory. Experiments on data from real subjects attest to the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "  A commonly used paradigm for representing graphs is to use a vector that contains normalized frequencies of occurrence of certain motifs or sub-graphs. This vector representation can be used in a variety of applications, such as, for computing similarity between graphs. The graphlet kernel of Shervashidze et al. [32] uses induced sub-graphs of k nodes (christened as graphlets by Przulj [28]) as motifs in the vector representation, and computes the kernel via a dot product between these vectors. One can easily show that this is a valid kernel between graphs. However, such a vector representation suffers from a few drawbacks. As k becomes larger we encounter the sparsity problem; most higher order graphlets will not occur in a given graph. This leads to diagonal dominance, that is, a given graph is similar to itself but not to any other graph in the dataset. On the other hand, since lower order graphlets tend to be more numerous, using lower values of k does not provide enough discrimination ability. We propose a smoothing technique to tackle the above problems. Our method is based on a novel extension of Kneser-Ney and Pitman-Yor smoothing techniques from natural language processing to graphs. We use the relationships between lower order and higher order graphlets in order to derive our method. Consequently, our smoothing algorithm not only respects the dependency between sub-graphs but also tackles the diagonal dominance problem by distributing the probability mass across graphlets. In our experiments, the smoothed graphlet kernel outperforms graph kernels based on raw frequency counts."}
{"text": "  We study algorithms for online linear optimization in Hilbert spaces, focusing on the case where the player is unconstrained. We develop a novel characterization of a large class of minimax algorithms, recovering, and even improving, several previous results as immediate corollaries. Moreover, using our tools, we develop an algorithm that provides a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}\\Big(U \\sqrt{T \\log(U \\sqrt{T} \\log^2 T +1)}\\Big)$, where $U$ is the $L_2$ norm of an arbitrary comparator and both $T$ and $U$ are unknown to the player. This bound is optimal up to $\\sqrt{\\log \\log T}$ terms. When $T$ is known, we derive an algorithm with an optimal regret bound (up to constant factors). For both the known and unknown $T$ case, a Normal approximation to the conditional value of the game proves to be the key analysis tool."}
{"text": "  In this paper we present methods for exemplar based clustering with outlier selection based on the facility location formulation. Given a distance function and the number of outliers to be found, the methods automatically determine the number of clusters and outliers. We formulate the problem as an integer program to which we present relaxations that allow for solutions that scale to large data sets. The advantages of combining clustering and outlier selection include: (i) the resulting clusters tend to be compact and semantically coherent (ii) the clusters are more robust against data perturbations and (iii) the outliers are contextualised by the clusters and more interpretable, i.e. it is easier to distinguish between outliers which are the result of data errors from those that may be indicative of a new pattern emergent in the data. We present and contrast three relaxations to the integer program formulation: (i) a linear programming formulation (LP) (ii) an extension of affinity propagation to outlier detection (APOC) and (iii) a Lagrangian duality based formulation (LD). Evaluation on synthetic as well as real data shows the quality and scalability of these different methods."}
{"text": "  The $k$-support norm is a regularizer which has been successfully applied to sparse vector prediction problems. We show that it belongs to a general class of norms which can be formulated as a parameterized infimum over quadratics. We further extend the $k$-support norm to matrices, and we observe that it is a special case of the matrix cluster norm. Using this formulation we derive an efficient algorithm to compute the proximity operator of both norms. This improves upon the standard algorithm for the $k$-support norm and allows us to apply proximal gradient methods to the cluster norm. We also describe how to solve regularization problems which employ centered versions of these norms. Finally, we apply the matrix regularizers to different matrix completion and multitask learning datasets. Our results indicate that the spectral $k$-support norm and the cluster norm give state of the art performance on these problems, significantly outperforming trace norm and elastic net penalties."}
{"text": "  In the past few years co-clustering has emerged as an important data mining tool for two way data analysis. Co-clustering is more advantageous over traditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as, ability to find highly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of the overlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract meaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. For example, building predictive models with high dimensional data and heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such data, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more accurate predictive model building. Several applications such as finding patient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in recommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from co-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to generate co-clusters for improved data analysis.   In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping Co-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and improved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by maximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on the number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and f-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters. Results of our algorithm has been compared with two other well-known techniques - K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over four real data set namely, Leukemia, Internet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our algorithm POCC in practice."}
{"text": "  In recent years the importance of finding a meaningful pattern from huge datasets has become more challenging. Data miners try to adopt innovative methods to face this problem by applying feature selection methods. In this paper we propose a new hybrid method in which we use a combination of resampling, filtering the sample domain and wrapper subset evaluation method with genetic search to reduce dimensions of Lung-Cancer dataset that we received from UCI Repository of Machine Learning databases. Finally, we apply some well- known classification algorithms (Na\\\"ive Bayes, Logistic, Multilayer Perceptron, Best First Decision Tree and JRIP) to the resulting dataset and compare the results and prediction rates before and after the application of our feature selection method on that dataset. The results show a substantial progress in the average performance of five classification algorithms simultaneously and the classification error for these classifiers decreases considerably. The experiments also show that this method outperforms other feature selection methods with a lower cost."}
{"text": "  Cluster analysis has attracted more and more attention in the field of machine learning and data mining. Numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed and are being developed due to diverse theories and various requirements of emerging applications. Therefore, it is very worth establishing an unified axiomatic framework for data clustering. In the literature, it is an open problem and has been proved very challenging. In this paper, clustering results are axiomatized by assuming that an proper clustering result should satisfy categorization axioms. The proposed axioms not only introduce classification of clustering results and inequalities of clustering results, but also are consistent with prototype theory and exemplar theory of categorization models in cognitive science. Moreover, the proposed axioms lead to three principles of designing clustering algorithm and cluster validity index, which follow many popular clustering algorithms and cluster validity indices."}
{"text": "  In this paper a hybrid feature selection method is proposed which takes advantages of wrapper subset evaluation with a lower cost and improves the performance of a group of classifiers. The method uses combination of sample domain filtering and resampling to refine the sample domain and two feature subset evaluation methods to select reliable features.

The first phase filters and resamples the sample domain and the second phase adopts a hybrid procedure by information gain, wrapper subset evaluation and genetic search to find the optimal feature space. Experiments carried out on different types of datasets from UCI Repository of Machine Learning databases and the results show a rise in the average performance of five classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic, Multilayer Perceptron, Best First Decision Tree and JRIP) simultaneously and the classification error for these classifiers decreases considerably.

The SEER public use cancer database provides various prominent class labels for prognosis prediction. The main objective of this paper is to find the effect of sampling techniques in classifying the prognosis variable and propose an ideal sampling method based on the outcome of the experimentation. In the first phase of this work the traditional random sampling and stratified sampling techniques have been used. At the next level the balanced stratified sampling with variations as per the choice of the prognosis class labels have been tested. Much of the initial time has been focused on performing the pre_processing of the SEER data set. The classification model for experimentation has been built using the breast cancer, respiratory cancer and mixed cancer data sets with three traditional classifiers namely Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The three prognosis factors survival, stage and metastasis have been used as class labels for experimental comparisons. The results shows a steady increase in the prediction accuracy of balanced stratified model as the sample size increases, but the traditional approach fluctuates before the optimum results."}
{"text": "  We present tools for the analysis of Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), Dual Averaging, and Mirror Descent algorithms when the regularizer (equivalently, prox-function or learning rate schedule) is chosen adaptively based on the data. Adaptivity can be used to prove regret bounds that hold on every round, and also allows for data-dependent regret bounds as in AdaGrad-style algorithms (e.g., Online Gradient Descent with adaptive per-coordinate learning rates). We present results from a large number of prior works in a unified manner, using a modular and tight analysis that isolates the key arguments in easily re-usable lemmas. This approach strengthens pre-viously known FTRL analysis techniques to produce bounds as tight as those achieved by potential functions or primal-dual analysis. Further, we prove a general and exact equivalence between an arbitrary adaptive Mirror Descent algorithm and a correspond- ing FTRL update, which allows us to analyze any Mirror Descent algorithm in the same framework. The key to bridging the gap between Dual Averaging and Mirror Descent algorithms lies in an analysis of the FTRL-Proximal algorithm family. Our regret bounds are proved in the most general form, holding for arbitrary norms and non-smooth regularizers with time-varying weight."}
{"text": "  In many applications, the training data, from which one needs to learn a classifier, is corrupted with label noise. Many standard algorithms such as SVM perform poorly in presence of label noise. In this paper we investigate the robustness of risk minimization to label noise. We prove a sufficient condition on a loss function for the risk minimization under that loss to be tolerant to uniform label noise. We show that the $0-1$ loss, sigmoid loss, ramp loss and probit loss satisfy this condition though none of the standard convex loss functions satisfy it. We also prove that, by choosing a sufficiently large value of a parameter in the loss function, the sigmoid loss, ramp loss and probit loss can be made tolerant to non-uniform label noise also if we can assume the classes to be separable under noise-free data distribution. Through extensive empirical studies, we show that risk minimization under the $0-1$ loss, the sigmoid loss and the ramp loss has much better robustness to label noise when compared to the SVM algorithm."}
{"text": "  This work investigates the use of mixed-norm regularization for sensor selection in Event-Related Potential (ERP) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The classification problem is cast as a discriminative optimization framework where sensor selection is induced through the use of mixed-norms. This framework is extended to the multi-task learning situation where several similar classification tasks related to different subjects are learned simultaneously. In this case, multi-task learning helps in leveraging data scarcity issue yielding to more robust classifiers. For this purpose, we have introduced a regularizer that induces both sensor selection and classifier similarities. The different regularization approaches are compared on three ERP datasets showing the interest of mixed-norm regularization in terms of sensor selection. The multi-task approaches are evaluated when a small number of learning examples are available yielding to significant performance improvements especially for subjects performing poorly."}
{"text": "  We present a nonparametric prior over reversible Markov chains. We use completely random measures, specifically gamma processes, to construct a countably infinite graph with weighted edges. By enforcing symmetry to make the edges undirected we define a prior over random walks on graphs that results in a reversible Markov chain. The resulting prior over infinite transition matrices is closely related to the hierarchical Dirichlet process but enforces reversibility. A reinforcement scheme has recently been proposed with similar properties, but the de Finetti measure is not well characterised. We take the alternative approach of explicitly constructing the mixing measure, which allows more straightforward and efficient inference at the cost of no longer having a closed form predictive distribution. We use our process to construct a reversible infinite HMM which we apply to two real datasets, one from epigenomics and one ion channel recording."}
{"text": "  This work considers the problem of estimating the parameters of negative mixture models, i.e. mixture models that possibly involve negative weights. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (i) We show that every rational probability distributions on strings, a representation which occurs naturally in spectral learning, can be computed by a negative mixture of at most two probabilistic automata (or HMMs). (ii) We propose a method to estimate the parameters of negative mixture models having a specific tensor structure in their low order observable moments. Building upon a recent paper on tensor decompositions for learning latent variable models, we extend this work to the broader setting of tensors having a symmetric decomposition with positive and negative weights. We introduce a generalization of the tensor power method for complex valued tensors, and establish theoretical convergence guarantees. (iii) We show how our approach applies to negative Gaussian mixture models, for which we provide some experiments."}
{"text": "  Motivated by multi-distribution divergences, which originate in information theory, we propose a notion of `multi-point' kernels, and study their applications. We study a class of kernels based on Jensen type divergences and show that these can be extended to measure similarity among multiple points. We study tensor flattening methods and develop a multi-point (kernel) spectral clustering (MSC) method. We further emphasize on a special case of the proposed kernels, which is a multi-point extension of the linear (dot-product) kernel and show the existence of cubic time tensor flattening algorithm in this case. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our contributions using standard data sets and image segmentation tasks."}
{"text": "  The Lasso is a computationally efficient regression regularization procedure that can produce sparse estimators when the number of predictors (p) is large. Oracle inequalities provide probability loss bounds for the Lasso estimator at a deterministic choice of the regularization parameter. These bounds tend to zero if p is appropriately controlled, and are thus commonly cited as theoretical justification for the Lasso and its ability to handle high-dimensional settings. Unfortunately, in practice the regularization parameter is not selected to be a deterministic quantity, but is instead chosen using a random, data-dependent procedure. To address this shortcoming of previous theoretical work, we study the loss of the Lasso estimator when tuned optimally for prediction. Assuming orthonormal predictors and a sparse true model, we prove that the probability that the best possible predictive performance of the Lasso deteriorates as p increases is positive and can be arbitrarily close to one given a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio and sufficiently large p. We further demonstrate empirically that the amount of deterioration in performance can be far worse than the oracle inequalities suggest and provide a real data example where deterioration is observed."}
{"text": "  In the synthesis model signals are represented as a sparse combinations of atoms from a dictionary. Dictionary learning describes the acquisition process of the underlying dictionary for a given set of training samples. While ideally this would be achieved by optimizing the expectation of the factors over the underlying distribution of the training data, in practice the necessary information about the distribution is not available. Therefore, in real world applications it is achieved by minimizing an empirical average over the available samples. The main goal of this paper is to provide a sample complexity estimate that controls to what extent the empirical average deviates from the cost function. This estimate then provides a suitable estimate to the accuracy of the representation of the learned dictionary. The presented approach exemplifies the general results proposed by the authors in Sample Complexity of Dictionary Learning and other Matrix Factorizations, Gribonval et al. and gives more concrete bounds of the sample complexity of dictionary learning. We cover a variety of sparsity measures employed in the learning procedure."}
{"text": "  We tackle the problem of learning linear classifiers from noisy datasets in a multiclass setting. The two-class version of this problem was studied a few years ago by, e.g. Bylander (1994) and Blum et al. (1996): in these contributions, the proposed approaches to fight the noise revolve around a Perceptron learning scheme fed with peculiar examples computed through a weighted average of points from the noisy training set. We propose to build upon these approaches and we introduce a new algorithm called UMA (for Unconfused Multiclass additive Algorithm) which may be seen as a generalization to the multiclass setting of the previous approaches. In order to characterize the noise we use the confusion matrix as a multiclass extension of the classification noise studied in the aforementioned literature. Theoretically well-founded, UMA furthermore displays very good empirical noise robustness, as evidenced by numerical simulations conducted on both synthetic and real data.

{"text": "  We present a supervised-learning algorithm from graph data (a set of graphs) for arbitrary twice-differentiable loss functions and sparse linear models over all possible subgraph features. To date, it has been shown that under all possible subgraph features, several types of sparse learning, such as Adaboost, LPBoost, LARS/LASSO, and sparse PLS regression, can be performed. Particularly emphasis is placed on simultaneous learning of relevant features from an infinite set of candidates. We first generalize techniques used in all these preceding studies to derive an unifying bounding technique for arbitrary separable functions. We then carefully use this bounding to make block coordinate gradient descent feasible over infinite subgraph features, resulting in a fast converging algorithm that can solve a wider class of sparse learning problems over graph data. We also empirically study the differences from the existing approaches in convergence property, selected subgraph features, and search-space sizes. We further discuss several unnoticed issues in sparse learning over all possible subgraph features."}
{"text": "  In many online learning problems we are interested in predicting local information about some universe of items. For example, we may want to know whether two items are in the same cluster rather than computing an assignment of items to clusters; we may want to know which of two teams will win a game rather than computing a ranking of teams. Although finding the optimal clustering or ranking is typically intractable, it may be possible to predict the relationships between items as well as if you could solve the global optimization problem exactly.   Formally, we consider an online learning problem in which a learner repeatedly guesses a pair of labels (l(x), l(y)) and receives an adversarial payoff depending on those labels. The learner's goal is to receive a payoff nearly as good as the best fixed labeling of the items. We show that a simple algorithm based on semidefinite programming can obtain asymptotically optimal regret in the case where the number of possible labels is O(1), resolving an open problem posed by Hazan, Kale, and Shalev-Schwartz. Our main technical contribution is a novel use and analysis of the log determinant regularizer, exploiting the observation that log det(A + I) upper bounds the entropy of any distribution with covariance matrix A."}
{"text": "  We provide an information-theoretic analysis of Thompson sampling that applies across a broad range of online optimization problems in which a decision-maker must learn from partial feedback. This analysis inherits the simplicity and elegance of information theory and leads to regret bounds that scale with the entropy of the optimal-action distribution. This strengthens preexisting results and yields new insight into how information improves performance."}
{"text": "  We propose information-directed sampling -- a new approach to online optimization problems in which a decision-maker must balance between exploration and exploitation while learning from partial feedback. Each action is sampled in a manner that minimizes the ratio between squared expected single-period regret and a measure of information gain: the mutual information between the optimal action and the next observation. We establish an expected regret bound for information-directed sampling that applies across a very general class of models and scales with the entropy of the optimal action distribution. We illustrate through simple analytic examples how information-directed sampling accounts for kinds of information that alternative approaches do not adequately address and that this can lead to dramatic performance gains. For the widely studied Bernoulli, Gaussian, and linear bandit problems, we demonstrate state-of-the-art simulation performance."}
{"text": "  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be identifiable under the separability assumption, under which all the columns(or rows) of the input data matrix belong to the convex cone generated by only a few of these columns(or rows) [1]. In real applications, however, such separability assumption is hard to satisfy. Following [4] and [5], in this paper, we look at the Linear Programming (LP) based reformulation to locate the extreme rays of the convex cone but in a noisy setting. Furthermore, in order to deal with the large scale data, we employ First-Order Methods (FOM) to mitigate the computational complexity of LP, which primarily results from a large number of constraints. We show the performance of the algorithm on real and synthetic data sets."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider low rank matrix estimation using either matrix-version Dantzig Selector $\\hat{A}_{\\lambda}^d$ or matrix-version LASSO estimator $\\hat{A}_{\\lambda}^L$. We consider sub-Gaussian measurements, $i.e.$, the measurements $X_1,\\ldots,X_n\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}$ have $i.i.d.$ sub-Gaussian entries. Suppose $\\textrm{rank}(A_0)=r$. We proved that, when $n\\geq Cm[r^2\\vee r\\log(m)\\log(n)]$ for some $C>0$, both $\\hat{A}_{\\lambda}^d$ and $\\hat{A}_{\\lambda}^L$ can obtain optimal upper bounds(except some logarithmic terms) for estimation accuracy under spectral norm. By applying metric entropy of Grassmann manifolds, we construct (near) matching minimax lower bound for estimation accuracy under spectral norm. We also give upper bounds and matching minimax lower bound(except some logarithmic terms) for estimation accuracy under Schatten-q norm for every $1\\leq q\\leq\\infty$. As a direct corollary, we show both upper bounds and minimax lower bounds of estimation accuracy under Ky-Fan-k norms for every $1\\leq k\\leq m$."}
{"text": "  This paper revisits the problem of learning a k-CNF Boolean function from examples in the context of online learning under the logarithmic loss. In doing so, we give a Bayesian interpretation to one of Valiant's celebrated PAC learning algorithms, which we then build upon to derive two efficient, online, probabilistic, supervised learning algorithms for predicting the output of an unknown k-CNF Boolean function. We analyze the loss of our methods, and show that the cumulative log-loss can be upper bounded, ignoring logarithmic factors, by a polynomial function of the size of each example."}
{"text": "  This work investigates into cost behaviors of binary classification measures in a background of class-imbalanced problems. Twelve performance measures are studied, such as F measure, G-means in terms of accuracy rates, and of recall and precision, balance error rate (BER), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), Kappa coefficient, etc. A new perspective is presented for those measures by revealing their cost functions with respect to the class imbalance ratio. Basically, they are described by four types of cost functions. The functions provides a theoretical understanding why some measures are suitable for dealing with class-imbalanced problems. Based on their cost functions, we are able to conclude that G-means of accuracy rates and BER are suitable measures because they show \"proper\" cost behaviors in terms of \"a misclassification from a small class will cause a greater cost than that from a large class\". On the contrary, F1 measure, G-means of recall and precision, MCC and Kappa coefficient measures do not produce such behaviors so that they are unsuitable to serve our goal in dealing with the problems properly."}
{"text": "  The motivation of this work is to improve the performance of standard stacking approaches or ensembles, which are composed of simple, heterogeneous base models, through the integration of the generation and selection stages for regression problems. We propose two extensions to the standard stacking approach. In the first extension we combine a set of standard stacking approaches into an ensemble of ensembles using a two-step ensemble learning in the regression setting. The second extension consists of two parts. In the initial part a diversity mechanism is injected into the original training data set, systematically generating different training subsets or partitions, and corresponding ensembles of ensembles. In the final part after measuring the quality of the different partitions or ensembles, a max-min rule-based selection algorithm is used to select the most appropriate ensemble/partition on which to make the final prediction. We show, based on experiments over a broad range of data sets, that the second extension performs better than the best of the standard stacking approaches, and is as good as the oracle of databases, which has the best base model selected by cross-validation for each data set. In addition to that, the second extension performs better than two state-of-the-art ensemble methods for regression, and it is as good as a third state-of-the-art ensemble method."}
{"text": "  We connect shift-invariant characteristic kernels to infinitely divisible distributions on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Characteristic kernels play an important role in machine learning applications with their kernel means to distinguish any two probability measures. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we show, using the L\\'evy-Khintchine formula, that any shift-invariant kernel given by a bounded, continuous and symmetric probability density function (pdf) of an infinitely divisible distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is characteristic. We also present some closure property of such characteristic kernels under addition, pointwise product, and convolution. Second, in developing various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to compute the following values: (i) kernel mean values $m_P(x)$, $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, and (ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products ${\\left\\langle m_P, m_Q \\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}}$, for probability measures $P, Q$. If $P, Q$, and kernel $k$ are Gaussians, then computation (i) and (ii) results in Gaussian pdfs that is tractable. We generalize this Gaussian combination to more general cases in the class of infinitely divisible distributions. We then introduce a {\\it conjugate} kernel and {\\it convolution trick}, so that the above (i) and (ii) have the same pdf form, expecting tractable computation at least in some cases. As specific instances, we explore $\\alpha$-stable distributions and a rich class of generalized hyperbolic distributions, where the Laplace, Cauchy and Student-t distributions are included."}
{"text": "  This paper presents an approximate method for performing Bayesian inference in models with conditional independence over a decentralized network of learning agents. The method first employs variational inference on each individual learning agent to generate a local approximate posterior, the agents transmit their local posteriors to other agents in the network, and finally each agent combines its set of received local posteriors. The key insight in this work is that, for many Bayesian models, approximate inference schemes destroy symmetry and dependencies in the model that are crucial to the correct application of Bayes' rule when combining the local posteriors. The proposed method addresses this issue by including an additional optimization step in the combination procedure that accounts for these broken dependencies. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the decentralized method provides advantages in computational performance and predictive test likelihood over previous batch and distributed methods."}
{"text": "  Many kernel methods suffer from high time and space complexities and are thus prohibitive in big-data applications. To tackle the computational challenge, the Nystr\\\"om method has been extensively used to reduce time and space complexities by sacrificing some accuracy. The Nystr\\\"om method speedups computation by constructing an approximation of the kernel matrix using only a few columns of the matrix. Recently, a variant of the Nystr\\\"om method called the modified Nystr\\\"om method has demonstrated significant improvement over the standard Nystr\\\"om method in approximation accuracy, both theoretically and empirically.   In this paper, we propose two algorithms that make the modified Nystr\\\"om method practical. First, we devise a simple column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Our algorithm is more efficient and easier to implement than and nearly as accurate as the state-of-the-art algorithm. Second, with the selected columns at hand, we propose an algorithm that computes the approximation in lower time complexity than the approach in the previous work. Furthermore, we prove that the modified Nystr\\\"om method is exact under certain conditions, and we establish a lower error bound for the modified Nystr\\\"om method."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present a computational technique to deal with uncertainty in dynamic continuous models in Social Sciences. Considering data from surveys, the method consists of determining the probability distribution of the survey output and this allows to sample data and fit the model to the sampled data using a goodness-of-fit criterion based on the chi-square-test. Taking the fitted parameters non-rejected by the chi-square-test, substituting them into the model and computing their outputs, we build 95% confidence intervals in each time instant capturing uncertainty of the survey data (probabilistic estimation). Using the same set of obtained model parameters, we also provide a prediction over the next few years with 95% confidence intervals (probabilistic prediction). This technique is applied to a dynamic social model describing the evolution of the attitude of the Basque Country population towards the revolutionary organization ETA."}
{"text": "  Bayesian networks are convenient graphical expressions for high dimensional probability distributions representing complex relationships between a large number of random variables. They have been employed extensively in areas such as bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, diagnosis, and risk management. The recovery of the structure of a network from data is of prime importance for the purposes of modeling, analysis, and prediction. Most recovery algorithms in the literature assume either discrete of continuous but Gaussian data. For general continuous data, discretization is usually employed but often destroys the very structure one is out to recover. Friedman and Goldszmidt suggest an approach based on the minimum description length principle that chooses a discretization which preserves the information in the original data set, however it is one which is difficult, if not impossible, to implement for even moderately sized networks. In this paper we provide an extremely efficient search strategy which allows one to use the Friedman and Goldszmidt discretization in practice."}
{"text": "  The true process that generated data cannot be determined when multiple explanations are possible. Prediction requires a model of the probability that a process, chosen randomly from the set of candidate explanations, generates some future observation. The best model includes all of the information contained in the minimal description of the data that is not contained in the data. It is closely related to the Halting Problem and is logarithmic in the size of the data. Prediction is difficult because the ideal model is not computable, and the best computable model is not \"findable.\" However, the error from any approximation can be bounded by the size of the description using the model."}
{"text": "  The Bayesian Classification represents a supervised learning method as well as a statistical method for classification. Assumes an underlying probabilistic model and it allows us to capture uncertainty about the model in a principled way by determining probabilities of the outcomes. This Classification is named after Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), who proposed the Bayes Theorem. Bayesian classification provides practical learning algorithms and prior knowledge and observed data can be combined. Bayesian Classification provides a useful perspective for understanding and evaluating many learning algorithms. It calculates explicit probabilities for hypothesis and it is robust to noise in input data. In statistical classification the Bayes classifier minimises the probability of misclassification. That was a visual intuition for a simple case of the Bayes classifier, also called: 1)Idiot Bayes 2)Naive Bayes 3)Simple Bayes"}
{"text": "  In this paper, we evaluate the performance of various parallel optimization methods for Kernel Support Vector Machines on multicore CPUs and GPUs. In particular, we provide the first comparison of algorithms with explicit and implicit parallelization. Most existing parallel implementations for multi-core or GPU architectures are based on explicit parallelization of Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)---the programmers identified parallelizable components and hand-parallelized them, specifically tuned for a particular architecture. We compare these approaches with each other and with implicitly parallelized algorithms---where the algorithm is expressed such that most of the work is done within few iterations with large dense linear algebra operations. These can be computed with highly-optimized libraries, that are carefully parallelized for a large variety of parallel platforms. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and compare them on various benchmark data sets. We find an approximate implicitly parallel algorithm which is surprisingly efficient, permits a much simpler implementation, and leads to unprecedented speedups in SVM training."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the problem of estimating the structure of multiple related directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. Building on recent developments in exact estimation of DAGs using integer linear programming (ILP), we present an ILP approach for joint estimation over multiple DAGs, that does not require that the vertices in each DAG share a common ordering. Furthermore, we allow also for (potentially unknown) dependency structure between the DAGs. Results are presented on both simulated data and fMRI data obtained from multiple subjects."}
{"text": "  We present the \\textit{hierarchical Dirichlet scaling process} (HDSP), a Bayesian nonparametric mixed membership model. The HDSP generalizes the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to model the correlation structure between metadata in the corpus and mixture components. We construct the HDSP based on the normalized gamma representation of the Dirichlet process, and this construction allows incorporating a scaling function that controls the membership probabilities of the mixture components. We develop two scaling methods to demonstrate that different modeling assumptions can be expressed in the HDSP. We also derive the corresponding approximate posterior inference algorithms using variational Bayes. Through experiments on datasets of newswire, medical journal articles, conference proceedings, and product reviews, we show that the HDSP results in a better predictive performance than labeled LDA, partially labeled LDA, and author topic model and a better negative review classification performance than the supervised topic model and SVM."}
{"text": "  We propose a method for inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a high-dimensional Gaussian vector time series (discrete-time process) from a finite-length observation. By contrast to existing approaches, we do not rely on a parametric process model (such as, e.g., an autoregressive model) for the observed random process. Instead, we only require certain smoothness properties (in the Fourier domain) of the process. The proposed inference scheme works even for sample sizes much smaller than the number of scalar process components if the true underlying CIG is sufficiently sparse. A theoretical performance analysis provides conditions which guarantee that the probability of the proposed inference method to deliver a wrong CIG is below a prescribed value. These conditions imply lower bounds on the sample size such that the new method is consistent asymptotically. Some numerical experiments validate our theoretical performance analysis and demonstrate superior performance of our scheme compared to an existing (parametric) approach in case of model mismatch."}
{"text": "  Given $iid$ observations from an unknown absolute continuous distribution defined on some domain $\\Omega$, we propose a nonparametric method to learn a piecewise constant function to approximate the underlying probability density function. Our density estimate is a piecewise constant function defined on a binary partition of $\\Omega$. The key ingredient of the algorithm is to use discrepancy, a concept originates from Quasi Monte Carlo analysis, to control the partition process. The resulting algorithm is simple, efficient, and has a provable convergence rate. We empirically demonstrate its efficiency as a density estimation method. We present its applications on a wide range of tasks, including finding good initializations for k-means."}
{"text": "  In this paper we have focused on an efficient feature selection method in classification of audio files. The main objective is feature selection and extraction. We have selected a set of features for further analysis, which represents the elements in feature vector. By extraction method we can compute a numerical representation that can be used to characterize the audio using the existing toolbox. In this study Gain Ratio (GR) is used as a feature selection measure. GR is used to select splitting attribute which will separate the tuples into different classes. The pulse clarity is considered as a subjective measure and it is used to calculate the gain of features of audio files. The splitting criterion is employed in the application to identify the class or the music genre of a specific audio file from testing database. Experimental results indicate that by using GR the application can produce a satisfactory result for music genre classification. After dimensionality reduction best three features have been selected out of various features of audio file and in this technique we will get more than 90% successful classification result."}
{"text": "  We address structured covariance estimation in elliptical distributions by assuming that the covariance is a priori known to belong to a given convex set, e.g., the set of Toeplitz or banded matrices. We consider the General Method of Moments (GMM) optimization applied to robust Tyler's scatter M-estimator subject to these convex constraints. Unfortunately, GMM turns out to be non-convex due to the objective. Instead, we propose a new COCA estimator - a convex relaxation which can be efficiently solved. We prove that the relaxation is tight in the unconstrained case for a finite number of samples, and in the constrained case asymptotically. We then illustrate the advantages of COCA in synthetic simulations with structured compound Gaussian distributions. In these examples, COCA outperforms competing methods such as Tyler's estimator and its projection onto the structure set."}
{"text": "  We describe a simple, efficient, permutation based procedure for selecting the penalty parameter in the LASSO. The procedure, which is intended for applications where variable selection is the primary focus, can be applied in a variety of structural settings, including generalized linear models. We briefly discuss connections between permutation selection and existing theory for the LASSO. In addition, we present a simulation study and an analysis of three real data sets in which permutation selection is compared with cross-validation (CV), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and a selection method based on recently developed testing procedures for the LASSO."}
{"text": "  Predicting an individual's risk of experiencing a future clinical outcome is a statistical task with important consequences for both practicing clinicians and public health experts. Modern observational databases such as electronic health records (EHRs) provide an alternative to the longitudinal cohort studies traditionally used to construct risk models, bringing with them both opportunities and challenges. Large sample sizes and detailed covariate histories enable the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques to uncover complex associations and interactions, but observational databases are often ``messy,'' with high levels of missing data and incomplete patient follow-up. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the well-known Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning approach for classification to time-to-event outcomes subject to censoring. We compare the predictive performance of our method to the Cox proportional hazards model which is commonly used for risk prediction in healthcare populations, and illustrate its application to prediction of cardiovascular risk using an EHR dataset from a large Midwest integrated healthcare system."}
{"text": "  Analysis of high dimensional noisy data is of essence across a variety of research fields. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant feature subset that can facilitate classification or pattern detection. Traditional (supervised) feature selection methods utilize label information to guide the identification of relevant feature subsets. In this paper, however, we consider the unsupervised feature selection problem. Without the label information, it is particularly difficult to identify a small set of relevant features due to the noisy nature of real-world data which corrupts the intrinsic structure of the data. Our Gradient-based Laplacian Feature Selection (GLFS) selects important features by minimizing the variance of the Laplacian regularized least squares regression model. With $\\ell_1$ relaxation, GLFS can find a sparse subset of features that is relevant to the Laplacian manifolds. Extensive experiments on simulated, three real-world object recognition and two computational biology datasets, have illustrated the power and superior performance of our approach over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods. Additionally, we show that GLFS selects a sparser set of more relevant features in a supervised setting outperforming the popular elastic net methodology."}
{"text": "  A traditional and intuitively appealing Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning (MT-MKL) method is to optimize the sum (thus, the average) of objective functions with (partially) shared kernel function, which allows information sharing amongst tasks. We point out that the obtained solution corresponds to a single point on the Pareto Front (PF) of a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem, which considers the concurrent optimization of all task objectives involved in the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problem. Motivated by this last observation and arguing that the former approach is heuristic, we propose a novel Support Vector Machine (SVM) MT-MKL framework, that considers an implicitly-defined set of conic combinations of task objectives. We show that solving our framework produces solutions along a path on the aforementioned PF and that it subsumes the optimization of the average of objective functions as a special case. Using algorithms we derived, we demonstrate through a series of experimental results that the framework is capable of achieving better classification performance, when compared to other similar MTL approaches."}
{"text": "  This work presents a sound probabilistic method for enforcing adherence of the marginal probabilities of a multi-label model to automatically discovered deterministic relationships among labels. In particular we focus on discovering two kinds of relationships among the labels. The first one concerns pairwise positive entailement: pairs of labels, where the presence of one implies the presence of the other in all instances of a dataset. The second concerns exclusion: sets of labels that do not coexist in the same instances of the dataset. These relationships are represented with a Bayesian network. Marginal probabilities are entered as soft evidence in the network and adjusted through probabilistic inference. Our approach offers robust improvements in mean average precision compared to the standard binary relavance approach across all 12 datasets involved in our experiments. The discovery process helps interesting implicit knowledge to emerge, which could be useful in itself."}

{"text": "  Consider a Machine Learning Service Provider (MLSP) designed to rapidly create highly accurate learners for a never-ending stream of new tasks. The challenge is to produce task-specific learners that can be trained from few labeled samples, even if tasks are not uniquely identified, and the number of tasks and input dimensionality are large. In this paper, we argue that the MLSP should exploit knowledge from previous tasks to build a good representation of the environment it is in, and more precisely, that useful representations for such a service are ones that minimize generalization error for a new hypothesis trained on a new task. We formalize this intuition with a novel method that minimizes an empirical proxy of the intra-task small-sample generalization error. We present several empirical results showing state-of-the art performance on single-task transfer, multitask learning, and the full lifelong learning problem."}
{"text": "  Stochastic variational inference makes it possible to approximate posterior distributions induced by large datasets quickly using stochastic optimization. The algorithm relies on the use of fully factorized variational distributions. However, this \"mean-field\" independence approximation limits the fidelity of the posterior approximation, and introduces local optima. We show how to relax the mean-field approximation to allow arbitrary dependencies between global parameters and local hidden variables, producing better parameter estimates by reducing bias, sensitivity to local optima, and sensitivity to hyperparameters."}
{"text": "  Dropout and other feature noising schemes have shown promising results in controlling over-fitting by artificially corrupting the training data. Though extensive theoretical and empirical studies have been performed for generalized linear models, little work has been done for support vector machines (SVMs), one of the most successful approaches for supervised learning. This paper presents dropout training for linear SVMs. To deal with the intractable expectation of the non-smooth hinge loss under corrupting distributions, we develop an iteratively re-weighted least square (IRLS) algorithm by exploring data augmentation techniques. Our algorithm iteratively minimizes the expectation of a re-weighted least square problem, where the re-weights have closed-form solutions. The similar ideas are applied to develop a new IRLS algorithm for the expected logistic loss under corrupting distributions. Our algorithms offer insights on the connection and difference between the hinge loss and logistic loss in dropout training. Empirical results on several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of dropout training on significantly boosting the classification accuracy of linear SVMs."}
{"text": "  Machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict agent behaviors in real-world dynamic systems, such as advertiser behaviors in sponsored search and worker behaviors in crowdsourcing. The behavior data in these systems are generated by live agents: once the systems change due to the adoption of the prediction models learnt from the behavior data, agents will observe and respond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. As a result, the behavior data will evolve and will not be identically and independently distributed, posing great challenges to the theoretical analysis on the machine learning algorithms for behavior prediction. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments (MCRE) to describe the behavior data, and perform generalization analysis of the machine learning algorithms on its basis. Since the one-step transition probability matrix of MCRE depends on both previous states and the random environment, conventional techniques for generalization analysis cannot be directly applied. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique that transforms the original MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov chain. The new Markov chain involves more variables but is more regular, and thus easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when time approaches infinity. Then we prove a generalization bound for the machine learning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain, which depends on both the Markovian parameters and the covering number of the function class compounded by the loss function for behavior prediction and the behavior prediction model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs the generalization analysis on data generated by complex processes in real-world dynamic systems."}
{"text": "  Mean shift clustering finds the modes of the data probability density by identifying the zero points of the density gradient. Since it does not require to fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular clustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of the mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation and then compute its gradient. However, since good density estimation does not necessarily imply accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect two-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to directly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density estimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus is computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point algorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean shift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance. We empirically show that the proposed clustering method works much better than the mean shift especially for high-dimensional data. Experimental results further indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing clustering methods."}
{"text": "  Multi-target regression is concerned with the simultaneous prediction of multiple continuous target variables based on the same set of input variables. It arises in several interesting industrial and environmental application domains, such as ecological modelling and energy forecasting. This paper presents an ensemble method for multi-target regression that constructs new target variables via random linear combinations of existing targets. We discuss the connection of our approach with multi-label classification algorithms, in particular RA$k$EL, which originally inspired this work, and a family of recent multi-label classification algorithms that involve output coding. Experimental results on 12 multi-target datasets show that it performs significantly better than a strong baseline that learns a single model for each target using gradient boosting and compares favourably to multi-objective random forest approach, which is a state-of-the-art approach. The experiments further show that our approach improves more when stronger unconditional dependencies exist among the targets."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a novel approach for approximate integration over the uncertainty of noise and signal variances in Gaussian process (GP) regression. Our efficient and straightforward approach can also be applied to integration over input dependent noise variance (heteroscedasticity) and input dependent signal variance (nonstationarity) by setting independent GP priors for the noise and signal variances. We use expectation propagation (EP) for inference and compare results to Markov chain Monte Carlo in two simulated data sets and three empirical examples. The results show that EP produces comparable results with less computational burden."}
{"text": "  Coactive learning is an online problem solving setting where the solutions provided by a solver are interactively improved by a domain expert, which in turn drives learning. In this paper we extend the study of coactive learning to problems where obtaining a globally optimal or near-optimal solution may be intractable or where an expert can only be expected to make small, local improvements to a candidate solution. The goal of learning in this new setting is to minimize the cost as measured by the expert effort over time. We first establish theoretical bounds on the average cost of the existing coactive Perceptron algorithm. In addition, we consider new online algorithms that use cost-sensitive and Passive-Aggressive (PA) updates, showing similar or improved theoretical bounds. We provide an empirical evaluation of the learners in various domains, which show that the Perceptron based algorithms are quite effective and that unlike the case for online classification, the PA algorithms do not yield significant performance gains."}
{"text": "  We focus on an interpolation method referred to Bayesian reconstruction in this paper. Whereas in standard interpolation methods missing data are interpolated deterministically, in Bayesian reconstruction, missing data are interpolated probabilistically using a Bayesian treatment. In this paper, we address the framework of Bayesian reconstruction and its application to the traffic data reconstruction problem in the field of traffic engineering. In the latter part of this paper, we describe the evaluation of the statistical performance of our Bayesian traffic reconstruction model using a statistical mechanical approach and clarify its statistical behavior."}
{"text": "  Multi-view learning leverages correlations between different sources of data to make predictions in one view based on observations in another view. A popular approach is to assume that, both, the correlations between the views and the view-specific covariances have a low-rank structure, leading to inter-battery factor analysis, a model closely related to canonical correlation analysis. We propose a convex relaxation of this model using structured norm regularization. Further, we extend the convex formulation to a robust version by adding an l1-penalized matrix to our estimator, similarly to convex robust PCA. We develop and compare scalable algorithms for several convex multi-view models. We show experimentally that the view-specific correlations are improving data imputation performances, as well as labeling accuracy in real-world multi-label prediction tasks."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present a learning method for sequence labeling tasks in which each example sequence has multiple label sequences. Our method learns multiple models, one model for each label sequence. Each model computes the joint probability of all label sequences given the example sequence. Although each model considers all label sequences, its primary focus is only one label sequence, and therefore, each model becomes a task-specific model, for the task belonging to that primary label. Such multiple models are learned {\\it simultaneously} by facilitating the learning transfer among models through {\\it explicit parameter sharing}. We experiment the proposed method on two applications and show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method."}
{"text": "  Using an optimization algorithm to solve a machine learning problem is one of mainstreams in the field of science. In this work, we demonstrate a comprehensive comparison of some state-of-the-art first-order optimization algorithms for convex optimization problems in machine learning. We concentrate on several smooth and non-smooth machine learning problems with a loss function plus a regularizer. The overall experimental results show the superiority of primal-dual algorithms in solving a machine learning problem from the perspectives of the ease to construct, running time and accuracy."}
{"text": "  A new method to represent and approximate rotation matrices is introduced. The method represents approximations of a rotation matrix $Q$ with linearithmic complexity, i.e. with $\\frac{1}{2}n\\lg(n)$ rotations over pairs of coordinates, arranged in an FFT-like fashion. The approximation is \"learned\" using gradient descent. It allows to represent symmetric matrices $H$ as $QDQ^T$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix. It can be used to approximate covariance matrix of Gaussian models in order to speed up inference, or to estimate and track the inverse Hessian of an objective function by relating changes in parameters to changes in gradient along the trajectory followed by the optimization procedure. Experiments were conducted to approximate synthetic matrices, covariance matrices of real data, and Hessian matrices of objective functions involved in machine learning problems."}
{"text": "  Graphical models are commonly used tools for modeling multivariate random variables. While there exist many convenient multivariate distributions such as Gaussian distribution for continuous data, mixed data with the presence of discrete variables or a combination of both continuous and discrete variables poses new challenges in statistical modeling. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric model named latent Gaussian copula model for binary and mixed data. The observed binary data are assumed to be obtained by dichotomizing a latent variable satisfying the Gaussian copula distribution or the nonparanormal distribution. The latent Gaussian model with the assumption that the latent variables are multivariate Gaussian is a special case of the proposed model. A novel rank-based approach is proposed for both latent graph estimation and latent principal component analysis. Theoretically, the proposed methods achieve the same rates of convergence for both precision matrix estimation and eigenvector estimation, as if the latent variables were observed. Under similar conditions, the consistency of graph structure recovery and feature selection for leading eigenvectors is established. The performance of the proposed methods is numerically assessed through simulation studies, and the usage of our methods is illustrated by a genetic dataset."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose to study four meteorological and seasonal time series coupled with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modeling. We chose to combine two transfer functions for the nodes of the hidden layer, and to use a temporal indicator (time index as input) in order to take into account the seasonal aspect of the studied time series. The results of the prediction concern two years of measurements and the learning step, eight independent years. We show that this methodology can improve the accuracy of meteorological data estimation compared to a classical MLP modelling with a homogenous transfer function."}
{"text": "  Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used statistical models for modeling sequential data. The parameter estimation for HMMs from time series data is an important learning problem. The predominant methods for parameter estimation are based on local search heuristics, most notably the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. These methods are prone to local optima and oftentimes suffer from high computational and sample complexity. Recent years saw the emergence of spectral methods for the parameter estimation of HMMs, based on a method of moments approach. Two spectral learning algorithms as proposed by Hsu, Kakade and Zhang 2012 (arXiv:0811.4413) and Anandkumar, Hsu and Kakade 2012 (arXiv:1203.0683) are assessed in this work. Using experiments with synthetic data, the algorithms are compared with each other. Furthermore, the spectral methods are compared to the Baum-Welch algorithm, a well-established method applying the EM algorithm to HMMs. The spectral algorithms are found to have a much more favorable computational and sample complexity. Even though the algorithms readily handle high dimensional observation spaces, instability issues are encountered in this regime. In view of learning from real-world experimental data, the representation of real-valued observations for the use in spectral methods is discussed, presenting possible methods to represent data for the use in the learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  We investigate how different learning restrictions reduce learning power and how the different restrictions relate to one another. We give a complete map for nine different restrictions both for the cases of complete information learning and set-driven learning. This completes the picture for these well-studied \\emph{delayable} learning restrictions. A further insight is gained by different characterizations of \\emph{conservative} learning in terms of variants of \\emph{cautious} learning.   Our analyses greatly benefit from general theorems we give, for example showing that learners with exclusively delayable restrictions can always be assumed total."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel non-parametric adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional data based on rank-SVM. Data points are first ranked based on scores derived from nearest neighbor graphs on n-point nominal data. We then train a rank-SVM using this ranked data. A test-point is declared as an anomaly at alpha-false alarm level if the predicted score is in the alpha-percentile. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal and adaptive in that for any false alarm rate alpha, its decision region converges to the alpha-percentile level set of the unknown underlying density. In addition we illustrate through a number of synthetic and real-data experiments both the statistical performance and computational efficiency of our anomaly detector."}
{"text": "  We study a novel spline-like basis, which we name the \"falling factorial basis\", bearing many similarities to the classic truncated power basis. The advantage of the falling factorial basis is that it enables rapid, linear-time computations in basis matrix multiplication and basis matrix inversion. The falling factorial functions are not actually splines, but are close enough to splines that they provably retain some of the favorable properties of the latter functions. We examine their application in two problems: trend filtering over arbitrary input points, and a higher-order variant of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study the problem of learning a monotone DNF with at most $s$ terms of size (number of variables in each term) at most $r$ ($s$ term $r$-MDNF) from membership queries. This problem is equivalent to the problem of learning a general hypergraph using hyperedge-detecting queries, a problem motivated by applications arising in chemical reactions and genome sequencing.   We first present new lower bounds for this problem and then present deterministic and randomized adaptive algorithms with query complexities that are almost optimal. All the algorithms we present in this paper run in time linear in the query complexity and the number of variables $n$. In addition, all of the algorithms we present in this paper are asymptotically tight for fixed $r$ and/or $s$."}
{"text": "  We present a new algorithm for domain adaptation improving upon a discrepancy minimization algorithm previously shown to outperform a number of algorithms for this task. Unlike many previous algorithms for domain adaptation, our algorithm does not consist of a fixed reweighting of the losses over the training sample. We show that our algorithm benefits from a solid theoretical foundation and more favorable learning bounds than discrepancy minimization. We present a detailed description of our algorithm and give several efficient solutions for solving its optimization problem. We also report the results of several experiments showing that it outperforms discrepancy minimization."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of proper learning a Boolean Halfspace with integer weights $\\{0,1,\\ldots,t\\}$ from membership queries only. The best known algorithm for this problem is an adaptive algorithm that asks $n^{O(t^5)}$ membership queries where the best lower bound for the number of membership queries is $n^t$ [Learning Threshold Functions with Small Weights Using Membership Queries. COLT 1999]   In this paper we close this gap and give an adaptive proper learning algorithm with two rounds that asks $n^{O(t)}$ membership queries. We also give a non-adaptive proper learning algorithm that asks $n^{O(t^3)}$ membership queries."}
{"text": "  When I first encountered PAC-Bayesian concentration inequalities they seemed to me to be rather disconnected from good old-fashioned results like Hoeffding's and Bernstein's inequalities. But, at least for one flavour of the PAC-Bayesian bounds, there is actually a very close relation, and the main innovation is a continuous version of the union bound, along with some ingenious applications. Here's the gist of what's going on, presented from a machine learning perspective."}
{"text": "  The fundamental theorem of statistical learning states that for binary classification problems, any Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) learning rule has close to optimal sample complexity. In this paper we seek for a generic optimal learner for multiclass prediction. We start by proving a surprising result: a generic optimal multiclass learner must be improper, namely, it must have the ability to output hypotheses which do not belong to the hypothesis class, even though it knows that all the labels are generated by some hypothesis from the class. In particular, no ERM learner is optimal. This brings back the fundmamental question of \"how to learn\"? We give a complete answer to this question by giving a new analysis of the one-inclusion multiclass learner of Rubinstein et al (2006) showing that its sample complexity is essentially optimal. Then, we turn to study the popular hypothesis class of generalized linear classifiers. We derive optimal learners that, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are computationally efficient. Furthermore, we show that the sample complexity of these learners is better than the sample complexity of the ERM rule, thus settling in negative an open question due to Collins (2005)."}
{"text": "  We prove the existence of a canonical form for semi-deterministic transducers with incomparable sets of output strings. Based on this, we develop an algorithm which learns semi-deterministic transducers given access to translation queries. We also prove that there is no learning algorithm for semi-deterministic transducers that uses only domain knowledge."}
{"text": "  We consider a reinforcement learning setting introduced in (Maillard et al., NIPS 2011) where the learner does not have explicit access to the states of the underlying Markov decision process (MDP). Instead, she has access to several models that map histories of past interactions to states. Here we improve over known regret bounds in this setting, and more importantly generalize to the case where the models given to the learner do not contain a true model resulting in an MDP representation but only approximations of it. We also give improved error bounds for state aggregation."}
{"text": "  We study the convex relaxation of clustering and hamming embedding, focusing on the asymmetric case (co-clustering and asymmetric hamming embedding), understanding their relationship to LSH as studied by (Charikar 2002) and to the max-norm ball, and the differences between their symmetric and asymmetric versions."}
{"text": "  Additive models play an important role in semiparametric statistics. This paper gives learning rates for regularized kernel based methods for additive models. These learning rates compare favourably in particular in high dimensions to recent results on optimal learning rates for purely nonparametric regularized kernel based quantile regression using the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, provided the assumption of an additive model is valid. Additionally, a concrete example is presented to show that a Gaussian function depending only on one variable lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by an additive Gaussian kernel, but does not belong to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by the multivariate Gaussian kernel of the same variance."}
{"text": "  We present algorithms for reducing the Dueling Bandits problem to the conventional (stochastic) Multi-Armed Bandits problem. The Dueling Bandits problem is an online model of learning with ordinal feedback of the form \"A is preferred to B\" (as opposed to cardinal feedback like \"A has value 2.5\"), giving it wide applicability in learning from implicit user feedback and revealed and stated preferences. In contrast to existing algorithms for the Dueling Bandits problem, our reductions -- named $\\Doubler$, $\\MultiSbm$ and $\\DoubleSbm$ -- provide a generic schema for translating the extensive body of known results about conventional Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms to the Dueling Bandits setting. For $\\Doubler$ and $\\MultiSbm$ we prove regret upper bounds in both finite and infinite settings, and conjecture about the performance of $\\DoubleSbm$ which empirically outperforms the other two as well as previous algorithms in our experiments. In addition, we provide the first almost optimal regret bound in terms of second order terms, such as the differences between the values of the arms."}
{"text": "  The logistic loss function is often advocated in machine learning and statistics as a smooth and strictly convex surrogate for the 0-1 loss. In this paper we investigate the question of whether these smoothness and convexity properties make the logistic loss preferable to other widely considered options such as the hinge loss. We show that in contrast to known asymptotic bounds, as long as the number of prediction/optimization iterations is sub exponential, the logistic loss provides no improvement over a generic non-smooth loss function such as the hinge loss. In particular we show that the convergence rate of stochastic logistic optimization is bounded from below by a polynomial in the diameter of the decision set and the number of prediction iterations, and provide a matching tight upper bound. This resolves the COLT open problem of McMahan and Streeter (2012)."}
{"text": "  We propose a new two stage algorithm LING for large scale regression problems. LING has the same risk as the well known Ridge Regression under the fixed design setting and can be computed much faster. Our experiments have shown that LING performs well in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared with other large scale regression algorithms like Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Principal Component Regression on both simulated and real datasets."}
{"text": "  Dyadic prediction methods operate on pairs of objects (dyads), aiming to infer labels for out-of-sample dyads. We consider the full and almost full cold start problem in dyadic prediction, a setting that occurs when both objects in an out-of-sample dyad have not been observed during training, or if one of them has been observed, but very few times. A popular approach for addressing this problem is to train a model that makes predictions based on a pairwise feature representation of the dyads, or, in case of kernel methods, based on a tensor product pairwise kernel. As an alternative to such a kernel approach, we introduce a novel two-step learning algorithm that borrows ideas from the fields of pairwise learning and spectral filtering. We show theoretically that the two-step method is very closely related to the tensor product kernel approach, and experimentally that it yields a slightly better predictive performance. Moreover, unlike existing tensor product kernel methods, the two-step method allows closed-form solutions for training and parameter selection via cross-validation estimates both in the full and almost full cold start settings, making the approach much more efficient and straightforward to implement."}
{"text": "  We study a new class of online learning problems where each of the online algorithm's actions is assigned an adversarial value, and the loss of the algorithm at each step is a known and deterministic function of the values assigned to its recent actions. This class includes problems where the algorithm's loss is the minimum over the recent adversarial values, the maximum over the recent values, or a linear combination of the recent values. We analyze the minimax regret of this class of problems when the algorithm receives bandit feedback, and prove that when the minimum or maximum functions are used, the minimax regret is $\\tilde \\Omega(T^{2/3})$ (so called hard online learning problems), and when a linear function is used, the minimax regret is $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{T})$ (so called easy learning problems). Previously, the only online learning problem that was known to be provably hard was the multi-armed bandit with switching costs."}
{"text": "  This paper concerns the distributed training of nonlinear kernel machines on Map-Reduce. We show that a re-formulation of Nystr\\\"om approximation based solution which is solved using gradient based techniques is well suited for this, especially when it is necessary to work with a large number of basis points. The main advantages of this approach are: avoidance of computing the pseudo-inverse of the kernel sub-matrix corresponding to the basis points; simplicity and efficiency of the distributed part of the computations; and, friendliness to stage-wise addition of basis points. We implement the method using an AllReduce tree on Hadoop and demonstrate its value on a few large benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  Distributed training of $l_1$ regularized classifiers has received great attention recently. Most existing methods approach this problem by taking steps obtained from approximating the objective by a quadratic approximation that is decoupled at the individual variable level. These methods are designed for multicore and MPI platforms where communication costs are low. They are inefficient on systems such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity machines where communication costs are substantial. In this paper we design a distributed algorithm for $l_1$ regularization that is much better suited for such systems than existing algorithms. A careful cost analysis is used to support these points and motivate our method. The main idea of our algorithm is to do block optimization of many variables on the actual objective function within each computing node; this increases the computational cost per step that is matched with the communication cost, and decreases the number of outer iterations, thus yielding a faster overall method. Distributed Gauss-Seidel and Gauss-Southwell greedy schemes are used for choosing variables to update in each step. We establish global convergence theory for our algorithm, including Q-linear rate of convergence. Experiments on two benchmark problems show our method to be much faster than existing methods."}
{"text": "  We consider stochastic multi-armed bandit problems where the expected reward is a Lipschitz function of the arm, and where the set of arms is either discrete or continuous. For discrete Lipschitz bandits, we derive asymptotic problem specific lower bounds for the regret satisfied by any algorithm, and propose OSLB and CKL-UCB, two algorithms that efficiently exploit the Lipschitz structure of the problem. In fact, we prove that OSLB is asymptotically optimal, as its asymptotic regret matches the lower bound. The regret analysis of our algorithms relies on a new concentration inequality for weighted sums of KL divergences between the empirical distributions of rewards and their true distributions. For continuous Lipschitz bandits, we propose to first discretize the action space, and then apply OSLB or CKL-UCB, algorithms that provably exploit the structure efficiently. This approach is shown, through numerical experiments, to significantly outperform existing algorithms that directly deal with the continuous set of arms. Finally the results and algorithms are extended to contextual bandits with similarities."}
{"text": "  We present a new optimization-theoretic approach to analyzing Follow-the-Leader style algorithms, particularly in the setting where perturbations are used as a tool for regularization. We show that adding a strongly convex penalty function to the decision rule and adding stochastic perturbations to data correspond to deterministic and stochastic smoothing operations, respectively. We establish an equivalence between \"Follow the Regularized Leader\" and \"Follow the Perturbed Leader\" up to the smoothness properties. This intuition leads to a new generic analysis framework that recovers and improves the previous known regret bounds of the class of algorithms commonly known as Follow the Perturbed Leader."}
{"text": "  Random Forest (RF) is a powerful ensemble method for classification and regression tasks. It consists of decision trees set. Although, a single tree is well interpretable for human, the ensemble of trees is a black-box model. The popular technique to look inside the RF model is to visualize a RF proximity matrix obtained on data samples with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) method. Herein, we present a novel method based on Self-Organising Maps (SOM) for revealing intrinsic relationships in data that lay inside the RF used for classification tasks. We propose an algorithm to learn the SOM with the proximity matrix obtained from the RF. The visualization of RF proximity matrix with MDS and SOM is compared. What is more, the SOM learned with the RF proximity matrix has better classification accuracy in comparison to SOM learned with Euclidean distance. Presented approach enables better understanding of the RF and additionally improves accuracy of the SOM."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we set forth a new vision of reinforcement learning developed by us over the past few years, one that yields mathematically rigorous solutions to longstanding important questions that have remained unresolved: (i) how to design reliable, convergent, and robust reinforcement learning algorithms (ii) how to guarantee that reinforcement learning satisfies pre-specified \"safety\" guarantees, and remains in a stable region of the parameter space (iii) how to design \"off-policy\" temporal difference learning algorithms in a reliable and stable manner, and finally (iv) how to integrate the study of reinforcement learning into the rich theory of stochastic optimization. In this paper, we provide detailed answers to all these questions using the powerful framework of proximal operators.   The key idea that emerges is the use of primal dual spaces connected through the use of a Legendre transform. This allows temporal difference updates to occur in dual spaces, allowing a variety of important technical advantages. The Legendre transform elegantly generalizes past algorithms for solving reinforcement learning problems, such as natural gradient methods, which we show relate closely to the previously unconnected framework of mirror descent methods. Equally importantly, proximal operator theory enables the systematic development of operator splitting methods that show how to safely and reliably decompose complex products of gradients that occur in recent variants of gradient-based temporal difference learning. This key technical innovation makes it possible to finally design \"true\" stochastic gradient methods for reinforcement learning. Finally, Legendre transforms enable a variety of other benefits, including modeling sparsity and domain geometry. Our work builds extensively on recent work on the convergence of saddle-point algorithms, and on the theory of monotone operators."}

{"text": "  K-means algorithm is a very popular clustering algorithm which is famous for its simplicity. Distance measure plays a very important rule on the performance of this algorithm. We have different distance measure techniques available. But choosing a proper technique for distance calculation is totally dependent on the type of the data that we are going to cluster. In this paper an experimental study is done in Matlab to cluster the iris and wine data sets with different distance measures and thereby observing the variation of the performances shown."}
{"text": "  A useful strategy to deal with complex classification scenarios is the \"divide and conquer\" approach. The mixture of experts (MOE) technique makes use of this strategy by joinly training a set of classifiers, or experts, that are specialized in different regions of the input space. A global model, or gate function, complements the experts by learning a function that weights their relevance in different parts of the input space. Local feature selection appears as an attractive alternative to improve the specialization of experts and gate function, particularly, for the case of high dimensional data. Our main intuition is that particular subsets of dimensions, or subspaces, are usually more appropriate to classify instances located in different regions of the input space. Accordingly, this work contributes with a regularized variant of MoE that incorporates an embedded process for local feature selection using $L1$ regularization, with a simultaneous expert selection. The experiments are still pending."}

{"text": "  Bayesian mixture models are widely applied for unsupervised learning and exploratory data analysis. Markov chain Monte Carlo based on Gibbs sampling and split-merge moves are widely used for inference in these models. However, both methods are restricted to limited types of transitions and suffer from torpid mixing and low accept rates even for problems of modest size. We propose a method that considers a broader range of transitions that are close to equilibrium by exploiting multiple chains in parallel and using the past states adaptively to inform the proposal distribution. The method significantly improves on Gibbs and split-merge sampling as quantified using convergence diagnostics and acceptance rates. Adaptive MCMC methods which use past states to inform the proposal distribution has given rise to many ingenious sampling schemes for continuous problems and the present work can be seen as an important first step in bringing these benefits to partition-based problems"}
{"text": "  The performance of prediction models is often based on \"abstract metrics\" that estimate the model's ability to limit residual errors between the observed and predicted values. However, meaningful evaluation and selection of prediction models for end-user domains requires holistic and application-sensitive performance measures. Inspired by energy consumption prediction models used in the emerging \"big data\" domain of Smart Power Grids, we propose a suite of performance measures to rationally compare models along the dimensions of scale independence, reliability, volatility and cost. We include both application independent and dependent measures, the latter parameterized to allow customization by domain experts to fit their scenario. While our measures are generalizable to other domains, we offer an empirical analysis using real energy use data for three Smart Grid applications: planning, customer education and demand response, which are relevant for energy sustainability. Our results underscore the value of the proposed measures to offer a deeper insight into models' behavior and their impact on real applications, which benefit both data mining researchers and practitioners."}
{"text": "  One of the most fundamental problems in causal inference is the estimation of a causal effect when variables are confounded. This is difficult in an observational study, because one has no direct evidence that all confounders have been adjusted for. We introduce a novel approach for estimating causal effects that exploits observational conditional independencies to suggest \"weak\" paths in a unknown causal graph. The widely used faithfulness condition of Spirtes et al. is relaxed to allow for varying degrees of \"path cancellations\" that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the existence of confounding causal paths. The outcome is a posterior distribution over bounds on the average causal effect via a linear programming approach and Bayesian inference. We claim this approach should be used in regular practice along with other default tools in observational studies."}
{"text": "  Numbers and numerical vectors account for a large portion of data. However, recently the amount of string data generated has increased dramatically. Consequently, classifying string data is a common problem in many fields. The most widely used approach to this problem is to convert strings into numerical vectors using string kernels and subsequently apply a support vector machine that works in a numerical vector space. However, this non-one-to-one conversion involves a loss of information and makes it impossible to evaluate, using probability theory, the generalization error of a learning machine, considering that the given data to train and test the machine are strings generated according to probability laws. In this study, we approach this classification problem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings. To evaluate the generalization error of such a classifier theoretically, probability theory for strings is required. Therefore, we first extend a limit theorem on the asymptotic behavior of a consensus sequence of strings, which is the counterpart of the mean of numerical vectors, as demonstrated in the probability theory on a metric space of strings developed by one of the authors and his colleague in a previous study [18]. Using the obtained result, we then demonstrate that our learning machine classifies strings in an asymptotically optimal manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of our machine in practical data analysis by applying it to predicting protein--protein interactions using amino acid sequences."}
{"text": "  Linear dimensionality reduction methods are a cornerstone of analyzing high dimensional data, due to their simple geometric interpretations and typically attractive computational properties. These methods capture many data features of interest, such as covariance, dynamical structure, correlation between data sets, input-output relationships, and margin between data classes. Methods have been developed with a variety of names and motivations in many fields, and perhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been highlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as optimization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component analysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlations analysis, maximum autocorrelation factors, slow feature analysis, sufficient dimensionality reduction, undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization framework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an orthogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis. More broadly, this survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology."}
{"text": "  Information divergence that measures the difference between two nonnegative matrices or tensors has found its use in a variety of machine learning problems. Examples are Nonnegative Matrix/Tensor Factorization, Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, topic models, and Bayesian network optimization. The success of such a learning task depends heavily on a suitable divergence. A large variety of divergences have been suggested and analyzed, but very few results are available for an objective choice of the optimal divergence for a given task. Here we present a framework that facilitates automatic selection of the best divergence among a given family, based on standard maximum likelihood estimation. We first propose an approximated Tweedie distribution for the beta-divergence family. Selecting the best beta then becomes a machine learning problem solved by maximum likelihood. Next, we reformulate alpha-divergence in terms of beta-divergence, which enables automatic selection of alpha by maximum likelihood with reuse of the learning principle for beta-divergence. Furthermore, we show the connections between gamma and beta-divergences as well as R\\'enyi and alpha-divergences, such that our automatic selection framework is extended to non-separable divergences. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can quite accurately select information divergence across different learning problems and various divergence families."}
{"text": "  For a density $f$ on ${\\mathbb R}^d$, a {\\it high-density cluster} is any connected component of $\\{x: f(x) \\geq \\lambda\\}$, for some $\\lambda > 0$. The set of all high-density clusters forms a hierarchy called the {\\it cluster tree} of $f$. We present two procedures for estimating the cluster tree given samples from $f$. The first is a robust variant of the single linkage algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The second is based on the $k$-nearest neighbor graph of the samples. We give finite-sample convergence rates for these algorithms which also imply consistency, and we derive lower bounds on the sample complexity of cluster tree estimation. Finally, we study a tree pruning procedure that guarantees, under milder conditions than usual, to remove clusters that are spurious while recovering those that are salient."}
{"text": "  In this paper we explore how machine learning techniques can be applied to the discovery of efficient mathematical identities. We introduce an attribute grammar framework for representing symbolic expressions. Given a set of grammar rules we build trees that combine different rules, looking for branches which yield compositions that are analytically equivalent to a target expression, but of lower computational complexity. However, as the size of the trees grows exponentially with the complexity of the target expression, brute force search is impractical for all but the simplest of expressions. Consequently, we introduce two novel learning approaches that are able to learn from simpler expressions to guide the tree search. The first of these is a simple n-gram model, the other being a recursive neural-network. We show how these approaches enable us to derive complex identities, beyond reach of brute-force search, or human derivation."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of multiclass classification with an extremely large number of classes (k), with the goal of obtaining train and test time complexity logarithmic in the number of classes. We develop top-down tree construction approaches for constructing logarithmic depth trees. On the theoretical front, we formulate a new objective function, which is optimized at each node of the tree and creates dynamic partitions of the data which are both pure (in terms of class labels) and balanced. We demonstrate that under favorable conditions, we can construct logarithmic depth trees that have leaves with low label entropy. However, the objective function at the nodes is challenging to optimize computationally. We address the empirical problem with a new online decision tree construction procedure. Experiments demonstrate that this online algorithm quickly achieves improvement in test error compared to more common logarithmic training time approaches, which makes it a plausible method in computationally constrained large-k applications."}
{"text": "  Many machine learning applications involve jointly predicting multiple mutually dependent output variables. Learning to search is a family of methods where the complex decision problem is cast into a sequence of decisions via a search space. Although these methods have shown promise both in theory and in practice, implementing them has been burdensomely awkward. In this paper, we show the search space can be defined by an arbitrary imperative program, turning learning to search into a credit assignment compiler. Altogether with the algorithmic improvements for the compiler, we radically reduce the complexity of programming and the running time. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multiple joint prediction tasks. In all cases, we obtain accuracies as high as alternative approaches, at drastically reduced execution and programming time."}
{"text": "  We provide a general mechanism to design online learning algorithms based on a minimax analysis within a drifting-games framework. Different online learning settings (Hedge, multi-armed bandit problems and online convex optimization) are studied by converting into various kinds of drifting games. The original minimax analysis for drifting games is then used and generalized by applying a series of relaxations, starting from choosing a convex surrogate of the 0-1 loss function. With different choices of surrogates, we not only recover existing algorithms, but also propose new algorithms that are totally parameter-free and enjoy other useful properties. Moreover, our drifting-games framework naturally allows us to study high probability bounds without resorting to any concentration results, and also a generalized notion of regret that measures how good the algorithm is compared to all but the top small fraction of candidates. Finally, we translate our new Hedge algorithm into a new adaptive boosting algorithm that is computationally faster as shown in experiments, since it ignores a large number of examples on each round."}
{"text": "  Nonparametric regression for massive numbers of samples (n) and features (p) is an increasingly important problem. In big n settings, a common strategy is to partition the feature space, and then separately apply simple models to each partition set. We propose an alternative approach, which avoids such partitioning and the associated sensitivity to neighborhood choice and distance metrics, by using random compression combined with Gaussian process regression. The proposed approach is particularly motivated by the setting in which the response is conditionally independent of the features given the projection to a low dimensional manifold. Conditionally on the random compression matrix and a smoothness parameter, the posterior distribution for the regression surface and posterior predictive distributions are available analytically. Running the analysis in parallel for many random compression matrices and smoothness parameters, model averaging is used to combine the results. The algorithm can be implemented rapidly even in very big n and p problems, has strong theoretical justification, and is found to yield state of the art predictive performance."}
{"text": "  This paper deals with the problem of nonparametric independence testing, a fundamental decision-theoretic problem that asks if two arbitrary (possibly multivariate) random variables $X,Y$ are independent or not, a question that comes up in many fields like causality and neuroscience. While quantities like correlation of $X,Y$ only test for (univariate) linear independence, natural alternatives like mutual information of $X,Y$ are hard to estimate due to a serious curse of dimensionality. A recent approach, avoiding both issues, estimates norms of an \\textit{operator} in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). Our main contribution is strong empirical evidence that by employing \\textit{shrunk} operators when the sample size is small, one can attain an improvement in power at low false positive rates. We analyze the effects of Stein shrinkage on a popular test statistic called HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion). Our observations provide insights into two recently proposed shrinkage estimators, SCOSE and FCOSE - we prove that SCOSE is (essentially) the optimal linear shrinkage method for \\textit{estimating} the true operator; however, the non-linearly shrunk FCOSE usually achieves greater improvements in \\textit{test power}. This work is important for more powerful nonparametric detection of subtle nonlinear dependencies for small samples."}
{"text": "  Training deep directed graphical models with many hidden variables and performing inference remains a major challenge. Helmholtz machines and deep belief networks are such models, and the wake-sleep algorithm has been proposed to train them. The wake-sleep algorithm relies on training not just the directed generative model but also a conditional generative model (the inference network) that runs backward from visible to latent, estimating the posterior distribution of latent given visible. We propose a novel interpretation of the wake-sleep algorithm which suggests that better estimators of the gradient can be obtained by sampling latent variables multiple times from the inference network. This view is based on importance sampling as an estimator of the likelihood, with the approximate inference network as a proposal distribution. This interpretation is confirmed experimentally, showing that better likelihood can be achieved with this reweighted wake-sleep procedure. Based on this interpretation, we propose that a sigmoidal belief network is not sufficiently powerful for the layers of the inference network in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior distribution of latent variables. Our experiments show that using a more powerful layer model, such as NADE, yields substantially better generative models."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of low-rank tensor factorization in the presence of missing data. We ask the following question: how many sampled entries do we need, to efficiently and exactly reconstruct a tensor with a low-rank orthogonal decomposition? We propose a novel alternating minimization based method which iteratively refines estimates of the singular vectors. We show that under certain standard assumptions, our method can recover a three-mode $n\\times n\\times n$ dimensional rank-$r$ tensor exactly from $O(n^{3/2} r^5 \\log^4 n)$ randomly sampled entries. In the process of proving this result, we solve two challenging sub-problems for tensors with missing data. First, in the process of analyzing the initialization step, we prove a generalization of a celebrated result by Szemer\\'edie et al. on the spectrum of random graphs. Next, we prove global convergence of alternating minimization with a good initialization. Simulations suggest that the dependence of the sample size on dimensionality $n$ is indeed tight."}
{"text": "  This paper presents novel algorithms which exploit the intrinsic algebraic and combinatorial structure of the matrix completion task for estimating missing en- tries in the general low rank setting. For positive data, we achieve results out- performing the state of the art nuclear norm, both in accuracy and computational efficiency, in simulations and in the task of predicting athletic performance from partially observed data."}
{"text": "  This paper presents foundational theoretical results on distributed parameter estimation for undirected probabilistic graphical models.

{"text": "  We analyze the generalization and robustness of the batched weighted average algorithm for V-geometrically ergodic Markov data. This algorithm is a good alternative to the empirical risk minimization algorithm when the latter suffers from overfitting or when optimizing the empirical risk is hard. For the generalization of the algorithm, we prove a PAC-style bound on the training sample size for the expected $L_1$-loss to converge to the optimal loss when training data are V-geometrically ergodic Markov chains. For the robustness, we show that if the training target variable's values contain bounded noise, then the generalization bound of the algorithm deviates at most by the range of the noise. Our results can be applied to the regression problem, the classification problem, and the case where there exists an unknown deterministic target hypothesis."}
{"text": "  Subsampling methods have been recently proposed to speed up least squares estimation in large scale settings. However, these algorithms are typically not robust to outliers or corruptions in the observed covariates.   The concept of influence that was developed for regression diagnostics can be used to detect such corrupted observations as shown in this paper. This property of influence -- for which we also develop a randomized approximation -- motivates our proposed subsampling algorithm for large scale corrupted linear regression which limits the influence of data points since highly influential points contribute most to the residual error. Under a general model of corrupted observations, we show theoretically and empirically on a variety of simulated and real datasets that our algorithm improves over the current state-of-the-art approximation schemes for ordinary least squares."}
{"text": "  Because reinforcement learning suffers from a lack of scalability, online value (and Q-) function approximation has received increasing interest this last decade. This contribution introduces a novel approximation scheme, namely the Kalman Temporal Differences (KTD) framework, that exhibits the following features: sample-efficiency, non-linear approximation, non-stationarity handling and uncertainty management. A first KTD-based algorithm is provided for deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) which produces biased estimates in the case of stochastic transitions. Than the eXtended KTD framework (XKTD), solving stochastic MDP, is described. Convergence is analyzed for special cases for both deterministic and stochastic transitions. Related algorithms are experimented on classical benchmarks. They compare favorably to the state of the art while exhibiting the announced features."}
{"text": "  Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) and its variants have become hot research topics recently, and widely applied to many classification problems, such as character recognition and document categorization. Often, classification RBM ignores the interclass relationship or prior knowledge of sharing information among classes. In this paper, we are interested in RBM with the hierarchical prior over classes. We assume parameters for nearby nodes are correlated in the hierarchical tree, and further the parameters at each node of the tree be orthogonal to those at its ancestors. We propose a hierarchical correlated RBM for classification problem, which generalizes the classification RBM with sharing information among different classes. In order to reduce the redundancy between node parameters in the hierarchy, we also introduce orthogonal restrictions to our objective function. We test our method on challenge datasets, and show promising results compared to competitive baselines."}
{"text": "  We propose LOCO, an algorithm for large-scale ridge regression which distributes the features across workers on a cluster. Important dependencies between variables are preserved using structured random projections which are cheap to compute and must only be communicated once. We show that LOCO obtains a solution which is close to the exact ridge regression solution in the fixed design setting. We verify this experimentally in a simulation study as well as an application to climate prediction. Furthermore, we show that LOCO achieves significant speedups compared with a state-of-the-art distributed algorithm on a large-scale regression problem."}
{"text": "  Despite the fact that they do not consider the temporal nature of data, classic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, are widely applied to time series data. In this paper, we introduce a factor decomposition specific for time series that builds upon the Bayesian multivariate autoregressive model and hence evades the assumption that data points are mutually independent. The key is to find a low-rank estimation of the autoregressive matrices. As in the probabilistic version of other factor models, this induces a latent low-dimensional representation of the original data. We discuss some possible generalisations and alternatives, with the most relevant being a technique for simultaneous smoothing and dimensionality reduction. To illustrate the potential applications, we apply the model on a synthetic data set and different types of neuroimaging data (EEG and ECoG)."}
{"text": "  We evaluate the following Machine Learning techniques for Green Energy (Wind, Solar) Prediction: Bayesian Inference, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Clustering techniques (PCA). Our objective is to predict green energy using weather forecasts, predict deviations from forecast green energy, find correlation amongst different weather parameters and green energy availability, recover lost or missing energy (/ weather) data. We use historical weather data and weather forecasts for the same."}
{"text": "  Crowdsourcing is a popular paradigm for effectively collecting labels at low cost. The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers. However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other recently proposed methods."}
{"text": "  We study a sequential resource allocation problem involving a fixed number of recurring jobs. At each time-step the manager should distribute available resources among the jobs in order to maximise the expected number of completed jobs. Allocating more resources to a given job increases the probability that it completes, but with a cut-off. Specifically, we assume a linear model where the probability increases linearly until it equals one, after which allocating additional resources is wasteful. We assume the difficulty of each job is unknown and present the first algorithm for this problem and prove upper and lower bounds on its regret. Despite its apparent simplicity, the problem has a rich structure: we show that an appropriate optimistic algorithm can improve its learning speed dramatically beyond the results one normally expects for similar problems as the problem becomes resource-laden."}
{"text": "  We present a technique for significantly speeding up Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Gradient Descent (GD), two widely used algorithms for tensor factorization. By exploiting properties of the Khatri-Rao product, we show how to efficiently address a computationally challenging sub-step of both algorithms. Our algorithm, DFacTo, only requires two sparse matrix-vector products and is easy to parallelize. DFacTo is not only scalable but also on average 4 to 10 times faster than competing algorithms on a variety of datasets. For instance, DFacTo only takes 480 seconds on 4 machines to perform one iteration of the ALS algorithm and 1,143 seconds to perform one iteration of the GD algorithm on a 6.5 million x 2.5 million x 1.5 million dimensional tensor with 1.2 billion non-zero entries."}
{"text": "  Spectral learning recently generated lots of excitement in machine learning, largely because it is the first known method to produce consistent estimates (under suitable conditions) for several latent variable models. In contrast, maximum likelihood estimates may get trapped in local optima due to the non-convex nature of the likelihood function of latent variable models. In this paper, we do an empirical evaluation of spectral learning (SL) and expectation maximization (EM), which reveals an important gap between the theory and the practice. First, SL often leads to negative probabilities. Second, EM often yields better estimates than spectral learning and it does not seem to get stuck in local optima. We discuss how the rank of the model parameters and the amount of training data can yield negative probabilities. We also question the common belief that maximum likelihood estimators are necessarily inconsistent."}
{"text": "  Data mining research into time series classification (TSC) has focussed on alternative distance measures for nearest neighbour classifiers. It is standard practice to use 1-NN with Euclidean or dynamic time warping (DTW) distance as a straw man for comparison. As part of a wider investigation into elastic distance measures for TSC~\\cite{lines14elastic}, we perform a series of experiments to test whether this standard practice is valid.   Specifically, we compare 1-NN classifiers with Euclidean and DTW distance to standard classifiers, examine whether the performance of 1-NN Euclidean approaches that of 1-NN DTW as the number of cases increases, assess whether there is any benefit of setting $k$ for $k$-NN through cross validation whether it is worth setting the warping path for DTW through cross validation and finally is it better to use a window or weighting for DTW. Based on experiments on 77 problems, we conclude that 1-NN with Euclidean distance is fairly easy to beat but 1-NN with DTW is not, if window size is set through cross validation."}
{"text": "  Dictionary learning is a branch of signal processing and machine learning that aims at finding a frame (called dictionary) in which some training data admits a sparse representation. The sparser the representation, the better the dictionary. The resulting dictionary is in general a dense matrix, and its manipulation can be computationally costly both at the learning stage and later in the usage of this dictionary, for tasks such as sparse coding. Dictionary learning is thus limited to relatively small-scale problems. In this paper, inspired by usual fast transforms, we consider a general dictionary structure that allows cheaper manipulation, and propose an algorithm to learn such dictionaries --and their fast implementation-- over training data. The approach is demonstrated experimentally with the factorization of the Hadamard matrix and with synthetic dictionary learning experiments."}

{"text": "  Symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix approximation is an important problem with applications in kernel methods. However, existing SPSD matrix approximation methods such as the Nystr\\\"om method only have weak error bounds. In this paper we conduct in-depth studies of an SPSD matrix approximation model and establish strong relative-error bounds. We call it the prototype model for it has more efficient and effective extensions, and some of its extensions have high scalability. Though the prototype model itself is not suitable for large-scale data, it is still useful to study its properties, on which the analysis of its extensions relies.   This paper offers novel theoretical analysis, efficient algorithms, and a highly accurate extension. First, we establish a lower error bound for the prototype model and improve the error bound of an existing column selection algorithm to match the lower bound. In this way, we obtain the first optimal column selection algorithm for the prototype model. We also prove that the prototype model is exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simple column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Third, we propose a so-called spectral shifting model to make the approximation more accurate when the eigenvalues of the matrix decay slowly, and the improvement is theoretically quantified. The spectral shifting method can also be applied to improve other SPSD matrix approximation models."}
{"text": "  We consider statistical as well as algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. For a LS problem with input data $(X, Y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$, sketching algorithms use a sketching matrix, $S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$ with $r \\ll n$. Then, rather than solving the LS problem using the full data $(X,Y)$, sketching algorithms solve the LS problem using only the sketched data $(SX, SY)$. Prior work has typically adopted an algorithmic perspective, in that it has made no statistical assumptions on the input $X$ and $Y$, and instead it has been assumed that the data $(X,Y)$ are fixed and worst-case (WC). Prior results show that, when using sketching matrices such as random projections and leverage-score sampling algorithms, with $p < r \\ll n$, the WC error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a small constant. From a statistical perspective, we typically consider the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data $(X, Y)$ are generated according to a statistical model $Y = X \\beta + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a noise process. We provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling sketching algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $p < r \\ll n$ while the PE typically requires the sample size $r$ to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent results show that our upper bounds on PE can not be improved."}
{"text": "  We study the bandit problem where arms are associated with stationary phi-mixing processes and where rewards are therefore dependent: the question that arises from this setting is that of recovering some independence by ignoring the value of some rewards. As we shall see, the bandit problem we tackle requires us to address the exploration/exploitation/independence trade-off. To do so, we provide a UCB strategy together with a general regret analysis for the case where the size of the independence blocks (the ignored rewards) is fixed and we go a step beyond by providing an algorithm that is able to compute the size of the independence blocks from the data. Finally, we give an analysis of our bandit problem in the restless case, i.e., in the situation where the time counters for all mixing processes simultaneously evolve."}
{"text": "  In this research we address the problem of capturing recurring concepts in a data stream environment. Recurrence capture enables the re-use of previously learned classifiers without the need for re-learning while providing for better accuracy during the concept recurrence interval. We capture concepts by applying the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to Decision Tree classifiers to obtain highly compressed versions of the trees at concept drift points in the stream and store such trees in a repository for future use. Our empirical results on real world and synthetic data exhibiting varying degrees of recurrence show that the Fourier compressed trees are more robust to noise and are able to capture recurring concepts with higher precision than a meta learning approach that chooses to re-use classifiers in their originally occurring form."}
{"text": "  Mixability is a property of a loss which characterizes when fast convergence is possible in the game of prediction with expert advice. We show that a key property of mixability generalizes, and the exp and log operations present in the usual theory are not as special as one might have thought. In doing this we introduce a more general notion of $\\Phi$-mixability where $\\Phi$ is a general entropy (\\ie, any convex function on probabilities). We show how a property shared by the convex dual of any such entropy yields a natural algorithm (the minimizer of a regret bound) which, analogous to the classical aggregating algorithm, is guaranteed a constant regret when used with $\\Phi$-mixable losses. We characterize precisely which $\\Phi$ have $\\Phi$-mixable losses and put forward a number of conjectures about the optimality and relationships between different choices of entropy."}
{"text": "  Learning the parameters of graphical models using the maximum likelihood estimation is generally hard which requires an approximation. Maximum composite likelihood estimations are statistical approximations of the maximum likelihood estimation which are higher-order generalizations of the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation.

{"text": "  We consider a problem of grouping multiple graphs into several clusters using singular value thesholding and non-negative factorization. We derive a model selection information criterion to estimate the number of clusters.

{"text": "  A natural approach to analyze interaction data of form \"what-connects-to-what-when\" is to create a time-series (or rather a sequence) of graphs through temporal discretization (bandwidth selection) and spatial discretization (vertex contraction). Such discretization together with non-negative factorization techniques can be useful for obtaining clustering of graphs. Motivating application of performing clustering of graphs (as opposed to vertex clustering) can be found in neuroscience and in social network analysis, and it can also be used to enhance community detection (i.e., vertex clustering) by way of conditioning on the cluster labels. In this paper, we formulate a problem of clustering of graphs as a model selection problem. Our approach involves information criteria, non-negative matrix factorization and singular value thresholding, and we illustrate our techniques using real and simulated data."}
{"text": "  The explosion in the amount of data available for analysis often necessitates a transition from batch to incremental clustering methods, which process one element at a time and typically store only a small subset of the data. In this paper, we initiate the formal analysis of incremental clustering methods focusing on the types of cluster structure that they are able to detect. We find that the incremental setting is strictly weaker than the batch model, proving that a fundamental class of cluster structures that can readily be detected in the batch setting is impossible to identify using any incremental method. Furthermore, we show how the limitations of incremental clustering can be overcome by allowing additional clusters."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the mode-seeking framework. Given a dataset in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, we define regions of high density that we call cluster cores. We then consider a random walk on a neighborhood graph built on top of our data points which is designed to be attracted by high density regions. The strength of this attraction is controlled by a temperature parameter $\\beta > 0$. The membership of a point to a given cluster is then the probability for the random walk to hit the corresponding cluster core before any other. While many properties of random walks (such as hitting times, commute distances, etc\\dots) have been shown to enventually encode purely local information when the number of data points grows, we show that the regularization introduced by the use of cluster cores solves this issue. Empirically, we show how the choice of $\\beta$ influences the behavior of our algorithm: for small values of $\\beta$ the result is close to hard mode-seeking whereas when $\\beta$ is close to $1$ the result is similar to the output of a (fuzzy) spectral clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by providing the fuzzy clustering of a protein configuration dataset containing a million data points in $30$ dimensions."}
{"text": "  We consider the class of optimization problems arising from computationally intensive L1-regularized M-estimators, where the function or gradient values are very expensive to compute. A particular instance of interest is the L1-regularized MLE for learning Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which are a popular class of statistical models for varied structured prediction problems such as sequence labeling, alignment, and classification with label taxonomy. L1-regularized MLEs for CRFs are particularly expensive to optimize since computing the gradient values requires an expensive inference step. In this work, we propose the use of a carefully constructed proximal quasi-Newton algorithm for such computationally intensive M-estimation problems, where we employ an aggressive active set selection technique. In a key contribution of the paper, we show that the proximal quasi-Newton method is provably super-linearly convergent, even in the absence of strong convexity, by leveraging a restricted variant of strong convexity. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm converges considerably faster than current state-of-the-art on the problems of sequence labeling and hierarchical classification."}

{"text": "  Structure learning of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) can be cast into an L1-regularized optimization problem. To avoid optimizing over a fully linked model, gain-based or gradient-based feature selection methods start from an empty model and incrementally add top ranked features to it. However, for high-dimensional problems like statistical relational learning, training time of these incremental methods can be dominated by the cost of evaluating the gain or gradient of a large collection of candidate features. In this study we propose a fast feature evaluation algorithm called Contrastive Feature Induction (CFI), which only evaluates a subset of features that involve both variables with high signals (deviation from mean) and variables with high errors (residue). We prove that the gradient of candidate features can be represented solely as a function of signals and errors, and that CFI is an efficient approximation of gradient-based evaluation methods. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets show competitive learning speed and accuracy of CFI on pairwise CRFs, compared to state-of-the-art structure learning methods such as full optimization over all features, and Grafting."}
{"text": "  We consider stochastic bandit problems with a continuous set of arms and where the expected reward is a continuous and unimodal function of the arm. No further assumption is made regarding the smoothness and the structure of the expected reward function. For these problems, we propose the Stochastic Pentachotomy (SP) algorithm, and derive finite-time upper bounds on its regret and optimization error. In particular, we show that, for any expected reward function $\\mu$ that behaves as $\\mu(x)=\\mu(x^\\star)-C|x-x^\\star|^\\xi$ locally around its maximizer $x^\\star$ for some $\\xi, C>0$, the SP algorithm is order-optimal. Namely its regret and optimization error scale as $O(\\sqrt{T\\log(T)})$ and $O(\\sqrt{\\log(T)/T})$, respectively, when the time horizon $T$ grows large. These scalings are achieved without the knowledge of $\\xi$ and $C$. Our algorithm is based on asymptotically optimal sequential statistical tests used to successively trim an interval that contains the best arm with high probability. To our knowledge, the SP algorithm constitutes the first sequential arm selection rule that achieves a regret and optimization error scaling as $O(\\sqrt{T})$ and $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, respectively, up to a logarithmic factor for non-smooth expected reward functions, as well as for smooth functions with unknown smoothness."}
{"text": "  Estimation of density derivatives is a versatile tool in statistical data analysis. A naive approach is to first estimate the density and then compute its derivative. However, such a two-step approach does not work well because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density-derivative estimator. In this paper, we give a direct method to approximate the density derivative without estimating the density itself. Our proposed estimator allows analytic and computationally efficient approximation of multi-dimensional high-order density derivatives, with the ability that all hyper-parameters can be chosen objectively by cross-validation. We further show that the proposed density-derivative estimator is useful in improving the accuracy of non-parametric KL-divergence estimation via metric learning. The practical superiority of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated in change detection and feature selection."}
{"text": "  Two types of low cost-per-iteration gradient descent methods have been extensively studied in parallel. One is online or stochastic gradient descent (OGD/SGD), and the other is randomzied coordinate descent (RBCD). In this paper, we combine the two types of methods together and propose online randomized block coordinate descent (ORBCD). At each iteration, ORBCD only computes the partial gradient of one block coordinate of one mini-batch samples. ORBCD is well suited for the composite minimization problem where one function is the average of the losses of a large number of samples and the other is a simple regularizer defined on high dimensional variables. We show that the iteration complexity of ORBCD has the same order as OGD or SGD. For strongly convex functions, by reducing the variance of stochastic gradients, we show that ORBCD can converge at a geometric rate in expectation, matching the convergence rate of SGD with variance reduction and RBCD."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of learning sparse structure changes between two Markov networks $P$ and $Q$. Rather than fitting two Markov networks separately to two sets of data and figuring out their differences, a recent work proposed to learn changes \\emph{directly} via estimating the ratio between two Markov network models. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for \\emph{successful change detection} with respect to the sample size $n_p, n_q$, the dimension of data $m$, and the number of changed edges $d$. When using an unbounded density ratio model we prove that the true sparse changes can be consistently identified for $n_p = \\Omega(d^2 \\log \\frac{m^2+m}{2})$ and $n_q = \\Omega({n_p^2})$, with an exponentially decaying upper-bound on learning error. Such sample complexity can be improved to $\\min(n_p, n_q) = \\Omega(d^2 \\log \\frac{m^2+m}{2})$ when the boundedness of the density ratio model is assumed. Our theoretical guarantee can be applied to a wide range of discrete/continuous Markov networks."}
{"text": "  Which ads should we display in sponsored search in order to maximize our revenue? How should we dynamically rank information sources to maximize the value of the ranking? These applications exhibit strong diminishing returns: Redundancy decreases the marginal utility of each ad or information source. We show that these and other problems can be formalized as repeatedly selecting an assignment of items to positions to maximize a sequence of monotone submodular functions that arrive one by one. We present an efficient algorithm for this general problem and analyze it in the no-regret model. Our algorithm possesses strong theoretical guarantees, such as a performance ratio that converges to the optimal constant of 1 - 1/e. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on two real-world online optimization problems on the web: ad allocation with submodular utilities, and dynamically ranking blogs to detect information cascades. Finally, we present a second algorithm that handles the more general case in which the feasible sets are given by a matroid constraint, while still maintaining a 1 - 1/e asymptotic performance ratio."}
{"text": "  Multi-label learning deals with the classification problems where each instance can be assigned with multiple labels simultaneously. Conventional multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations. It is usually assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that the label sets for training instances are fully labeled without any missing labels. However, in many real-world multi-label datasets, the label assignments for training instances can be incomplete. Some ground-truth labels can be missed by the labeler from the label set. This problem is especially typical when the number instances is very large, and the labeling cost is very high, which makes it almost impossible to get a fully labeled training set. In this paper, we study the problem of large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label assignments. We propose an approach, called MPU, based upon positive and unlabeled stochastic gradient descent and stacked models. Unlike prior works, our method can effectively and efficiently consider missing labels and label correlations simultaneously, and is very scalable, that has linear time complexities over the size of the data. Extensive experiments on two real-world multi-label datasets show that our MPU model consistently outperform other commonly-used baselines."}
{"text": "  Many problems in real-world applications involve predicting several random variables which are statistically related. Markov random fields (MRFs) are a great mathematical tool to encode such relationships. The goal of this paper is to combine MRFs with deep learning algorithms to estimate complex representations while taking into account the dependencies between the output random variables. Towards this goal, we propose a training algorithm that is able to learn structured models jointly with deep features that form the MRF potentials. Our approach is efficient as it blends learning and inference and makes use of GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in the tasks of predicting words from noisy images, as well as multi-class classification of Flickr photographs. We show that joint learning of the deep features and the MRF parameters results in significant performance gains."}
{"text": "  This document describes a novel learning algorithm that classifies \"bags\" of instances rather than individual instances. A bag is labeled positive if it contains at least one positive instance (which may or may not be specifically identified), and negative otherwise. This class of problems is known as multi-instance learning problems, and is useful in situations where the class label at an instance level may be unavailable or imprecise or difficult to obtain, or in situations where the problem is naturally posed as one of classifying instance groups. The algorithm described here is an ensemble-based method, wherein the members of the ensemble are lazy learning classifiers learnt using the Citation Nearest Neighbour method. Diversity among the ensemble members is achieved by optimizing their parameters using a multi-objective optimization method, with the objectives being to maximize Class 1 accuracy and minimize false positive rate. The method has been found to be effective on the Musk1 benchmark dataset."}
{"text": "  The subspace Restricted Boltzmann Machine (subspaceRBM) is a third-order Boltzmann machine where multiplicative interactions are between one visible and two hidden units. There are two kinds of hidden units, namely, gate units and subspace units. The subspace units reflect variations of a pattern in data and the gate unit is responsible for activating the subspace units. Additionally, the gate unit can be seen as a pooling feature. We evaluate the behavior of subspaceRBM through experiments with MNIST digit recognition task, measuring reconstruction error and classification error."}
{"text": "  Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a widely used statistical tool with both well established theory and favorable performance for a wide range of machine learning problems. However, computing CCA for huge datasets can be very slow since it involves implementing QR decomposition or singular value decomposition of huge matrices. In this paper we introduce L-CCA, a iterative algorithm which can compute CCA fast on huge sparse datasets. Theory on both the asymptotic convergence and finite time accuracy of L-CCA are established. The experiments also show that L-CCA outperform other fast CCA approximation schemes on two real datasets."}
{"text": "  No matter the expressive power and sophistication of supervised learning algorithms, their effectiveness is restricted by the features describing the data. This is not a new insight in ML and many methods for feature selection, transformation, and construction have been developed. But while this is on-going for general techniques for feature selection and transformation, i.e. dimensionality reduction, work on feature construction, i.e. enriching the data, is by now mainly the domain of image, particularly character, recognition, and NLP.   In this work, we propose a new general framework for feature construction. The need for feature construction in a data set is indicated by class outliers and discriminative pattern mining used to derive features on their k-neighborhoods. We instantiate the framework with LOF and C4.5-Rules, and evaluate the usefulness of the derived features on a diverse collection of UCI data sets. The derived features are more often useful than ones derived by DC-Fringe, and our approach is much less likely to overfit. But while a weak learner, Naive Bayes, benefits strongly from the feature construction, the effect is less pronounced for C4.5, and almost vanishes for an SVM leaner.

{"text": "  The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases. Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (l2 penalty) or scattered (l1 penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of l1, l2, and TV penalties while preserving the exact l1 penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions."}
{"text": "  In the last several years, the intimate connection between convex optimization and learning problems, in both statistical and sequential frameworks, has shifted the focus of algorithmic machine learning to examine this interplay. In particular, on one hand, this intertwinement brings forward new challenges in reassessment of the performance of learning algorithms including generalization and regret bounds under the assumptions imposed by convexity such as analytical properties of loss functions (e.g., Lipschitzness, strong convexity, and smoothness). On the other hand, emergence of datasets of an unprecedented size, demands the development of novel and more efficient optimization algorithms to tackle large-scale learning problems.   The overarching goal of this thesis is to reassess the smoothness of loss functions in statistical learning, sequential prediction/online learning, and stochastic optimization and explicate its consequences. In particular we examine how smoothness of loss function could be beneficial or detrimental in these settings in terms of sample complexity, statistical consistency, regret analysis, and convergence rate, and investigate how smoothness can be leveraged to devise more efficient learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  Many graph clustering quality functions suffer from a resolution limit, the inability to find small clusters in large graphs. So called resolution-limit-free quality functions do not have this limit. This property was previously introduced for hard clustering, that is, graph partitioning.   We investigate the resolution-limit-free property in the context of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for hard and soft graph clustering. To use NMF in the hard clustering setting, a common approach is to assign each node to its highest membership cluster. We show that in this case symmetric NMF is not resolution-limit-free, but that it becomes so when hardness constraints are used as part of the optimization. The resulting function is strongly linked to the Constant Potts Model. In soft clustering, nodes can belong to more than one cluster, with varying degrees of membership. In this setting resolution-limit-free turns out to be too strong a property. Therefore we introduce locality, which roughly states that changing one part of the graph does not affect the clustering of other parts of the graph. We argue that this is a desirable property, provide conditions under which NMF quality functions are local, and propose a novel class of local probabilistic NMF quality functions for soft graph clustering."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a Bayesian generative model for dependent Cox point processes, alongside an efficient inference scheme which scales as if the point processes were modelled independently. We can handle missing data naturally, infer latent structure, and cope with large numbers of observed processes. A further novel contribution enables the model to work effectively in higher dimensional spaces. Using this method, we achieve vastly improved predictive performance on both 2D and 1D real data, validating our structured approach."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a Fast Synchronization Clustering algorithm (FSynC), which is an improved version of SynC algorithm. In order to decrease the time complexity of the original SynC algorithm, we combine grid cell partitioning method and Red-Black tree to construct the near neighbor point set of every point. By simulated experiments of some artificial data sets and several real data sets, we observe that FSynC algorithm can often get less time than SynC algorithm for many kinds of data sets. At last, it gives some research expectations to popularize this algorithm."}
{"text": "  Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results.   Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn.   In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions. In consequence of this work, our analysis demonstrates that variable importances [...]."}
{"text": "  We consider sequential decision making in a setting where regret is measured with respect to a set of stateful reference policies, and feedback is limited to observing the rewards of the actions performed (the so called \"bandit\" setting). If either the reference policies are stateless rather than stateful, or the feedback includes the rewards of all actions (the so called \"expert\" setting), previous work shows that the optimal regret grows like $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the number of decision rounds $T$.   The difficulty in our setting is that the decision maker unavoidably loses track of the internal states of the reference policies, and thus cannot reliably attribute rewards observed in a certain round to any of the reference policies. In fact, in this setting it is impossible for the algorithm to estimate which policy gives the highest (or even approximately highest) total reward. Nevertheless, we design an algorithm that achieves expected regret that is sublinear in $T$, of the form $O( T/\\log^{1/4}{T})$. Our algorithm is based on a certain local repetition lemma that may be of independent interest. We also show that no algorithm can guarantee expected regret better than $O( T/\\log^{3/2} T)$."}
{"text": "  Many real-life data are described by categorical attributes without a pre-classification. A common data mining method used to extract information from this type of data is clustering. This method group together the samples from the data that are more similar than all other samples. But, categorical data pose a challenge when extracting information because: the calculation of two objects similarity is usually done by measuring the number of common features, but ignore a possible importance weighting; if the data may be divided differently according to different subsets of the features, the algorithm may find clusters with different meanings from each other, difficulting the post analysis. Data Co-Clustering of categorical data is the technique that tries to find subsets of samples that share a subset of features in common. By doing so, not only a sample may belong to more than one cluster but, the feature selection of each cluster describe its own characteristics. In this paper a novel Co-Clustering technique for categorical data is proposed by using Locality Sensitive Hashing technique in order to preprocess a list of Co-Clusters seeds based on a previous research. Results indicate this technique is capable of finding high quality Co-Clusters in many different categorical data sets and scales linearly with the data set size."}
{"text": "  Matrix factorization (MF) has become a common approach to collaborative filtering, due to ease of implementation and scalability to large data sets. Two existing drawbacks of the basic model is that it does not incorporate side information on either users or items, and assumes a common variance for all users. We extend the work of constrained probabilistic matrix factorization by deriving the Gibbs updates for the side feature vectors for items (Salakhutdinov and Minh, 2008). We show that this Bayesian treatment to the constrained PMF model outperforms simple MAP estimation. We also consider extensions to heteroskedastic precision introduced in the literature (Lakshminarayanan, Bouchard, and Archambeau, 2011). We show that this tends result in overfitting for deterministic approximation algorithms (ex: Variational inference) when the observed entries in the user / item matrix are distributed in an non-uniform manner. In light of this, we propose a truncated precision model. Our experimental results suggest that this model tends to delay overfitting."}
{"text": "  We propose to exploit {\\em reconstruction} as a layer-local training signal for deep learning. Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them, flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations."}
{"text": "  We introduce a means of automating machine learning (ML) for big data tasks, by performing scalable stochastic Bayesian optimisation of ML algorithm parameters and hyper-parameters. More often than not, the critical tuning of ML algorithm parameters has relied on domain expertise from experts, along with laborious hand-tuning, brute search or lengthy sampling runs. Against this background, Bayesian optimisation is finding increasing use in automating parameter tuning, making ML algorithms accessible even to non-experts. However, the state of the art in Bayesian optimisation is incapable of scaling to the large number of evaluations of algorithm performance required to fit realistic models to complex, big data. We here describe a stochastic, sparse, Bayesian optimisation strategy to solve this problem, using many thousands of noisy evaluations of algorithm performance on subsets of data in order to effectively train algorithms for big data. We provide a comprehensive benchmarking of possible sparsification strategies for Bayesian optimisation, concluding that a Nystrom approximation offers the best scaling and performance for real tasks. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement over the state of the art in tuning the parameters of a Gaussian Process time series prediction task on real, big data."}
{"text": "  With advances in data collection technologies, tensor data is assuming increasing prominence in many applications and the problem of supervised tensor learning has emerged as a topic of critical significance in the data mining and machine learning community. Conventional methods for supervised tensor learning mainly focus on learning kernels by flattening the tensor into vectors or matrices, however structural information within the tensors will be lost. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme to design structure-preserving kernels for supervised tensor learning. Specifically, we demonstrate how to leverage the naturally available structure within the tensorial representation to encode prior knowledge in the kernel. We proposed a tensor kernel that can preserve tensor structures based upon dual-tensorial mapping. The dual-tensorial mapping function can map each tensor instance in the input space to another tensor in the feature space while preserving the tensorial structure. Theoretically, our approach is an extension of the conventional kernels in the vector space to tensor space. We applied our novel kernel in conjunction with SVM to real-world tensor classification problems including brain fMRI classification for three different diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, ADHD and brain damage by HIV). Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed approach can effectively boost tensor classification performances, particularly with small sample sizes."}
{"text": "  We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems, where subsets of base arms with unknown distributions form super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the base arms contained in the super arm are played and their outcomes are observed. We further consider the extension in which more based arms could be probabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms. The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline (\\alpha,\\beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {\\beta} generates an {\\alpha} fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of an online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize (\\alpha,\\beta)-approximation regret, which is the difference between the \\alpha{\\beta} fraction of the expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n) distribution-dependent regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1 algorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it significantly improves the regret bound in a earlier paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage and social influence maximization, both having nonlinear reward structures. In particular, application to social influence maximization requires our extension on probabilistically triggered arms."}
{"text": "  This contribution deals with the generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm in the domain of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The generalized symmetric version of FastICA has been shown to have the potential to achieve the Cram\\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) by allowing the usage of different nonlinearity functions in its parallel implementations of one-unit FastICA. In spite of this appealing property, a rigorous study of the asymptotic error of the generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm is still missing in the community. In fact, all the existing results exhibit certain limitations, such as ignoring the impact of data standardization on the asymptotic statistics or being based on a heuristic approach.   In this work, we aim at filling this blank.   The first result of this contribution is the characterization of the limits of the generalized symmetric FastICA. It is shown that the algorithm optimizes a function that is a sum of the contrast functions used by traditional one-unit FastICA with a correction of the sign. Based on this characterization, we derive a closed-form analytic expression of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the generalized symmetric FastICA estimator using the method of estimating equation and M-estimator."}
{"text": "  A large amount of observational data has been accumulated in various fields in recent times, and there is a growing need to estimate the generating processes of these data. A linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) based on the non-Gaussianity of external influences has been proposed to estimate the data-generating processes of variables. However, the results of the estimation can be biased if there are latent classes. In this paper, we first review LiNGAM, its extended model, as well as the estimation procedure for LiNGAM in a Bayesian framework. We then propose a new Bayesian estimation procedure that solves the problem."}
{"text": "  Recently, there has been focus on penalized log-likelihood covariance estimation for sparse inverse covariance (precision) matrices. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity, and a very common choice is the convex $l_1$ norm. However, the best estimator performance is not always achieved with this penalty. The most natural sparsity promoting \"norm\" is the non-convex $l_0$ penalty but its lack of convexity has deterred its use in sparse maximum likelihood estimation. In this paper we consider non-convex $l_0$ penalized log-likelihood inverse covariance estimation and present a novel cyclic descent algorithm for its optimization. Convergence to a local minimizer is proved, which is highly non-trivial, and we demonstrate via simulations the reduced bias and superior quality of the $l_0$ penalty as compared to the $l_1$ penalty."}
{"text": "  This paper generalizes an important result from the PAC-Bayesian literature for binary classification to the case of ensemble methods for structured outputs. We prove a generic version of the \\Cbound, an upper bound over the risk of models expressed as a weighted majority vote that is based on the first and second statistical moments of the vote's margin. This bound may advantageously $(i)$ be applied on more complex outputs such as multiclass labels and multilabel, and $(ii)$ allow to consider margin relaxations. These results open the way to develop new ensemble methods for structured output prediction with PAC-Bayesian guarantees."}
{"text": "  Many of the ordinal regression models that have been proposed in the literature can be seen as methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the zero-one, absolute, or squared loss functions. A key property that allows to study the statistical implications of such approximations is that of Fisher consistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss functions and implies that in the population setting, i.e., if the probability distribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the surrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will characterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss functions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that, for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal regression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex margin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also derive excess risk bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk bounds for binary classification. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel surrogate of the squared error loss. We compare this novel surrogate with competing approaches on 9 different datasets. Our method shows to be highly competitive in practice, outperforming the least squares loss on 7 out of 9 datasets."}
{"text": "  We study the attainable regret for online linear optimization problems with bandit feedback, where unlike the full-information setting, the player can only observe its own loss rather than the full loss vector. We show that the price of bandit information in this setting can be as large as $d$, disproving the well-known conjecture that the regret for bandit linear optimization is at most $\\sqrt{d}$ times the full-information regret. Surprisingly, this is shown using \"trivial\" modifications of standard domains, which have no effect in the full-information setting. This and other results we present highlight some interesting differences between full-information and bandit learning, which were not considered in previous literature."}
{"text": "  We prove new fast learning rates for the one-vs-all multiclass plug-in classifiers trained either from exponentially strongly mixing data or from data generated by a converging drifting distribution. These are two typical scenarios where training data are not iid. The learning rates are obtained under a multiclass version of Tsybakov's margin assumption, a type of low-noise assumption, and do not depend on the number of classes. Our results are general and include a previous result for binary-class plug-in classifiers with iid data as a special case. In contrast to previous works for least squares SVMs under the binary-class setting, our results retain the optimal learning rate in the iid case."}
{"text": "  The VC dimension measures the capacity of a learning machine, and a low VC dimension leads to good generalization. While SVMs produce state-of-the-art learning performance, it is well known that the VC dimension of a SVM can be unbounded; despite good results in practice, there is no guarantee of good generalization. In this paper, we show how to learn a hyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact, or \\boldmath{$\\Theta$} bound on its VC dimension. The proposed approach, termed as the Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM), involves solving a simple linear programming problem. Experimental results show, that on a number of benchmark datasets, the proposed approach learns classifiers with error rates much less than conventional SVMs, while often using fewer support vectors. On many benchmark datasets, the number of support vectors is less than one-tenth the number used by SVMs, indicating that the MCM does indeed learn simpler representations."}
{"text": "  In this paper, a robust online sequential extreme learning machine (ROS-ELM) is proposed. It is based on the original OS-ELM with an adaptive selective ensemble framework. Two novel insights are proposed in this paper. First, a novel selective ensemble algorithm referred to as particle swarm optimization selective ensemble (PSOSEN) is proposed. Noting that PSOSEN is a general selective ensemble method which is applicable to any learning algorithms, including batch learning and online learning. Second, an adaptive selective ensemble framework for online learning is designed to balance the robustness and complexity of the algorithm. Experiments for both regression and classification problems with UCI data sets are carried out. Comparisons between OS-ELM, simple ensemble OS-ELM (EOS-ELM) and the proposed ROS-ELM empirically show that ROS-ELM significantly improves the robustness and stability."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel approach to sufficient dimension reduction in regression, based on estimating contour directions of negligible variation for the response surface. These directions span the orthogonal complement of the minimal space relevant for the regression, and can be extracted according to a measure of the variation in the response, leading to General Contour Regression(GCR). In comparison to exiisting sufficient dimension reduction techniques, this sontour-based mothology guarantees exhaustive estimation of the central space under ellipticity of the predictoor distribution and very mild additional assumptions, while maintaining vn-consisytency and somputational ease. Moreover, it proves to be robust to departures from ellipticity. We also establish some useful population properties for GCR. Simulations to compare performance with that of standard techniques such as ordinary least squares, sliced inverse regression, principal hessian directions, and sliced average variance estimation confirm the advntages anticipated by theoretical analyses. We also demonstrate the use of contour-based methods on a data set concerning grades of students from Massachusetts colleges."}
{"text": "  We define the beta diffusion tree, a random tree structure with a set of leaves that defines a collection of overlapping subsets of objects, known as a feature allocation. A generative process for the tree structure is defined in terms of particles (representing the objects) diffusing in some continuous space, analogously to the Dirichlet diffusion tree (Neal, 2003), which defines a tree structure over partitions (i.e., non-overlapping subsets) of the objects. Unlike in the Dirichlet diffusion tree, multiple copies of a particle may exist and diffuse along multiple branches in the beta diffusion tree, and an object may therefore belong to multiple subsets of particles. We demonstrate how to build a hierarchically-clustered factor analysis model with the beta diffusion tree and how to perform inference over the random tree structures with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conclude with several numerical experiments on missing data problems with data sets of gene expression microarrays, international development statistics, and intranational socioeconomic measurements."}
{"text": "  Vehicular sensor data consists of multiple time-series arising from a number of sensors. Using such multi-sensor data we would like to detect occurrences of specific events that vehicles encounter, e.g., corresponding to particular maneuvers that a vehicle makes or conditions that it encounters. Events are characterized by similar waveform patterns re-appearing within one or more sensors. Further such patterns can be of variable duration. In this work, we propose a method for detecting such events in time-series data using a novel feature descriptor motivated by similar ideas in image processing. We define the shape histogram: a constant dimension descriptor that nevertheless captures patterns of variable duration. We demonstrate the efficacy of using shape histograms as features to detect events in an SVM-based, multi-sensor, supervised learning scenario, i.e., multiple time-series are used to detect an event. We present results on real-life vehicular sensor data and show that our technique performs better than available pattern detection implementations on our data, and that it can also be used to combine features from multiple sensors resulting in better accuracy than using any single sensor. Since previous work on pattern detection in time-series has been in the single series context, we also present results using our technique on multiple standard time-series datasets and show that it is the most versatile in terms of how it ranks compared to other published results."}

{"text": "  Traditionally, Multi-task Learning (MTL) models optimize the average of task-related objective functions, which is an intuitive approach and which we will be referring to as Average MTL. However, a more general framework, referred to as Conic MTL, can be formulated by considering conic combinations of the objective functions instead; in this framework, Average MTL arises as a special case, when all combination coefficients equal 1. Although the advantage of Conic MTL over Average MTL has been shown experimentally in previous works, no theoretical justification has been provided to date. In this paper, we derive a generalization bound for the Conic MTL method, and demonstrate that the tightest bound is not necessarily achieved, when all combination coefficients equal 1; hence, Average MTL may not always be the optimal choice, and it is important to consider Conic MTL. As a byproduct of the generalization bound, it also theoretically explains the good experimental results of previous relevant works. Finally, we propose a new Conic MTL model, whose conic combination coefficients minimize the generalization bound, instead of choosing them heuristically as has been done in previous methods. The rationale and advantage of our model is demonstrated and verified via a series of experiments by comparing with several other methods."}
{"text": "  A large number of algorithms in machine learning, from principal component analysis (PCA), and its non-linear (kernel) extensions, to more recent spectral embedding and support estimation methods, rely on estimating a linear subspace from samples. In this paper we introduce a general formulation of this problem and derive novel learning error estimates. Our results rely on natural assumptions on the spectral properties of the covariance operator associated to the data distribu- tion, and hold for a wide class of metrics between subspaces. As special cases, we discuss sharp error estimates for the reconstruction properties of PCA and spectral support estimation. Key to our analysis is an operator theoretic approach that has broad applicability to spectral learning methods."}
{"text": "  A wild bootstrap method for nonparametric hypothesis tests based on kernel distribution embeddings is proposed. This bootstrap method is used to construct provably consistent tests that apply to random processes, for which the naive permutation-based bootstrap fails. It applies to a large group of kernel tests based on V-statistics, which are degenerate under the null hypothesis, and non-degenerate elsewhere. To illustrate this approach, we construct a two-sample test, an instantaneous independence test and a multiple lag independence test for time series. In experiments, the wild bootstrap gives strong performance on synthetic examples, on audio data, and in performance benchmarking for the Gibbs sampler."}

Experimental results show superior performance on both simulated and real data sets compared to Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), kernel-based Information Complexity (ICOMP), and maximum log of marginal likelihood in Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)."}
{"text": "  We study the distributed computing setting in which there are multiple servers, each holding a set of points, who wish to compute functions on the union of their point sets. A key task in this setting is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in which the servers would like to compute a low dimensional subspace capturing as much of the variance of the union of their point sets as possible. Given a procedure for approximate PCA, one can use it to approximately solve $\\ell_2$-error fitting problems such as $k$-means clustering and subspace clustering. The essential properties of an approximate distributed PCA algorithm are its communication cost and computational efficiency for a given desired accuracy in downstream applications. We give new algorithms and analyses for distributed PCA which lead to improved communication and computational costs for $k$-means clustering and related problems. Our empirical study on real world data shows a speedup of orders of magnitude, preserving communication with only a negligible degradation in solution quality. Some of these techniques we develop, such as a general transformation from a constant success probability subspace embedding to a high success probability subspace embedding with a dimension and sparsity independent of the success probability, may be of independent interest."}
{"text": "  Although multi-label learning can deal with many problems with label ambiguity, it does not fit some real applications well where the overall distribution of the importance of the labels matters. This paper proposes a novel learning paradigm named \\emph{label distribution learning} (LDL) for such kind of applications. The label distribution covers a certain number of labels, representing the degree to which each label describes the instance. LDL is a more general learning framework which includes both single-label and multi-label learning as its special cases. This paper proposes six working LDL algorithms in three ways: problem transformation, algorithm adaptation, and specialized algorithm design. In order to compare the performance of the LDL algorithms, six representative and diverse evaluation measures are selected via a clustering analysis, and the first batch of label distribution datasets are collected and made publicly available. Experimental results on one artificial and fifteen real-world datasets show clear advantages of the specialized algorithms, which indicates the importance of special design for the characteristics of the LDL problem."}
{"text": "  This paper describes the solution of Bazinga Team for Tmall Recommendation Prize 2014. With real-world user action data provided by Tmall, one of the largest B2C online retail platforms in China, this competition requires to predict future user purchases on Tmall website. Predictions are judged on F1Score, which considers both precision and recall for fair evaluation. The data set provided by Tmall contains more than half billion action records from over ten million distinct users. Such massive data volume poses a big challenge, and drives competitors to write every single program in MapReduce fashion and run it on distributed cluster. We model the purchase prediction problem as standard machine learning problem, and mainly employ regression and classification methods as single models. Individual models are then aggregated in a two-stage approach, using linear regression for blending, and finally a linear ensemble of blended models. The competition is approaching the end but still in running during writing this paper. In the end, our team achieves F1Score 6.11 and ranks 7th (out of 7,276 teams in total)."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study the generalization performance of regularized multi-task learning (RMTL) in a vector-valued framework, where MTL is considered as a learning process for vector-valued functions. We are mainly concerned with two theoretical questions: 1) under what conditions does RMTL perform better with a smaller task sample size than STL? 2) under what conditions is RMTL generalizable and can guarantee the consistency of each task during simultaneous learning?   In particular, we investigate two types of task-group relatedness: the observed discrepancy-dependence measure (ODDM) and the empirical discrepancy-dependence measure (EDDM), both of which detect the dependence between two groups of multiple related tasks (MRTs). We then introduce the Cartesian product-based uniform entropy number (CPUEN) to measure the complexities of vector-valued function classes. By applying the specific deviation and the symmetrization inequalities to the vector-valued framework, we obtain the generalization bound for RMTL, which is the upper bound of the joint probability of the event that there is at least one task with a large empirical discrepancy between the expected and empirical risks. Finally, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee the consistency of each task in the simultaneous learning process, and we discuss how task relatedness affects the generalization performance of RMTL. Our theoretical findings answer the aforementioned two questions."}
{"text": "  The FastICA algorithm is one of the most popular iterative algorithms in the domain of linear independent component analysis. Despite its success, it is observed that FastICA occasionally yields outcomes that do not correspond to any true solutions (known as demixing vectors) of the ICA problem. These outcomes are commonly referred to as spurious solutions. Although FastICA is among the most extensively studied ICA algorithms, the occurrence of spurious solutions are not yet completely understood by the community. In this contribution, we aim at addressing this issue. In the first part of this work, we are interested in the relationship between demixing vectors, local optimizers of the contrast function and (attractive or unattractive) fixed points of FastICA algorithm. Characterizations of these sets are given, and an inclusion relationship is discovered. In the second part, we investigate the possible scenarios where spurious solutions occur. We show that when certain bimodal Gaussian mixtures distributions are involved, there may exist spurious solutions that are attractive fixed points of FastICA. In this case, popular nonlinearities such as \"gauss\" or \"tanh\" tend to yield spurious solutions, whereas only \"kurtosis\" may give reliable results. Some advices are given for the practical choice of nonlinearity function."}
{"text": "  Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are amongst the best performing models for structured computer vision tasks, such as semantic image segmentation or human pose estimation. Training SSVMs, however, is computationally costly, because it requires repeated calls to a structured prediction subroutine (called \\emph{max-oracle}), which has to solve an optimization problem itself, e.g. a graph cut.   In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for SSVM training that is more efficient than earlier techniques when the max-oracle is computationally expensive, as it is frequently the case in computer vision tasks. The main idea is to (i) combine the recent stochastic Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm with efficient hyperplane caching, and (ii) use an automatic selection rule for deciding whether to call the exact max-oracle or to rely on an approximate one based on the cached hyperplanes.   We show experimentally that this strategy leads to faster convergence to the optimum with respect to the number of requires oracle calls, and that this translates into faster convergence with respect to the total runtime when the max-oracle is slow compared to the other steps of the algorithm.   A publicly available C++ implementation is provided at http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/papers/SVM.html ."}
{"text": "  Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally expensive. Both the calculation of the acceptance probability and the creation of informed proposals usually require an iteration through the whole data set. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem by generating proposals which are only based on a subset of the data, by skipping the accept-reject step and by using decreasing step-sizes sequence $(\\delta_m)_{m \\geq 0}$.   %Under appropriate Lyapunov conditions, We provide in this article a rigorous mathematical framework for analysing this algorithm. We prove that, under verifiable assumptions, the algorithm is consistent, satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) and its asymptotic bias-variance decomposition can be characterized by an explicit functional of the step-sizes sequence $(\\delta_m)_{m \\geq 0}$. We leverage this analysis to give practical recommendations for the notoriously difficult tuning of this algorithm: it is asymptotically optimal to use a step-size sequence of the type $\\delta_m \\asymp m^{-1/3}$, leading to an algorithm whose mean squared error (MSE) decreases at rate $\\mathcal{O}(m^{-1/3})$"}
{"text": "  In this paper, the Dempster-Shafer method is employed as the theoretical basis for creating data classification systems. Testing is carried out using three popular (multiple attribute) benchmark datasets that have two, three and four classes. In each case, a subset of the available data is used for training to establish thresholds, limits or likelihoods of class membership for each attribute, and hence create mass functions that establish probability of class membership for each attribute of the test data. Classification of each data item is achieved by combination of these probabilities via Dempster's Rule of Combination. Results for the first two datasets show extremely high classification accuracy that is competitive with other popular methods. The third dataset is non-numerical and difficult to classify, but good results can be achieved provided the system and mass functions are designed carefully and the right attributes are chosen for combination. In all cases the Dempster-Shafer method provides comparable performance to other more popular algorithms, but the overhead of generating accurate mass functions increases the complexity with the addition of new attributes. Overall, the results suggest that the D-S approach provides a suitable framework for the design of classification systems and that automating the mass function design and calculation would increase the viability of the algorithm for complex classification problems."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a new solution for choosing the K parameter in the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, the solution depending on the idea of ensemble learning, in which a weak KNN classifier is used each time with a different K, starting from one to the square root of the size of the training set. The results of the weak classifiers are combined using the weighted sum rule. The proposed solution was tested and compared to other solutions using a group of experiments in real life problems. The experimental results show that the proposed classifier outperforms the traditional KNN classifier that uses a different number of neighbors, is competitive with other classifiers, and is a promising classifier with strong potential for a wide range of applications."}

The proposed similarity measure is invariant to large differences in some dimensions in the feature space. The proposed metric is proved mathematically to be a metric. To test its viability for different applications, the KNN used the proposed metric for classifying test examples chosen from a number of real datasets. Compared to some other well known metrics, the experimental results show that the proposed metric is a promising distance measure for the KNN classifier with strong potential for a wide range of applications."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose the problem of domain transfer structured output learn- ing and the first solution to solve it. The problem is defined on two different data domains sharing the same input and output spaces, named as source domain and target domain. The outputs are structured, and for the data samples of the source domain, the corresponding outputs are available, while for most data samples of the target domain, the corresponding outputs are missing. The input distributions of the two domains are significantly different. The problem is to learn a predictor for the target domain to predict the structured outputs from the input. Due to the limited number of outputs available for the samples form the target domain, it is difficult to directly learn the predictor from the target domain, thus it is necessary to use the output information available in source domain. We propose to learn the target domain predictor by adapting a auxiliary predictor trained by using source domain data to the target domain. The adaptation is implemented by adding a delta function on the basis of the auxiliary predictor. An algorithm is developed to learn the parameter of the delta function to minimize loss functions associat- ed with the predicted outputs against the true outputs of the data samples with available outputs of the target domain."}
{"text": "  Much of the energy consumption in buildings is due to HVAC systems, which has motivated several recent studies on making these systems more energy- efficient. Occupancy and activity are two important aspects, which need to be correctly estimated for optimal HVAC control. However, state-of-the-art methods to estimate occupancy and classify activity require infrastructure and/or wearable sensors which suffers from lower acceptability due to higher cost. Encouragingly, with the advancement of the smartphones, these are becoming more achievable. Most of the existing occupancy estimation tech- niques have the underlying assumption that the phone is always carried by its user. However, phones are often left at desk while attending meeting or other events, which generates estimation error for the existing phone based occupancy algorithms. Similarly, in the recent days the emerging theory of Sparse Random Classifier (SRC) has been applied for activity classification on smartphone, however, there are rooms to improve the on-phone process- ing. We propose a novel sensor fusion method which offers almost 100% accuracy for occupancy estimation. We also propose an activity classifica- tion algorithm, which offers similar accuracy as of the state-of-the-art SRC algorithms while offering 50% reduction in processing."}
{"text": "  Log-linear models are the popular workhorses of analyzing contingency tables. A log-linear parameterization of an interaction model can be more expressive than a direct parameterization based on probabilities, leading to a powerful way of defining restrictions derived from marginal, conditional and context-specific independence. However, parameter estimation is often simpler under a direct parameterization, provided that the model enjoys certain decomposability properties. Here we introduce a cyclical projection algorithm for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of log-linear parameters under an arbitrary context-specific graphical log-linear model, which needs not satisfy criteria of decomposability. We illustrate that lifting the restriction of decomposability makes the models more expressive, such that additional context-specific independencies embedded in real data can be identified. It is also shown how a context-specific graphical model can correspond to a non-hierarchical log-linear parameterization with a concise interpretation. This observation can pave way to further development of non-hierarchical log-linear models, which have been largely neglected due to their believed lack of interpretability."}
{"text": "  We present a novel, scalable and Bayesian approach to modelling the occurrence of pairs of symbols (i,j) drawn from a large vocabulary. Observed pairs are assumed to be generated by a simple popularity based selection process followed by censoring using a preference function.

State of the art results are presented on real-world movie viewing data."}

LogitBoost, BrownBoost and RobustBoost are boosting algorithms claimed to be less sensitive to noise than AdaBoost. We present the results of experiments evaluating these algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. We compare the performance on each of datasets when the labels are corrupted by different levels of independent label noise. In presence of random label noise, we found that BrownBoost and RobustBoost perform significantly better than AdaBoost and LogitBoost, while the difference between each pair of algorithms is insignificant. We provide an explanation for the difference based on the margin distributions of the algorithms."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose to learn a Mahalanobis distance to perform alignment of multivariate time series. The learning examples for this task are time series for which the true alignment is known. We cast the alignment problem as a structured prediction task, and propose realistic losses between alignments for which the optimization is tractable. We provide experiments on real data in the audio to audio context, where we show that the learning of a similarity measure leads to improvements in the performance of the alignment task. We also propose to use this metric learning framework to perform feature selection and, from basic audio features, build a combination of these with better performance for the alignment."}
{"text": "  A particularly successful role for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is as a tool for discovering useful relational features for subsequent use in a predictive model. Conceptually, the case for using ILP to construct relational features rests on treating these features as functions, the automated discovery of which necessarily requires some form of first-order learning. Practically, there are now several reports in the literature that suggest that augmenting any existing features with ILP-discovered relational features can substantially improve the predictive power of a model. While the approach is straightforward enough, much still needs to be done to scale it up to explore more fully the space of possible features that can be constructed by an ILP system. This is in principle, infinite and in practice, extremely large. Applications have been confined to heuristic or random selections from this space. In this paper, we address this computational difficulty by allowing features to be constructed in a distributed manner. That is, there is a network of computational units, each of which employs an ILP engine to construct some small number of features and then builds a (local) model. We then employ a consensus-based algorithm, in which neighboring nodes share information to update local models. For a category of models (those with convex loss functions), it can be shown that the algorithm will result in all nodes converging to a consensus model. In practice, it may be slow to achieve this convergence. Nevertheless, our results on synthetic and real datasets that suggests that in relatively short time the \"best\" node in the network reaches a model whose predictive accuracy is comparable to that obtained using more computational effort in a non-distributed setting (the best node is identified as the one whose weights converge first)."}
{"text": "  This paper studies ordered weighted L1 (OWL) norm regularization for sparse estimation problems with strongly correlated variables. We prove sufficient conditions for clustering based on the correlation/colinearity of variables using the OWL norm, of which the so-called OSCAR is a particular case. Our results extend previous ones for OSCAR in several ways: for the squared error loss, our conditions hold for the more general OWL norm and under weaker assumptions; we also establish clustering conditions for the absolute error loss, which is, as far as we know, a novel result. Furthermore, we characterize the statistical performance of OWL norm regularization for generative models in which certain clusters of regression variables are strongly (even perfectly) correlated, but variables in different clusters are uncorrelated. We show that if the true p-dimensional signal generating the data involves only s of the clusters, then O(s log p) samples suffice to accurately estimate the signal, regardless of the number of coefficients within the clusters. The estimation of s-sparse signals with completely independent variables requires just as many measurements. In other words, using the OWL we pay no price (in terms of the number of measurements) for the presence of strongly correlated variables."}
{"text": "  In practical Bayesian optimization, we must often search over structures with differing numbers of parameters. For instance, we may wish to search over neural network architectures with an unknown number of layers. To relate performance data gathered for different architectures, we define a new kernel for conditional parameter spaces that explicitly includes information about which parameters are relevant in a given structure. We show that this kernel improves model quality and Bayesian optimization results over several simpler baseline kernels."}
{"text": "  Network metrics form a fundamental part of the network analysis toolbox. Used to quantitatively measure different aspects of the network, these metrics can give insights into the underlying network structure and function. In this work, we connect network metrics to modern probabilistic machine learning. We focus on the centrality metric, which is used a wide variety of applications from web search to gene-analysis. First, we formulate an eigenvector-based Bayesian centrality model for determining node importance. Compared to existing methods, our probabilistic model allows for the assimilation of multiple edge weight observations, the inclusion of priors and the extraction of uncertainties. To enable tractable inference, we develop a variational lower bound (VBC) that is demonstrated to be effective on a variety of networks (two synthetic and five real-world graphs). We then bridge this model to sparse Gaussian processes. The sparse variational Bayesian centrality Gaussian process (VBC-GP) learns a mapping between node attributes to latent centrality and hence, is capable of predicting centralities from node features and can potentially represent a large number of nodes using only a limited number of inducing inputs. Experiments show that the VBC-GP learns high-quality mappings and compares favorably to a two-step baseline, i.e., a full GP trained on the node attributes and pre-computed centralities. Finally, we present two case-studies using the VBC-GP: first, to ascertain relevant features in a taxi transport network and second, to distribute a limited number of vaccines to mitigate the severity of a viral outbreak."}
{"text": "  This work focuses on active learning of distance metrics from relative comparison information. A relative comparison specifies, for a data point triplet $(x_i,x_j,x_k)$, that instance $x_i$ is more similar to $x_j$ than to $x_k$. Such constraints, when available, have been shown to be useful toward defining appropriate distance metrics. In real-world applications, acquiring constraints often require considerable human effort. This motivates us to study how to select and query the most useful relative comparisons to achieve effective metric learning with minimum user effort. Given an underlying class concept that is employed by the user to provide such constraints, we present an information-theoretic criterion that selects the triplet whose answer leads to the highest expected gain in information about the classes of a set of examples. Directly applying the proposed criterion requires examining $O(n^3)$ triplets with $n$ instances, which is prohibitive even for datasets of moderate size. We show that a randomized selection strategy can be used to reduce the selection pool from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$, allowing us to scale up to larger-size problems. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms two baseline policies."}
{"text": "  We are interested in learning causal relationships between pairs of random variables, purely from observational data. To effectively address this task, the state-of-the-art relies on strong assumptions regarding the mechanisms mapping causes to effects, such as invertibility or the existence of additive noise, which only hold in limited situations. On the contrary, this short paper proposes to learn how to perform causal inference directly from data, and without the need of feature engineering. In particular, we pose causality as a kernel mean embedding classification problem, where inputs are samples from arbitrary probability distributions on pairs of random variables, and labels are types of causal relationships. We validate the performance of our method on synthetic and real-world data against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we submitted our algorithm to the ChaLearn's \"Fast Causation Coefficient Challenge\" competition, with which we won the fastest code prize and ranked third in the overall leaderboard."}
{"text": "  We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for a type of asymmetry between causes and effects that is present when these are related via linear models contaminated with additive non-Gaussian noise. Assuming that the causes and the effects have the same distribution, we show that the distribution of the residuals of a linear fit in the anti-causal direction is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of the residuals in the causal direction. This Gaussianization effect is characterized by reduction of the magnitude of the high-order cumulants and by an increment of the differential entropy of the residuals. The problem of non-linear causal inference is addressed by performing an embedding in an expanded feature space, in which the relation between causes and effects can be assumed to be linear. The effectiveness of a method to discriminate between causes and effects based on this type of asymmetry is illustrated in a variety of experiments using different measures of Gaussianity. The proposed method is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art techniques for causal inference."}
{"text": "  We develop a novel probabilistic approach for multi-label classification that is based on the mixtures-of-experts architecture combined with recently introduced conditional tree-structured Bayesian networks. Our approach captures different input-output relations from multi-label data using the efficient tree-structured classifiers, while the mixtures-of-experts architecture aims to compensate for the tree-structured restrictions and build a more accurate model. We develop and present algorithms for learning the model from data and for performing multi-label predictions on future data instances. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves highly competitive results and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods."}

This paper presents a set of experiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to build models to predict the day of the week given the weather data for that particular day i.e. temperature, wind, rain etc., and test their reliability across four cities in Australia {Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart}.

{"text": "  We consider the approximation capability of orthogonal super greedy algorithms (OSGA) and its applications in supervised learning. OSGA is concerned with selecting more than one atoms in each iteration step, which, of course, greatly reduces the computational burden when compared with the conventional orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA). We prove that even for function classes that are not the convex hull of the dictionary, OSGA does not degrade the approximation capability of OGA provided the dictionary is incoherent. Based on this, we deduce a tight generalization error bound for OSGA learning. Our results show that in the realm of supervised learning, OSGA provides a possibility to further reduce the computational burden of OGA in the premise of maintaining its prominent generalization capability."}
{"text": "  We consider \\textit{anytime} linear prediction in the common machine learning setting, where features are in groups that have costs. We achieve anytime (or interruptible) predictions by sequencing the computation of feature groups and reporting results using the computed features at interruption. We extend Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Forward Regression (FR) to learn the sequencing greedily under this group setting with costs. We theoretically guarantee that our algorithms achieve near-optimal linear predictions at each budget when a feature group is chosen. With a novel analysis of OMP, we improve its theoretical bound to the same strength as that of FR. In addition, we develop a novel algorithm that consumes cost $4B$ to approximate the optimal performance of \\textit{any} cost $B$, and prove that with cost less than $4B$, such an approximation is impossible. To our knowledge, these are the first anytime bounds at \\textit{all} budgets. We test our algorithms on two real-world data-sets and evaluate them in terms of anytime linear prediction performance against cost-weighted Group Lasso and alternative greedy algorithms."}
{"text": "  Subspace clustering (SC) is a promising clustering technology to identify clusters based on their associations with subspaces in high dimensional spaces. SC can be classified into hard subspace clustering (HSC) and soft subspace clustering (SSC). While HSC algorithms have been extensively studied and well accepted by the scientific community, SSC algorithms are relatively new but gaining more attention in recent years due to better adaptability. In the paper, a comprehensive survey on existing SSC algorithms and the recent development are presented. The SSC algorithms are classified systematically into three main categories, namely, conventional SSC (CSSC), independent SSC (ISSC) and extended SSC (XSSC). The characteristics of these algorithms are highlighted and the potential future development of SSC is also discussed."}
{"text": "  The traditional prototype based clustering methods, such as the well-known fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm, usually need sufficient data to find a good clustering partition. If the available data is limited or scarce, most of the existing prototype based clustering algorithms will no longer be effective. While the data for the current clustering task may be scarce, there is usually some useful knowledge available in the related scenes/domains. In this study, the concept of transfer learning is applied to prototype based fuzzy clustering (PFC). Specifically, the idea of leveraging knowledge from the source domain is exploited to develop a set of transfer prototype based fuzzy clustering (TPFC) algorithms. Three prototype based fuzzy clustering algorithms, namely, FCM, fuzzy k-plane clustering (FKPC) and fuzzy subspace clustering (FSC), have been chosen to incorporate with knowledge leveraging mechanism to develop the corresponding transfer clustering algorithms. Novel objective functions are proposed to integrate the knowledge of source domain with the data of target domain for clustering in the target domain. The proposed algorithms have been validated on different synthetic and real-world datasets and the results demonstrate their effectiveness when compared with both the original prototype based fuzzy clustering algorithms and the related clustering algorithms like multi-task clustering and co-clustering."}

More specifically, this model is designed to succeed even where the logit transform of the dependent variable is not necessarily linear in the independent variables. This research shows that for large datasets, the resulting models can be produced on modern computers in a tractable amount of time. These models are also resistant to overfitting, and as such they tend to produce interpretable models with only a limited number of features, all of which are designed to be well behaved."}

We characterize the complexity of the problem and introduce sample allocation strategies that pull arms to identify the best arm with a fixed confidence, while minimizing the sample budget. In particular, we show the importance of exploiting the global linear structure to improve the estimate of the reward of near-optimal arms. We analyze the proposed strategies and compare their empirical performance.

{"text": "  Variational inference is a powerful concept that underlies many iterative approximation algorithms; expectation propagation, mean-field methods and belief propagations were all central themes at the school that can be perceived from this unifying framework.

Corrections by expansion about the expectation propagation are then explained. Finally some advanced inference topics and applications are explored in the final sections."}
{"text": "  Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography are the only methods to measure the structure of the white matter in the living human brain. The diffusion signal has been modelled as the combined contribution from many individual fascicles of nerve fibers passing through each location in the white matter. Typically, this is done via basis pursuit, but estimation of the exact directions is limited due to discretization. The difficulties inherent in modeling DWI data are shared by many other problems involving fitting non-parametric mixture models. Ekanadaham et al. proposed an approach, continuous basis pursuit, to overcome discretization error in the 1-dimensional case (e.g., spike-sorting). Here, we propose a more general algorithm that fits mixture models of any dimensionality without discretization. Our algorithm uses the principles of L2-boost, together with refitting of the weights and pruning of the parameters. The addition of these steps to L2-boost both accelerates the algorithm and assures its accuracy. We refer to the resulting algorithm as elastic basis pursuit, or EBP, since it expands and contracts the active set of kernels as needed. We show that in contrast to existing approaches to fitting mixtures, our boosting framework (1) enables the selection of the optimal bias-variance tradeoff along the solution path, and (2) scales with high-dimensional problems. In simulations of DWI, we find that EBP yields better parameter estimates than a non-negative least squares (NNLS) approach, or the standard model used in DWI, the tensor model, which serves as the basis for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We demonstrate the utility of the method in DWI data acquired in parts of the brain containing crossings of multiple fascicles of nerve fibers."}
{"text": "  Significant attention has been given to minimizing a penalized least squares criterion for estimating sparse solutions to large linear systems of equations. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity and the natural choice is the so-called $l_0$ norm.

{"text": "  Feature subset selection, as a special case of the general subset selection problem, has been the topic of a considerable number of studies due to the growing importance of data-mining applications. In the feature subset selection problem there are two main issues that need to be addressed: (i) Finding an appropriate measure function than can be fairly fast and robustly computed for high-dimensional data. (ii) A search strategy to optimize the measure over the subset space in a reasonable amount of time. In this article mutual information between features and class labels is considered to be the measure function. Two series expansions for mutual information are proposed, and it is shown that most heuristic criteria suggested in the literature are truncated approximations of these expansions. It is well-known that searching the whole subset space is an NP-hard problem. Here, instead of the conventional sequential search algorithms, we suggest a parallel search strategy based on semidefinite programming (SDP) that can search through the subset space in polynomial time. By exploiting the similarities between the proposed algorithm and an instance of the maximum-cut problem in graph theory, the approximation ratio of this algorithm is derived and is compared with the approximation ratio of the backward elimination method. The experiments show that it can be misleading to judge the quality of a measure solely based on the classification accuracy, without taking the effect of the non-optimum search strategy into account."}
{"text": "  In this paper, a novel pattern classification approach is proposed by regularizing the classifier learning to maximize mutual information between the classification response and the true class label. We argue that, with the learned classifier, the uncertainty of the true class label of a data sample should be reduced by knowing its classification response as much as possible. The reduced uncertainty is measured by the mutual information between the classification response and the true class label. To this end, when learning a linear classifier, we propose to maximize the mutual information between classification responses and true class labels of training samples, besides minimizing the classification error and reduc- ing the classifier complexity. An objective function is constructed by modeling mutual information with entropy estimation, and it is optimized by a gradi- ent descend method in an iterative algorithm. Experiments on two real world pattern classification problems show the significant improvements achieved by maximum mutual information regularization."}
{"text": "  In cognitive radio (CR) technology, the trend of sensing is no longer to only detect the presence of active primary users. A large number of applications demand for more comprehensive knowledge on primary user behaviors in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. To satisfy such requirements, we study the statistical relationship among primary users by introducing a Bayesian network (BN) based framework. How to learn such a BN structure is a long standing issue, not fully understood even in the statistical learning community. Besides, another key problem in this learning scenario is that the CR has to identify how many variables are in the BN, which is usually considered as prior knowledge in statistical learning applications. To solve such two issues simultaneously, this paper proposes a BN structure learning scheme consisting of an efficient structure learning algorithm and a blind variable identification scheme. The proposed approach incurs significantly lower computational complexity compared with previous ones, and is capable of determining the structure without assuming much prior knowledge about variables. With this result, cognitive users could efficiently understand the statistical pattern of primary networks, such that more efficient cognitive protocols could be designed across different network layers."}
{"text": "  Kernel-based approaches for sequence classification have been successfully applied to a variety of domains, including the text categorization, image classification, speech analysis, biological sequence analysis, time series and music classification, where they show some of the most accurate results.   Typical kernel functions for sequences in these domains (e.g., bag-of-words, mismatch, or subsequence kernels) are restricted to {\\em discrete univariate} (i.e. one-dimensional) string data, such as sequences of words in the text analysis, codeword sequences in the image analysis, or nucleotide or amino acid sequences in the DNA and protein sequence analysis. However, original sequence data are often of real-valued multivariate nature, i.e. are not univariate and discrete as required by typical $k$-mer based sequence kernel functions.   In this work, we consider the problem of the {\\em multivariate} sequence classification such as classification of multivariate music sequences, or multidimensional protein sequence representations. To this end, we extend {\\em univariate} kernel functions typically used in sequence analysis and propose efficient {\\em multivariate} similarity kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a direct feature quantization (DFQ) of each sequence dimension in the original {\\em real-valued} multivariate sequences and (2) applying novel multivariate discrete kernel measures on these multivariate discrete DFQ sequence representations to more accurately capture similarity relationships among sequences and improve classification performance.   Experiments using the proposed MVDFQ-SK kernel method show excellent classification performance on three challenging music classification tasks as well as protein sequence classification with significant 25-40% improvements over univariate kernel methods and existing state-of-the-art sequence classification methods."}
{"text": "  Principal Components Analysis is a widely used technique for dimension reduction and characterization of variability in multivariate populations. Our interest lies in studying when and why the rotation to principal components can be used effectively within a response-predictor set relationship in the context of mode hunting. Specifically focusing on the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM), we first develop a fast version of this algorithm (fastPRIM) under normality which facilitates the theoretical studies to follow. Using basic geometrical arguments, we then demonstrate how the PC rotation of the predictor space alone can in fact generate improved mode estimators. Simulation results are used to illustrate our findings."}
{"text": "  This paper introduces a linear state-space model with time-varying dynamics. The time dependency is obtained by forming the state dynamics matrix as a time-varying linear combination of a set of matrices. The time dependency of the weights in the linear combination is modelled by another linear Gaussian dynamical model allowing the model to learn how the dynamics of the process changes. Previous approaches have used switching models which have a small set of possible state dynamics matrices and the model selects one of those matrices at each time, thus jumping between them. Our model forms the dynamics as a linear combination and the changes can be smooth and more continuous. The model is motivated by physical processes which are described by linear partial differential equations whose parameters vary in time. An example of such a process could be a temperature field whose evolution is driven by a varying wind direction. The posterior inference is performed using variational Bayesian approximation. The experiments on stochastic advection-diffusion processes and real-world weather processes show that the model with time-varying dynamics can outperform previously introduced approaches."}
{"text": "  The Volterra series can be used to model a large subset of nonlinear, dynamic systems. A major drawback is the number of coefficients required model such systems. In order to reduce the number of required coefficients, Laguerre polynomials are used to estimate the Volterra kernels.

This paper presents a novel algorithm for generalized calculation of the finite order Volterra-Laguerre (VL) series for a MIMO system. An example addresses the utility of the algorithm in practical application."}
{"text": "  In recent years rank aggregation has received significant attention from the machine learning community. The goal of such a problem is to combine the (partially revealed) preferences over objects of a large population into a single, relatively consistent ordering of those objects. However, in many cases, we might not want a single ranking and instead opt for individual rankings. We study a version of the problem known as collaborative ranking. In this problem we assume that individual users provide us with pairwise preferences (for example purchasing one item over another). From those preferences we wish to obtain rankings on items that the users have not had an opportunity to explore. The results here have a very interesting connection to the standard matrix completion problem. We provide a theoretical justification for a nuclear norm regularized optimization procedure, and provide high-dimensional scaling results that show how the error in estimating user preferences behaves as the number of observations increase."}
{"text": "  We consider a setting where a system learns to rank a fixed set of $m$ items. The goal is produce good item rankings for users with diverse interests who interact online with the system for $T$ rounds. We consider a novel top-$1$ feedback model: at the end of each round, the relevance score for only the top ranked object is revealed. However, the performance of the system is judged on the entire ranked list. We provide a comprehensive set of results regarding learnability under this challenging setting. For PairwiseLoss and DCG, two popular ranking measures, we prove that the minimax regret is $\\Theta(T^{2/3})$. Moreover, the minimax regret is achievable using an efficient strategy that only spends $O(m \\log m)$ time per round. The same efficient strategy achieves $O(T^{2/3})$ regret for Precision@$k$. Surprisingly, we show that for normalized versions of these ranking measures, i.e., AUC, NDCG \\& MAP, no online ranking algorithm can have sublinear regret."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel graphical model selection (GMS) scheme for high-dimensional stationary time series or discrete time process. The method is based on a natural generalization of the graphical LASSO (gLASSO), introduced originally for GMS based on i.i.d. samples, and estimates the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a time series from a finite length observation. The gLASSO for time series is defined as the solution of an l1-regularized maximum (approximate) likelihood problem. We solve this optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our approach is nonparametric as we do not assume a finite dimensional (e.g., an autoregressive) parametric model for the observed process. Instead, we require the process to be sufficiently smooth in the spectral domain. For Gaussian processes, we characterize the performance of our method theoretically by deriving an upper bound on the probability that our algorithm fails to correctly identify the CIG. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the correct CIG from a limited amount of samples."}
{"text": "  Stochastic discriminative EM (sdEM) is an online-EM-type algorithm for discriminative training of probabilistic generative models belonging to the exponential family. In this work, we introduce and justify this algorithm as a stochastic natural gradient descent method, i.e. a method which accounts for the information geometry in the parameter space of the statistical model. We show how this learning algorithm can be used to train probabilistic generative models by minimizing different discriminative loss functions, such as the negative conditional log-likelihood and the Hinge loss. The resulting models trained by sdEM are always generative (i.e. they define a joint probability distribution) and, in consequence, allows to deal with missing data and latent variables in a principled way either when being learned or when making predictions. The performance of this method is illustrated by several text classification problems for which a multinomial naive Bayes and a latent Dirichlet allocation based classifier are learned using different discriminative loss functions."}

NMF,whichtriestorepresentanonnegativedatamatrixasaproductoftwolowrank nonnegative matrices, has been a popular method for data representation due to its ability to explore the latent part-based structure of data. Recent study shows that lots of data distributions have manifold structures, and we should respect the manifold structure when the data are represented. Recently, manifold regularized NMF used a nearest neighbor graph to regulate the learning of factorization parameter matrices and has shown its advantage over traditional NMF methods for data representation problems. However, how to construct an optimal graph to present the manifold prop- erly remains a difficultproblem due to the graph modelselection, noisy features, and nonlinear distributed data. In this chapter, we introduce three effective methods to solve these problems of graph construction for manifold regularized NMF. Multiple graph learning is proposed to solve the problem of graph model selection, adaptive graph learning via feature selection is proposed to solve the problem of constructing a graph from noisy features, while multi-kernel learning-based graph construction is used to solve the problem of learning a graph from nonlinearly distributed data."}
{"text": "  Distributed learning of probabilistic models from multiple data repositories with minimum communication is increasingly important. We study a simple communication-efficient learning framework that first calculates the local maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based on the data subsets, and then combines the local MLEs to achieve the best possible approximation to the global MLE given the whole dataset. We study this framework's statistical properties, showing that the efficiency loss compared to the global setting relates to how much the underlying distribution families deviate from full exponential families, drawing connection to the theory of information loss by Fisher, Rao and Efron. We show that the \"full-exponential-family-ness\" represents the lower bound of the error rate of arbitrary combinations of local MLEs, and is achieved by a KL-divergence-based combination method but not by a more common linear combination method. We also study the empirical properties of both methods, showing that the KL method significantly outperforms linear combination in practical settings with issues such as model misspecification, non-convexity, and heterogeneous data partitions."}
{"text": "  We study prediction and estimation problems using empirical risk minimization, relative to a general convex loss function. We obtain sharp error rates even when concentration is false or is very restricted, for example, in heavy-tailed scenarios. Our results show that the error rate depends on two parameters: one captures the intrinsic complexity of the class, and essentially leads to the error rate in a noise-free (or realizable) problem; the other measures interactions between class members the target and the loss, and is dominant when the problem is far from realizable. We also explain how one may deal with outliers by choosing the loss in a way that is calibrated to the intrinsic complexity of the class and to the noise-level of the problem (the latter is measured by the distance between the target and the class)."}
{"text": "  We consider the task of fitting a regression model involving interactions among a potentially large set of covariates, in which we wish to enforce strong heredity. We propose FAMILY, a very general framework for this task. Our proposal is a generalization of several existing methods, such as VANISH [Radchenko and James, 2010], hierNet [Bien et al., 2013], the all-pairs lasso, and the lasso using only main effects. It can be formulated as the solution to a convex optimization problem, which we solve using an efficient alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This algorithm has guaranteed convergence to the global optimum, can be easily specialized to any convex penalty function of interest, and allows for a straightforward extension to the setting of generalized linear models. We derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom of FAMILY, and explore its performance in a simulation study and on an HIV sequence data set."}
{"text": "  Conditional random fields (CRFs) are usually specified by graphical models but in this paper we propose to use probabilistic logic programs and specify them generatively. Our intension is first to provide a unified approach to CRFs for complex modeling through the use of a Turing complete language and second to offer a convenient way of realizing generative-discriminative pairs in machine learning to compare generative and discriminative models and choose the best model. We implemented our approach as the D-PRISM language by modifying PRISM, a logic-based probabilistic modeling language for generative modeling, while exploiting its dynamic programming mechanism for efficient probability computation. We tested D-PRISM with logistic regression, a linear-chain CRF and a CRF-CFG and empirically confirmed their excellent discriminative performance compared to their generative counterparts, i.e.\\ naive Bayes, an HMM and a PCFG. We also introduced new CRF models, CRF-BNCs and CRF-LCGs. They are CRF versions of Bayesian network classifiers and probabilistic left-corner grammars respectively and easily implementable in D-PRISM. We empirically showed that they outperform their generative counterparts as expected."}
{"text": "  Sparse-Group Lasso (SGL) has been shown to be a powerful regression technique for simultaneously discovering group and within-group sparse patterns by using a combination of the $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms. However, in large-scale applications, the complexity of the regularizers entails great computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Layer Feature REduction method (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The two-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the inactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the sparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing feature reduction methods are only applicable for sparse models with one sparsity-inducing regularizer. To our best knowledge, TLFre is the first one that is capable of dealing with multiple sparsity-inducing regularizers. Moreover, TLFre has a very low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers. We also develop a screening method---called DPC (DecomPosition of Convex set)---for the nonnegative Lasso problem. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that TLFre and DPC improve the efficiency of SGL and nonnegative Lasso by several orders of magnitude."}
{"text": "  The capacity of a learning machine is measured by its Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, and learning machines with a low VC dimension generalize better. It is well known that the VC dimension of SVMs can be very large or unbounded, even though they generally yield state-of-the-art learning performance. In this paper, we show how to learn a hyperplane regressor by minimizing an exact, or \\boldmath{$\\Theta$} bound on its VC dimension. The proposed approach, termed as the Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) Regressor, involves solving a simple linear programming problem. Experimental results show, that on a number of benchmark datasets, the proposed approach yields regressors with error rates much less than those obtained with conventional SVM regresssors, while often using fewer support vectors. On some benchmark datasets, the number of support vectors is less than one tenth the number used by SVMs, indicating that the MCM does indeed learn simpler representations."}

{"text": "  The classical approach to inverse problems is based on the optimization of a misfit function. Despite its computational appeal, such an approach suffers from many shortcomings, e.g., non-uniqueness of solutions, modeling prior knowledge, etc. The Bayesian formalism to inverse problems avoids most of the difficulties encountered by the optimization approach, albeit at an increased computational cost. In this work, we use information theoretic arguments to cast the Bayesian inference problem in terms of an optimization problem. The resulting scheme combines the theoretical soundness of fully Bayesian inference with the computational efficiency of a simple optimization."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we describe a new vector similarity measure associated with a convex cost function. Given two vectors, we determine the surface normals of the convex function at the vectors. The angle between the two surface normals is the similarity measure. Convex cost function can be the negative entropy function, total variation (TV) function and filtered variation function. The convex cost function need not be differentiable everywhere. In general, we need to compute the gradient of the cost function to compute the surface normals. If the gradient does not exist at a given vector, it is possible to use the subgradients and the normal producing the smallest angle between the two vectors is used to compute the similarity measure."}
{"text": "  We are focusing on bound constrained global optimization problems, whose objective functions are computationally expensive black-box functions and have multiple local minima.

Specifically, we propose a new way to generate the candidate points which the next function evaluation point is picked from according to the metric criteria, based on a new definition of distance, and prove the global convergence of the corresponding. Correspondingly, a more adaptive implementation of MSRS, named \"SO-SA\", is presented. \"SO-SA\" is is more likely to perturb those most sensitive coordinates when generating the candidate points, instead of perturbing all coordinates simultaneously.   Numerical experiments on both synthetic problems and real problems demonstrate the advantages of our new algorithm, compared with many state of the art alternatives.}"}
{"text": "  We introduce the Locally Linear Latent Variable Model (LL-LVM), a probabilistic model for non-linear manifold discovery that describes a joint distribution over observations, their manifold coordinates and locally linear maps conditioned on a set of neighbourhood relationships. The model allows straightforward variational optimisation of the posterior distribution on coordinates and locally linear maps from the latent space to the observation space given the data. Thus, the LL-LVM encapsulates the local-geometry preserving intuitions that underlie non-probabilistic methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE). Its probabilistic semantics make it easy to evaluate the quality of hypothesised neighbourhood relationships, select the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold, construct out-of-sample extensions and to combine the manifold model with additional probabilistic models that capture the structure of coordinates within the manifold."}

We propose an MCMC sampler and show that our model is faster, more accurate and generates less correlated samples than competing models on both synthetic and real-life data. Finally, we show that our model easily handles data sizes not considered thus far by alternate approaches."}

However, $L_1$ regularization typically selects too many features and that so-called false positives are unavoidable. In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze an aggregation method for sparse logistic regression in high dimensions. This approach linearly combines the estimators from a suitable set of logistic models with different underlying sparsity patterns and can balance the predictive ability and model interpretability. Numerical performance of our proposed aggregation method is then investigated using simulation studies. We also analyze a published genome-wide case-control dataset to further evaluate the usefulness of the aggregation method in multilocus association mapping."}
{"text": "  We consider supervised learning with random decision trees, where the tree construction is completely random. The method is popularly used and works well in practice despite the simplicity of the setting, but its statistical mechanism is not yet well-understood. In this paper we provide strong theoretical guarantees regarding learning with random decision trees. We analyze and compare three different variants of the algorithm that have minimal memory requirements: majority voting, threshold averaging and probabilistic averaging. The random structure of the tree enables us to adapt these methods to a differentially-private setting thus we also propose differentially-private versions of all three schemes. We give upper-bounds on the generalization error and mathematically explain how the accuracy depends on the number of random decision trees. Furthermore, we prove that only logarithmic (in the size of the dataset) number of independently selected random decision trees suffice to correctly classify most of the data, even when differential-privacy guarantees must be maintained. We empirically show that majority voting and threshold averaging give the best accuracy, also for conservative users requiring high privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a simple majority voting rule is an especially good candidate for the differentially-private classifier since it is much less sensitive to the choice of forest parameters than other methods."}

(Kang 2013) recently proposed a novel use of determinantal point processes for sampling the initial centroids for the KMEANS algorithm (we call it KMEANSD++). They, however, do not provide any evaluation establishing that KMEANSD++ is better than other algorithms.

{"text": "  Portable, Wearable and Wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) Systems have the potential to be used as point-of-care for cardiovascular disease diagnostic systems. Such wearable and wireless ECG systems require automatic detection of cardiovascular disease. Even in the primary care, automation of ECG diagnostic systems will improve efficiency of ECG diagnosis and reduce the minimal training requirement of local healthcare workers. However, few fully automatic myocardial infarction (MI) disease detection algorithms have well been developed. This paper presents a novel automatic MI classification algorithm using second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with time varying coefficients, which simultaneously captures morphological and dynamic feature of highly correlated ECG signals. By effectively estimating the unobserved state variables and the parameters of the second order ODE, the accuracy of the classification was significantly improved. The estimated time varying coefficients of the second order ODE were used as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) for the MI classification. The proposed method was applied to the PTB diagnostic ECG database within Physionet. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy of 12 lead ECGs for MI binary classifications were 98.7%, 96.4% and 98.3%, respectively. We also found that even using one lead ECG signals, we can reach accuracy as high as 97%. Multiclass MI classification is a challenging task but the developed ODE approach for 12 lead ECGs coupled with multiclass SVM reached 96.4% accuracy for classifying 5 subgroups of MI and healthy controls."}
{"text": "  Realizations of stochastic process are often observed temporal data or functional data. There are growing interests in classification of dynamic or functional data. The basic feature of functional data is that the functional data have infinite dimensions and are highly correlated. An essential issue for classifying dynamic and functional data is how to effectively reduce their dimension and explore dynamic feature. However, few statistical methods for dynamic data classification have directly used rich dynamic features of the data. We propose to use second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) to model dynamic process and principal differential analysis to estimate constant or time-varying parameters in the ODE. We examine differential dynamic properties of the dynamic system across different conditions including stability and transient-response, which determine how the dynamic systems maintain their functions and performance under a broad range of random internal and external perturbations. We use the parameters in the ODE as features for classifiers. As a proof of principle, the proposed methods are applied to classifying normal and abnormal QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) data analysis, which is of great clinical values in diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. We show that the ODE-based classification methods in QRS complex classification outperform the currently widely used neural networks with Fourier expansion coefficients of the functional data as their features. We expect that the dynamic model-based classification methods may open a new avenue for functional data classification."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we focus on developing efficient sensitivity analysis methods for a computationally expensive objective function $f(x)$ in the case that the minimization of it has just been performed. Here \"computationally expensive\" means that each of its evaluation takes significant amount of time, and therefore our main goal to use a small number of function evaluations of $f(x)$ to further infer the sensitivity information of these different parameters. Correspondingly, we consider the optimization procedure as an adaptive experimental design and re-use its available function evaluations as the initial design points to establish a surrogate model $s(x)$ (or called response surface). The sensitivity analysis is performed on $s(x)$, which is an lieu of $f(x)$. Furthermore, we propose a new local multivariate sensitivity measure, for example, around the optimal solution, for high dimensional problems. Then a corresponding \"objective-oriented experimental design\" is proposed in order to make the generated surrogate $s(x)$ better suitable for the accurate calculation of the proposed specific local sensitivity quantities. In addition, we demonstrate the better performance of the Gaussian radial basis function interpolator over Kriging in our cases, which are of relatively high dimensionality and few experimental design points. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the optimization procedure and the \"objective-oriented experimental design\" behavior much better than the classical Latin Hypercube Design. In addition, the performance of Kriging is not as good as Gaussian RBF, especially in the case of high dimensional problems."}
{"text": "  In high-dimensional data, structured noise caused by observed and unobserved factors affecting multiple target variables simultaneously, imposes a serious challenge for modeling, by masking the often weak signal. Therefore, (1) explaining away the structured noise in multiple-output regression is of paramount importance. Additionally, (2) assumptions about the correlation structure of the regression weights are needed. We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the \\emph{latent signal-to-noise ratio} which turns out to be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite-dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational unidentifiability in reduced-rank regression models. Simulations and prediction experiments with metabolite, gene expression, FMRI measurement, and macroeconomic time series data show that our model equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance and, in particular, outperforms the standard approach of assuming independent noise and signal models."}
{"text": "  Advances of modern sensing and sequencing technologies generate a deluge of high dimensional space-temporal physiological and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Physiological traits are observed either as continuous random functions, or on a dense grid and referred to as function-valued traits. Both physiological and NGS data are highly correlated data with their inherent order, spacing, and functional nature which are ignored by traditional summary-based univariate and multivariate regression methods designed for quantitative genetic analysis of scalar trait and common variants. To capture morphological and dynamic features of the data and utilize their dependent structure, we propose a functional linear model (FLM) in which a trait curve is modeled as a response function, the genetic variation in a genomic region or gene is modeled as a functional predictor, and the genetic effects are modeled as a function of both time and genomic position (FLMF) for genetic analysis of function-valued trait with both GWAS and NGS data. By extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the FLMF has the correct type 1 error rates and much higher power to detect association than the existing methods. The FLMF is applied to sleep data from Starr County health studies where oxygen saturation were measured in 22,670 seconds on average for 833 individuals. We found 65 genes that were significantly associated with oxygen saturation functional trait with P-values ranging from 2.40E-06 to 2.53E-21. The results clearly demonstrate that the FLMF substantially outperforms the traditional genetic models with scalar trait."}
{"text": "  Feature selection involes identifying the most relevant subset of input features, with a view to improving generalization of predictive models by reducing overfitting. Directly searching for the most relevant combination of attributes is NP-hard. Variable selection is of critical importance in many applications, such as micro-array data analysis, where selecting a small number of discriminative features is crucial to developing useful models of disease mechanisms, as well as for prioritizing targets for drug discovery. The recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) provides a way to learn a hyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact (\\boldmath{$\\Theta$}) bound on its VC dimension. It is well known that a lower VC dimension contributes to good generalization. For a linear hyperplane classifier in the input space, the VC dimension is upper bounded by the number of features; hence, a linear classifier with a small VC dimension is parsimonious in the set of features it employs. In this paper, we use the linear MCM to learn a classifier in which a large number of weights are zero; features with non-zero weights are the ones that are chosen. Selected features are used to learn a kernel SVM classifier. On a number of benchmark datasets, the features chosen by the linear MCM yield comparable or better test set accuracy than when methods such as ReliefF and FCBF are used for the task. The linear MCM typically chooses one-tenth the number of attributes chosen by the other methods; on some very high dimensional datasets, the MCM chooses about $0.6\\%$ of the features; in comparison, ReliefF and FCBF choose 70 to 140 times more features, thus demonstrating that minimizing the VC dimension may provide a new, and very effective route for feature selection and for learning sparse representations."}
{"text": "  Motivated by large-scale Collaborative-Filtering applications, we present a Non-Commuting Latent Factor (NCLF) tensor-completion approach for modeling three-way arrays, which is diagonal like the standard PARAFAC, but wherein different terms distinguish different kinds of three-way relations of co-clusters, as determined by permutations of latent factors. The first key component of the algebraic representation is the usage of two non-commutative real trilinear operations as the building blocks of the approximation. These operations are the standard three dimensional triple-product and a trilinear product on a two-dimensional real vector space, which is a representation of the real Clifford Algebra Cl(1,1) (a certain Majorana spinor). Both operations are purely ternary in that they cannot be decomposed into two group-operations on the relevant spaces. The second key component of the method is combining these operations using permutation-symmetry preserving linear combinations. We apply the model to the MovieLens and Fannie Mae datasets, and find that it outperforms the PARAFAC model. We propose some future directions, such as unsupervised-learning."}
{"text": "  A Relational Dependency Network (RDN) is a directed graphical model widely used for multi-relational data. These networks allow cyclic dependencies, necessary to represent relational autocorrelations. We describe an approach for learning both the RDN's structure and its parameters, given an input relational database: First learn a Bayesian network (BN), then transform the Bayesian network to an RDN. Thus fast Bayes net learning can provide fast RDN learning. The BN-to-RDN transform comprises a simple, local adjustment of the Bayes net structure and a closed-form transform of the Bayes net parameters. This method can learn an RDN for a dataset with a million tuples in minutes. We empirically compare our approach to state-of-the art RDN learning methods that use functional gradient boosting, on five benchmark datasets. Learning RDNs via BNs scales much better to large datasets than learning RDNs with boosting, and provides competitive accuracy in predictions."}
{"text": "  Standard Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems assume that the arms are independent. However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained by playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence, in such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to enable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the Global MAB (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm with the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded parameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the optimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability one. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each other's rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the parameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the informativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk bound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for linearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative. GMABs have applications ranging from drug and treatment discovery to dynamic pricing."}
{"text": "  In this paper we introduce a new optimization formulation for sparse regression and compressed sensing, called CLOT (Combined L-One and Two), wherein the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\\ell_1$- and $\\ell_2$-norms. This formulation differs from the Elastic Net (EN) formulation, in which the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\\ell_1$- and $\\ell_2$-norm squared. It is shown that, in the context of compressed sensing, the EN formulation does not achieve robust recovery of sparse vectors, whereas the new CLOT formulation achieves robust recovery. Also, like EN but unlike LASSO, the CLOT formulation achieves the grouping effect, wherein coefficients of highly correlated columns of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned roughly comparable values. It is already known LASSO does not have the grouping effect. Therefore the CLOT formulation combines the best features of both LASSO (robust sparse recovery) and EN (grouping effect).   The CLOT formulation is a special case of another one called SGL (Sparse Group LASSO) which was introduced into the literature previously, but without any analysis of either the grouping effect or robust sparse recovery. It is shown here that SGL achieves robust sparse recovery, and also achieves a version of the grouping effect in that coefficients of highly correlated columns belonging to the same group of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned roughly comparable values."}
{"text": "  Estimating the parameters of probabilistic models of language such as maxent models and probabilistic neural models is computationally difficult since it involves evaluating partition functions by summing over an entire vocabulary, which may be millions of word types in size. Two closely related strategies---noise contrastive estimation (Mnih and Teh, 2012; Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Vaswani et al., 2013) and negative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2012; Goldberg and Levy, 2014)---have emerged as popular solutions to this computational problem, but some confusion remains as to which is more appropriate and when. This document explicates their relationships to each other and to other estimation techniques. The analysis shows that, although they are superficially similar, NCE is a general parameter estimation technique that is asymptotically unbiased, while negative sampling is best understood as a family of binary classification models that are useful for learning word representations but not as a general-purpose estimator."}
{"text": "  We give a comprehensive theoretical characterization of a nonparametric estimator for the $L_2^2$ divergence between two continuous distributions. We first bound the rate of convergence of our estimator, showing that it is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent provided the densities are sufficiently smooth. In this smooth regime, we then show that our estimator is asymptotically normal, construct asymptotic confidence intervals, and establish a Berry-Ess\\'{e}en style inequality characterizing the rate of convergence to normality. We also show that this estimator is minimax optimal."}
{"text": "  We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting."}
{"text": "  This work concerns learning probabilistic models for ranking data in a heterogeneous population. The specific problem we study is learning the parameters of a Mallows Mixture Model. Despite being widely studied, current heuristics for this problem do not have theoretical guarantees and can get stuck in bad local optima. We present the first polynomial time algorithm which provably learns the parameters of a mixture of two Mallows models. A key component of our algorithm is a novel use of tensor decomposition techniques to learn the top-k prefix in both the rankings. Before this work, even the question of identifiability in the case of a mixture of two Mallows models was unresolved."}
{"text": "  Motivated by generating personalized recommendations using ordinal (or preference) data, we study the question of learning a mixture of MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model, a parameterized class of distributions over permutations, from partial ordinal or preference data (e.g. pair-wise comparisons). Despite its long standing importance across disciplines including social choice, operations research and revenue management, little is known about this question. In case of single MNL models (no mixture), computationally and statistically tractable learning from pair-wise comparisons is feasible. However, even learning mixture with two MNL components is infeasible in general.   Given this state of affairs, we seek conditions under which it is feasible to learn the mixture model in both computationally and statistically efficient manner. We present a sufficient condition as well as an efficient algorithm for learning mixed MNL models from partial preferences/comparisons data. In particular, a mixture of $r$ MNL components over $n$ objects can be learnt using samples whose size scales polynomially in $n$ and $r$ (concretely, $r^{3.5}n^3(log n)^4$, with $r\\ll n^{2/7}$ when the model parameters are sufficiently incoherent). The algorithm has two phases: first, learn the pair-wise marginals for each component using tensor decomposition; second, learn the model parameters for each component using Rank Centrality introduced by Negahban et al. In the process of proving these results, we obtain a generalization of existing analysis for tensor decomposition to a more realistic regime where only partial information about each sample is available."}
{"text": "  We present the first fully variational Bayesian inference scheme for continuous Gaussian-process-modulated Poisson processes. Such point processes are used in a variety of domains, including neuroscience, geo-statistics and astronomy, but their use is hindered by the computational cost of existing inference schemes. Our scheme: requires no discretisation of the domain; scales linearly in the number of observed events; and is many orders of magnitude faster than previous sampling based approaches. The resulting algorithm is shown to outperform standard methods on synthetic examples, coal mining disaster data and in the prediction of Malaria incidences in Kenya."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel sampling framework for inference in probabilistic models: an active learning approach that converges more quickly (in wall-clock time) than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) benchmarks. The central challenge in probabilistic inference is numerical integration, to average over ensembles of models or unknown (hyper-)parameters (for example to compute the marginal likelihood or a partition function). MCMC has provided approaches to numerical integration that deliver state-of-the-art inference, but can suffer from sample inefficiency and poor convergence diagnostics. Bayesian quadrature techniques offer a model-based solution to such problems, but their uptake has been hindered by prohibitive computation costs. We introduce a warped model for probabilistic integrands (likelihoods) that are known to be non-negative, permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations. Our algorithm is demonstrated to offer faster convergence (in seconds) relative to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and real-world examples."}
{"text": "  We present Factorbird, a prototype of a parameter server approach for factorizing large matrices with Stochastic Gradient Descent-based algorithms. We designed Factorbird to meet the following desiderata: (a) scalability to tall and wide matrices with dozens of billions of non-zeros, (b) extensibility to different kinds of models and loss functions as long as they can be optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and (c) adaptability to both batch and streaming scenarios. Factorbird uses a parameter server in order to scale to models that exceed the memory of an individual machine, and employs lock-free Hogwild!-style learning with a special partitioning scheme to drastically reduce conflicting updates. We also discuss other aspects of the design of our system such as how to efficiently grid search for hyperparameters at scale. We present experiments of Factorbird on a matrix built from a subset of Twitter's interaction graph, consisting of more than 38 billion non-zeros and about 200 million rows and columns, which is to the best of our knowledge the largest matrix on which factorization results have been reported in the literature."}
{"text": "  We use statistical learning methods to construct an adaptive state estimator for nonlinear stochastic systems. Optimal state estimation, in the form of a Kalman filter, requires knowledge of the system's process and measurement uncertainty. We propose that these uncertainties can be estimated from (conditioned on) past observed data, and without making any assumptions of the system's prior distribution. The system's prior distribution at each time step is constructed from an ensemble of least-squares estimates on sub-sampled sets of the data via jackknife sampling. As new data is acquired, the state estimates, process uncertainty, and measurement uncertainty are updated accordingly, as described in this manuscript."}
{"text": "  CUR matrix decomposition computes the low rank approximation of a given matrix by using the actual rows and columns of the matrix. It has been a very useful tool for handling large matrices. One limitation with the existing algorithms for CUR matrix decomposition is that they need an access to the {\\it full} matrix, a requirement that can be difficult to fulfill in many real world applications. In this work, we alleviate this limitation by developing a CUR decomposition algorithm for partially observed matrices. In particular, the proposed algorithm computes the low rank approximation of the target matrix based on (i) the randomly sampled rows and columns, and (ii) a subset of observed entries that are randomly sampled from the matrix. Our analysis shows the relative error bound, measured by spectral norm, for the proposed algorithm when the target matrix is of full rank. We also show that only $O(n r\\ln r)$ observed entries are needed by the proposed algorithm to perfectly recover a rank $r$ matrix of size $n\\times n$, which improves the sample complexity of the existing algorithms for matrix completion. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets verify our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a ubiquitous, flexible Bayesian nonparametric statistical model. However, full probabilistic inference in this model is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques such as Gibb's sampling are required. As a result, DPM-based methods, which have considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which computational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they would not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware, where computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop simplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithms for DPMs. This algorithm is as simple as K-means clustering, performs in experiments as well as Gibb's sampling, while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort. Unlike related small variance asymptotics, our algorithm is non-degenerate and so inherits the \"rich get richer\" property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate closed-form likelihood which enables standard tools such as cross-validation to be used. This is a well-posed approximation to the MAP solution of the probabilistic DPM model."}
{"text": "  The Eigendecomposition of quadratic forms (symmetric matrices) guaranteed by the spectral theorem is a foundational result in applied mathematics. Motivated by a shared structure found in inferential problems of recent interest---namely orthogonal tensor decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), topic models, spectral clustering, and Gaussian mixture learning---we generalize the eigendecomposition from quadratic forms to a broad class of \"orthogonally decomposable\" functions. We identify a key role of convexity in our extension, and we generalize two traditional characterizations of eigenvectors: First, the eigenvectors of a quadratic form arise from the optima structure of the quadratic form on the sphere. Second, the eigenvectors are the fixed points of the power iteration.   In our setting, we consider a simple first order generalization of the power method which we call gradient iteration. It leads to efficient and easily implementable methods for basis recovery. It includes influential Machine Learning methods such as cumulant-based FastICA and the tensor power iteration for orthogonally decomposable tensors as special cases.   We provide a complete theoretical analysis of gradient iteration using the structure theory of discrete dynamical systems to show almost sure convergence and fast (super-linear) convergence rates. The analysis also extends to the case when the observed function is only approximately orthogonally decomposable, with bounds that are polynomial in dimension and other relevant parameters, such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be considered as a non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for perturbations of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices."}
{"text": "  We provide a general framework for computing lower-bounds on the sample complexity of recovering the underlying graphs of Ising models, given i.i.d samples. While there have been recent results for specific graph classes, these involve fairly extensive technical arguments that are specialized to each specific graph class. In contrast, we isolate two key graph-structural ingredients that can then be used to specify sample complexity lower-bounds. Presence of these structural properties makes the graph class hard to learn. We derive corollaries of our main result that not only recover existing recent results, but also provide lower bounds for novel graph classes not considered previously. We also extend our framework to the random graph setting and derive corollaries for Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi graphs in a certain dense setting."}
{"text": "  It has been a long-standing goal in machine learning, as well as in AI more generally, to develop life-long learning systems that learn many different tasks over time, and reuse insights from tasks learned, \"learning to learn\" as they do so. In this work we pose and provide efficient algorithms for several natural theoretical formulations of this goal. Specifically, we consider the problem of learning many different target functions over time, that share certain commonalities that are initially unknown to the learning algorithm. Our aim is to learn new internal representations as the algorithm learns new target functions, that capture this commonality and allow subsequent learning tasks to be solved more efficiently and from less data. We develop efficient algorithms for two very different kinds of commonalities that target functions might share: one based on learning common low-dimensional and unions of low-dimensional subspaces and one based on learning nonlinear Boolean combinations of features. Our algorithms for learning Boolean feature combinations additionally have a dual interpretation, and can be viewed as giving an efficient procedure for constructing near-optimal sparse Boolean autoencoders under a natural \"anchor-set\" assumption."}
{"text": "  This article contains detailed proofs and additional examples related to the UAI-2013 submission `Learning Sparse Causal Models is not NP-hard'. It describes the FCI+ algorithm: a method for sound and complete causal model discovery in the presence of latent confounders and/or selection bias, that has worst case polynomial complexity of order $N^{2(k+1)}$ in the number of independence tests, for sparse graphs over $N$ nodes, bounded by node degree $k$. The algorithm is an adaptation of the well-known FCI algorithm by (Spirtes et al., 2000) that is also sound and complete, but has worst case complexity exponential in $N$."}
{"text": "  We investigate the problem of incorporating higher-level symbolic score-like information into Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) systems to improve their performance. We use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants as music language models (MLMs) and present a generative architecture for combining these models with predictions from a frame level acoustic classifier. We also compare different neural network architectures for acoustic modeling. The proposed model computes a distribution over possible output sequences given the acoustic input signal and we present an algorithm for performing a global search for good candidate transcriptions. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on piano music from the MAPS dataset and we observe that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing transcription methods."}
{"text": "  Variational inference algorithms have proven successful for Bayesian analysis in large data settings, with recent advances using stochastic variational inference (SVI). However, such methods have largely been studied in independent or exchangeable data settings. We develop an SVI algorithm to learn the parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in a time-dependent data setting. The challenge in applying stochastic optimization in this setting arises from dependencies in the chain, which must be broken to consider minibatches of observations. We propose an algorithm that harnesses the memory decay of the chain to adaptively bound errors arising from edge effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic experiments and a large genomics dataset where a batch algorithm is computationally infeasible."}
{"text": "  Probabilistic programming languages can simplify the development of machine learning techniques, but only if inference is sufficiently scalable. Unfortunately, Bayesian parameter estimation for highly coupled models such as regressions and state-space models still scales poorly; each MCMC transition takes linear time in the number of observations. This paper describes a sublinear-time algorithm for making Metropolis-Hastings (MH) updates to latent variables in probabilistic programs. The approach generalizes recently introduced approximate MH techniques: instead of subsampling data items assumed to be independent, it subsamples edges in a dynamically constructed graphical model. It thus applies to a broader class of problems and interoperates with other general-purpose inference techniques. Empirical results, including confirmation of sublinear per-transition scaling, are presented for Bayesian logistic regression, nonlinear classification via joint Dirichlet process mixtures, and parameter estimation for stochastic volatility models (with state estimation via particle MCMC). All three applications use the same implementation, and each requires under 20 lines of probabilistic code."}
{"text": "  Gaussian process classification is a popular method with a number of appealing properties. We show how to scale the model within a variational inducing point framework, outperforming the state of the art on benchmark datasets. Importantly, the variational formulation can be exploited to allow classification in problems with millions of data points, as we demonstrate in experiments."}
{"text": "  A common phenomena in modern recommendation systems is the use of feedback from one user to infer the `value' of an item to other users. This results in an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value have to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value. Existing approaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items are small, or admit some underlying structure -- it is unclear, however, if good recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with unstructured content.   We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of items and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an `access-graph' constrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that the presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible -- however this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage of the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of `serendipity' in exploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of recommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple policies like Twitter's `Latest-First' policy achieve a good performance.   From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of `trials' and `strategies' are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the same order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for the worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon settings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph. Conversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly sub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal."}
{"text": "  This paper considers statistical estimation problems where the probability distribution of the observed random variable is invariant with respect to actions of a finite topological group. It is shown that any such distribution must satisfy a restricted finite mixture representation. When specialized to the case of distributions over the sphere that are invariant to the actions of a finite spherical symmetry group $\\mathcal G$, a group-invariant extension of the Von Mises Fisher (VMF) distribution is obtained. The $\\mathcal G$-invariant VMF is parameterized by location and scale parameters that specify the distribution's mean orientation and its concentration about the mean, respectively. Using the restricted finite mixture representation these parameters can be estimated using an Expectation Maximization (EM) maximum likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm. This is illustrated for the problem of mean crystal orientation estimation under the spherically symmetric group associated with the crystal form, e.g., cubic or octahedral or hexahedral. Simulations and experiments establish the advantages of the extended VMF EM-ML estimator for data acquired by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) microscopy of a polycrystalline Nickel alloy sample."}

{"text": "  Orthogonal greedy learning (OGL) is a stepwise learning scheme that adds a new atom from a dictionary via the steepest gradient descent and build the estimator via orthogonal projecting the target function to the space spanned by the selected atoms in each greedy step. Here, \"greed\" means choosing a new atom according to the steepest gradient descent principle. OGL then avoids the overfitting/underfitting by selecting an appropriate iteration number. In this paper, we point out that the overfitting/underfitting can also be avoided via redefining \"greed\" in OGL. To this end, we introduce a new greedy metric, called $\\delta$-greedy thresholds, to refine \"greed\" and theoretically verifies its feasibility. Furthermore, we reveals that such a greedy metric can bring an adaptive termination rule on the premise of maintaining the prominent learning performance of OGL. Our results show that the steepest gradient descent is not the unique greedy metric of OGL and some other more suitable metric may lessen the hassle of model-selection of OGL."}
{"text": "  Consider a stationary discrete random process with alphabet size d, which is assumed to be the output process of an unknown stationary Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Given the joint probabilities of finite length strings of the process, we are interested in finding a finite state generative model to describe the entire process. In particular, we focus on two classes of models: HMMs and quasi-HMMs, which is a strictly larger class of models containing HMMs. In the main theorem, we show that if the random process is generated by an HMM of order less or equal than k, and whose transition and observation probability matrix are in general position, namely almost everywhere on the parameter space, both the minimal quasi-HMM realization and the minimal HMM realization can be efficiently computed based on the joint probabilities of all the length N strings, for N > 4 lceil log_d(k) rceil +1. In this paper, we also aim to compare and connect the two lines of literature: realization theory of HMMs, and the recent development in learning latent variable models with tensor decomposition techniques."}
{"text": "  Classical stochastic gradient methods are well suited for minimizing expected-value objective functions. However, they do not apply to the minimization of a nonlinear function involving expected values or a composition of two expected-value functions, i.e., problems of the form $\\min_x \\mathbf{E}_v [f_v\\big(\\mathbf{E}_w [g_w(x)]\\big)]$. In order to solve this stochastic composition problem, we propose a class of stochastic compositional gradient descent (SCGD) algorithms that can be viewed as stochastic versions of quasi-gradient method. SCGD update the solutions based on noisy sample gradients of $f_v,g_{w}$ and use an auxiliary variable to track the unknown quantity $\\mathbf{E}_w[g_w(x)]$. We prove that the SCGD converge almost surely to an optimal solution for convex optimization problems, as long as such a solution exists. The convergence involves the interplay of two iterations with different time scales. For nonsmooth convex problems, the SCGD achieve a convergence rate of $O(k^{-1/4})$ in the general case and $O(k^{-2/3})$ in the strongly convex case, after taking $k$ samples. For smooth convex problems, the SCGD can be accelerated to converge at a rate of $O(k^{-2/7})$ in the general case and $O(k^{-4/5})$ in the strongly convex case. For nonconvex problems, we prove that any limit point generated by SCGD is a stationary point, for which we also provide the convergence rate analysis. Indeed, the stochastic setting where one wants to optimize compositions of expected-value functions is very common in practice. The proposed SCGD methods find wide applications in learning, estimation, dynamic programming, etc."}
{"text": "  Clinical trial adaptation refers to any adjustment of the trial protocol after the onset of the trial. The main goal is to make the process of introducing new medical interventions to patients more efficient by reducing the cost and the time associated with evaluating their safety and efficacy. The principal question is how should adaptation be performed so as to minimize the chance of distorting the outcome of the trial. We propose a novel method for achieving this. Unlike previous work our approach focuses on trial adaptation by sample size adjustment. We adopt a recently proposed stratification framework based on collected auxiliary data and show that this information together with the primary measured variables can be used to make a probabilistically informed choice of the particular sub-group a sample should be removed from. Experiments on simulated data are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our method and its application in practice."}
{"text": "  A widely applied approach to causal inference from a non-experimental time series $X$, often referred to as \"(linear) Granger causal analysis\", is to regress present on past and interpret the regression matrix $\\hat{B}$ causally. However, if there is an unmeasured time series $Z$ that influences $X$, then this approach can lead to wrong causal conclusions, i.e., distinct from those one would draw if one had additional information such as $Z$. In this paper we take a different approach: We assume that $X$ together with some hidden $Z$ forms a first order vector autoregressive (VAR) process with transition matrix $A$, and argue why it is more valid to interpret $A$ causally instead of $\\hat{B}$. Then we examine under which conditions the most important parts of $A$ are identifiable or almost identifiable from only $X$. Essentially, sufficient conditions are (1) non-Gaussian, independent noise or (2) no influence from $X$ to $Z$. We present two estimation algorithms that are tailored towards conditions (1) and (2), respectively, and evaluate them on synthetic and real-world data. We discuss how to check the model using $X$."}
{"text": "  While robust parameter estimation has been well studied in parametric density estimation, there has been little investigation into robust density estimation in the nonparametric setting. We present a robust version of the popular kernel density estimator (KDE). As with other estimators, a robust version of the KDE is useful since sample contamination is a common issue with datasets. What \"robustness\" means for a nonparametric density estimate is not straightforward and is a topic we explore in this paper. To construct a robust KDE we scale the traditional KDE and project it to its nearest weighted KDE in the $L^2$ norm. This yields a scaled and projected KDE (SPKDE). Because the squared $L^2$ norm penalizes point-wise errors superlinearly this causes the weighted KDE to allocate more weight to high density regions. We demonstrate the robustness of the SPKDE with numerical experiments and a consistency result which shows that asymptotically the SPKDE recovers the uncontaminated density under sufficient conditions on the contamination."}
{"text": "  In this article, we derive a new stepsize adaptation for the normalized least mean square algorithm (NLMS) by describing the task of linear acoustic echo cancellation from a Bayesian network perspective. Similar to the well-known Kalman filter equations, we model the acoustic wave propagation from the loudspeaker to the microphone by a latent state vector and define a linear observation equation (to model the relation between the state vector and the observation) as well as a linear process equation (to model the temporal progress of the state vector). Based on additional assumptions on the statistics of the random variables in observation and process equation, we apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to derive an NLMS-like filter adaptation. By exploiting the conditional independence rules for Bayesian networks, we reveal that the resulting EM-NLMS algorithm has a stepsize update equivalent to the optimal-stepsize calculation proposed by Yamamoto and Kitayama in 1982, which has been adopted in many textbooks. As main difference, the instantaneous stepsize value is estimated in the M step of the EM algorithm (instead of being approximated by artificially extending the acoustic echo path). The EM-NLMS algorithm is experimentally verified for synthesized scenarios with both, white noise and male speech as input signal."}
{"text": "  Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is the only method we currently have to measure connections between different parts of the human brain in vivo. To elucidate the structure of these connections, algorithms for tracking bundles of axonal fibers through the subcortical white matter rely on local estimates of the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in different parts of the brain. These functions describe the relative abundance of populations of axonal fibers crossing each other in each location. Multiple models exist for estimating fODFs. The quality of the resulting estimates can be quantified by means of a suitable measure of distance on the space of fODFs. However, there are multiple distance metrics that can be applied for this purpose, including smoothed $L_p$ distances and the Wasserstein metrics. Here, we give four reasons for the use of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) equipped with the arc-length, as a distance metric. (continued)"}
{"text": "  An important use of private data is to build machine learning classifiers. While there is a burgeoning literature on differentially private classification algorithms, we find that they are not practical in real applications due to two reasons. First, existing differentially private classifiers provide poor accuracy on real world datasets. Second, there is no known differentially private algorithm for empirically evaluating the private classifier on a private test dataset.   In this paper, we develop differentially private algorithms that mirror real world empirical machine learning workflows. We consider the private classifier training algorithm as a blackbox. We present private algorithms for selecting features that are input to the classifier. Though adding a preprocessing step takes away some of the privacy budget from the actual classification process (thus potentially making it noisier and less accurate), we show that our novel preprocessing techniques significantly increase classifier accuracy on three real-world datasets. We also present the first private algorithms for empirically constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on a private test set."}
{"text": "  In the convex optimization approach to online regret minimization, many methods have been developed to guarantee a $O(\\sqrt{T})$ bound on regret for subdifferentiable convex loss functions with bounded subgradients, by using a reduction to linear loss functions. This suggests that linear loss functions tend to be the hardest ones to learn against, regardless of the underlying decision spaces. We investigate this question in a systematic fashion looking at the interplay between the set of possible moves for both the decision maker and the adversarial environment. This allows us to highlight sharp distinctive behaviors about the learnability of piecewise linear loss functions. On the one hand, when the decision set of the decision maker is a polyhedron, we establish $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bounds on regret for a large class of piecewise linear loss functions with important applications in online linear optimization, repeated zero-sum Stackelberg games, online prediction with side information, and online two-stage optimization. On the other hand, we exhibit $o(\\sqrt{T})$ learning rates, achieved by the Follow-The-Leader algorithm, in online linear optimization when the boundary of the decision maker's decision set is curved and when $0$ does not lie in the convex hull of the environment's decision set. Hence, the curvature of the decision maker's decision set is a determining factor for the optimal learning rate. These results hold in a completely adversarial setting."}
{"text": "  Factor analysis provides linear factors that describe relationships between individual variables of a data set. We extend this classical formulation into linear factors that describe relationships between groups of variables, where each group represents either a set of related variables or a data set. The model also naturally extends canonical correlation analysis to more than two sets, in a way that is more flexible than previous extensions. Our solution is formulated as variational inference of a latent variable model with structural sparsity, and it consists of two hierarchical levels: The higher level models the relationships between the groups, whereas the lower models the observed variables given the higher level. We show that the resulting solution solves the group factor analysis problem accurately, outperforming alternative factor analysis based solutions as well as more straightforward implementations of group factor analysis. The method is demonstrated on two life science data sets, one on brain activation and the other on systems biology, illustrating its applicability to the analysis of different types of high-dimensional data sources."}
{"text": "  Several problems such as network intrusion, community detection, and disease outbreak can be described by observations attributed to nodes or edges of a graph. In these applications presence of intrusion, community or disease outbreak is characterized by novel observations on some unknown connected subgraph. These problems can be formulated in terms of optimization of suitable objectives on connected subgraphs, a problem which is generally computationally difficult. We overcome the combinatorics of connectivity by embedding connected subgraphs into linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Computationally efficient tests are then realized by optimizing convex objective functions subject to these LMI constraints. We prove, by means of a novel Euclidean embedding argument, that our tests are minimax optimal for exponential family of distributions on 1-D and 2-D lattices. We show that internal conductance of the connected subgraph family plays a fundamental role in characterizing detectability."}
{"text": "  In many real-world applications, data are represented by matrices or high-order tensors. Despite the promising performance, the existing two-dimensional discriminant analysis algorithms employ a single projection model to exploit the discriminant information for projection, making the model less flexible. In this paper, we propose a novel Compound Rank-k Projection (CRP) algorithm for bilinear analysis. CRP deals with matrices directly without transforming them into vectors, and it therefore preserves the correlations within the matrix and decreases the computation complexity. Different from the existing two dimensional discriminant analysis algorithms, objective function values of CRP increase monotonically.In addition, CRP utilizes multiple rank-k projection models to enable a larger search space in which the optimal solution can be found. In this way, the discriminant ability is enhanced."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised feature selection framework by mining correlations among multiple tasks and apply it to different multimedia applications. Instead of independently computing the importance of features for each task, our algorithm leverages shared knowledge from multiple related tasks, thus, improving the performance of feature selection. Note that we build our algorithm on assumption that different tasks share common structures. The proposed algorithm selects features in a batch mode, by which the correlations between different features are taken into consideration. Besides, considering the fact that labeling a large amount of training data in real world is both time-consuming and tedious, we adopt manifold learning which exploits both labeled and unlabeled training data for feature space analysis. Since the objective function is non-smooth and difficult to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm with fast convergence. Extensive experiments on different applications demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms."}
{"text": "  Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied to dimensionality reduction and data pre-processing for different applications in engineering, biology and social science. Classical PCA and its variants seek for linear projections of the original variables to obtain a low dimensional feature representation with maximal variance. One limitation is that it is very difficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is vulnerable to certain noisy data. In this paper, we propose a convex sparse principal component analysis (CSPCA) algorithm and apply it to feature analysis. First we show that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression optimization problem. Based on the discussion, the l 2 , 1 -norm minimization is incorporated into the objective function to make the regression coefficients sparse, thereby robust to the outliers. In addition, based on the sparse model used in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature, which in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output of our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under the PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize it. We apply the CSPCA algorithm to feature selection and conduct extensive experiments on six different benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection algorithms."}
{"text": "  Clustering is an effective technique in data mining to generate groups that are the matter of interest. Among various clustering approaches, the family of k-means algorithms and min-cut algorithms gain most popularity due to their simplicity and efficacy. The classical k-means algorithm partitions a number of data points into several subsets by iteratively updating the clustering centers and the associated data points. By contrast, a weighted undirected graph is constructed in min-cut algorithms which partition the vertices of the graph into two sets. However, existing clustering algorithms tend to cluster minority of data points into a subset, which shall be avoided when the target dataset is balanced. To achieve more accurate clustering for balanced dataset, we propose to leverage exclusive lasso on k-means and min-cut to regulate the balance degree of the clustering results. By optimizing our objective functions that build atop the exclusive lasso, we can make the clustering result as much balanced as possible. Extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets validate the advantage of the proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms."}
{"text": "  Spectral clustering is a key research topic in the field of machine learning and data mining. Most of the existing spectral clustering algorithms are built upon Gaussian Laplacian matrices, which are sensitive to parameters. We propose a novel parameter free, distance consistent Locally Linear Embedding. The proposed distance consistent LLE promises that edges between closer data points have greater weight.Furthermore, we propose a novel improved spectral clustering via embedded label propagation. Our algorithm is built upon two advancements of the state of the art:1) label propagation,which propagates a node\\'s labels to neighboring nodes according to their proximity; and 2) manifold learning, which has been widely used in its capacity to leverage the manifold structure of data points. First we perform standard spectral clustering on original data and assign each cluster to k nearest data points. Next, we propagate labels through dense, unlabeled data regions. Extensive experiments with various datasets validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to current state of the art spectral algorithms."}
{"text": "  While there are many studies on weight regularization, the study on structure regularization is rare. Many existing systems on structured prediction focus on increasing the level of structural dependencies within the model. However, this trend could have been misdirected, because our study suggests that complex structures are actually harmful to generalization ability in structured prediction. To control structure-based overfitting, we propose a structure regularization framework via \\emph{structure decomposition}, which decomposes training samples into mini-samples with simpler structures, deriving a model with better generalization power. We show both theoretically and empirically that structure regularization can effectively control overfitting risk and lead to better accuracy. As a by-product, the proposed method can also substantially accelerate the training speed. The method and the theoretical results can apply to general graphical models with arbitrary structures. Experiments on well-known tasks demonstrate that our method can easily beat the benchmark systems on those highly-competitive tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies yet with substantially faster training speed."}
{"text": "  We study revenue optimization learning algorithms for posted-price auctions with strategic buyers. We analyze a very broad family of monotone regret minimization algorithms for this problem, which includes the previously best known algorithm, and show that no algorithm in that family admits a strategic regret more favorable than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$. We then introduce a new algorithm that achieves a strategic regret differing from the lower bound only by a factor in $O(\\log T)$, an exponential improvement upon the previous best algorithm. Our new algorithm admits a natural analysis and simpler proofs, and the ideas behind its design are general. We also report the results of empirical evaluations comparing our algorithm with the previous state of the art and show a consistent exponential improvement in several different scenarios."}
{"text": "  Spectral clustering is a fundamental technique in the field of data mining and information processing. Most existing spectral clustering algorithms integrate dimensionality reduction into the clustering process assisted by manifold learning in the original space. However, the manifold in reduced-dimensional subspace is likely to exhibit altered properties in contrast with the original space. Thus, applying manifold information obtained from the original space to the clustering process in a low-dimensional subspace is prone to inferior performance. Aiming to address this issue, we propose a novel convex algorithm that mines the manifold structure in the low-dimensional subspace. In addition, our unified learning process makes the manifold learning particularly tailored for the clustering. Compared with other related methods, the proposed algorithm results in more structured clustering result. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets in comparison with some state-of-the-art clustering approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has quite promising clustering performance."}
{"text": "  This article considers the problem of multi-group classification in the setting where the number of variables $p$ is larger than the number of observations $n$. Several methods have been proposed in the literature that address this problem, however their variable selection performance is either unknown or suboptimal to the results known in the two-group case. In this work we provide sharp conditions for the consistent recovery of relevant variables in the multi-group case using the discriminant analysis proposal of Gaynanova et al., 2014. We achieve the rates of convergence that attain the optimal scaling of the sample size $n$, number of variables $p$ and the sparsity level $s$. These rates are significantly faster than the best known results in the multi-group case. Moreover, they coincide with the optimal minimax rates for the two-group case. We validate our theoretical results with numerical analysis."}
{"text": "  The growing amount of high dimensional data in different machine learning applications requires more efficient and scalable optimization algorithms. In this work, we consider combining two techniques, parallelism and Nesterov's acceleration, to design faster algorithms for L1-regularized loss. We first simplify BOOM, a variant of gradient descent, and study it in a unified framework, which allows us to not only propose a refined measurement of sparsity to improve BOOM, but also show that BOOM is provably slower than FISTA. Moving on to parallel coordinate descent methods, we then propose an efficient accelerated version of Shotgun, improving the convergence rate from $O(1/t)$ to $O(1/t^2)$. Our algorithm enjoys a concise form and analysis compared to previous work, and also allows one to study several connected work in a unified way."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose an efficient semidefinite programming (SDP) approach to worst-case linear discriminant analysis (WLDA). Compared with the traditional LDA, WLDA considers the dimensionality reduction problem from the worst-case viewpoint, which is in general more robust for classification. However, the original problem of WLDA is non-convex and difficult to optimize. In this paper, we reformulate the optimization problem of WLDA into a sequence of semidefinite feasibility problems. To efficiently solve the semidefinite feasibility problems, we design a new scalable optimization method with quasi-Newton methods and eigen-decomposition being the core components. The proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than standard interior-point based SDP solvers.   Experiments on a variety of classification problems demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance than standard LDA. Our method is also much faster and more scalable than standard interior-point SDP solvers based WLDA. The computational complexity for an SDP with $m$ constraints and matrices of size $d$ by $d$ is roughly reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(m^3+md^3+m^2d^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ ($m>d$ in our case)."}
{"text": "  This report discusses two new indices for comparing clusterings of a set of points. The motivation for looking at new ways for comparing clusterings stems from the fact that the existing clustering indices are based on set cardinality alone and do not consider the positions of data points. The new indices, namely, the Random Walk index (RWI) and Variation of Information with Neighbors (VIN), are both inspired by the clustering metric Variation of Information (VI). VI possesses some interesting theoretical properties which are also desirable in a metric for comparing clusterings. We define our indices and discuss some of their explored properties which appear relevant for a clustering index. We also include the results of these indices on clusterings of some example data sets."}
{"text": "  Matrix factorization is a popular approach for large-scale matrix completion. The optimization formulation based on matrix factorization can be solved very efficiently by standard algorithms in practice. However, due to the non-convexity caused by the factorization model, there is a limited theoretical understanding of this formulation. In this paper, we establish a theoretical guarantee for the factorization formulation to correctly recover the underlying low-rank matrix. In particular, we show that under similar conditions to those in previous works, many standard optimization algorithms converge to the global optima of a factorization formulation, and recover the true low-rank matrix. We study the local geometry of a properly regularized factorization formulation and prove that any stationary point in a certain local region is globally optimal. A major difference of our work from the existing results is that we do not need resampling in either the algorithm or its analysis. Compared to other works on nonconvex optimization, one extra difficulty lies in analyzing nonconvex constrained optimization when the constraint (or the corresponding regularizer) is not \"consistent\" with the gradient direction. One technical contribution is the perturbation analysis for non-symmetric matrix factorization."}
{"text": "  We study the connection between the highly non-convex loss function of a simple model of the fully-connected feed-forward neural network and the Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass model under the assumptions of: i) variable independence, ii) redundancy in network parametrization, and iii) uniformity. These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting."}
{"text": "  In theory, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are well suited to streaming data scenarios due to their ability to adapt model complexity with the observed data. Unfortunately, such benefits have not been fully realized in practice; existing inference algorithms are either not applicable to streaming applications or not extensible to BNP models. For the special case of Dirichlet processes, streaming inference has been considered. However, there is growing interest in more flexible BNP models building on the class of normalized random measures (NRMs). We work within this general framework and present a streaming variational inference algorithm for NRM mixture models. Our algorithm is based on assumed density filtering (ADF), leading straightforwardly to expectation propagation (EP) for large-scale batch inference as well. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on clustering documents in large, streaming text corpora."}

{"text": "  Deep Gaussian processes provide a flexible approach to probabilistic modelling of data using either supervised or unsupervised learning. For tractable inference approximations to the marginal likelihood of the model must be made. The original approach to approximate inference in these models used variational compression to allow for approximate variational marginalization of the hidden variables leading to a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model [Damianou and Lawrence, 2013]. In this paper we extend this idea with a nested variational compression. The resulting lower bound on the likelihood can be easily parallelized or adapted for stochastic variational inference."}
{"text": "  In this work we consider the learning setting where, in addition to the training set, the learner receives a collection of auxiliary hypotheses originating from other tasks. We focus on a broad class of ERM-based linear algorithms that can be instantiated with any non-negative smooth loss function and any strongly convex regularizer. We establish generalization and excess risk bounds, showing that, if the algorithm is fed with a good combination of source hypotheses, generalization happens at the fast rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/m)$ instead of the usual $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{m})$. On the other hand, if the source hypotheses combination is a misfit for the target task, we recover the usual learning rate. As a byproduct of our study, we also prove a new bound on the Rademacher complexity of the smooth loss class under weaker assumptions compared to previous works."}
{"text": "  The problem of automatically clustering data is an age old problem. People have created numerous algorithms to tackle this problem. The execution time of any of this algorithm grows with the number of input points and the number of cluster centers required. To reduce the number of input points we could average the points locally and use the means or the local centers as the input for clustering. However since the required number of local centers is very high, running the clustering algorithm on the entire dataset to obtain these representational points is very time consuming. To remedy this problem, in this paper we are proposing two subclustering schemes where by we subdivide the dataset into smaller sets and run the clustering algorithm on the smaller datasets to obtain the required number of datapoints to run our clustering algorithm with. As we are subdividing the given dataset, we could run clustering algorithm on each smaller piece of the dataset in parallel. We found that both parallel and serial execution of this method to be much faster than the original clustering algorithm and error in running the clustering algorithm on a reduced set to be very less."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we theoretically justify an approach popular among participants of the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge to optimize approximate median significance (AMS). The approach is based on the following two-stage procedure. First, a real-valued function is learned by minimizing a surrogate loss for binary classification, such as logistic loss, on the training sample. Then, a threshold is tuned on a separate validation sample, by direct optimization of AMS. We show that the regret of the resulting (thresholded) classifier measured with respect to the squared AMS, is upperbounded by the regret of the underlying real-valued function measured with respect to the logistic loss. Hence, we prove that minimizing logistic surrogate is a consistent method of optimizing AMS."}
{"text": "  We propose a likelihood ratio based inferential framework for high dimensional semiparametric generalized linear models. This framework addresses a variety of challenging problems in high dimensional data analysis, including incomplete data, selection bias, and heterogeneous multitask learning. Our work has three main contributions. (i) We develop a regularized statistical chromatography approach to infer the parameter of interest under the proposed semiparametric generalized linear model without the need of estimating the unknown base measure function. (ii) We propose a new framework to construct post-regularization confidence regions and tests for the low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. Unlike existing post-regularization inferential methods, our approach is based on a novel directional likelihood. In particular, the framework naturally handles generic regularized estimators with nonconvex penalty functions and it can be used to infer least false parameters under misspecified models. (iii) We develop new concentration inequalities and normal approximation results for U-statistics with unbounded kernels, which are of independent interest. We demonstrate the consequences of the general theory by using an example of missing data problem. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis are provided to illustrate our proposed approach."}

{"text": "  A widely-used tool for binary classification is the Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised learning technique that finds the \"maximum margin\" linear separator between the two classes. While SVMs have been well studied in the batch (offline) setting, there is considerably less work on the streaming (online) setting, which requires only a single pass over the data using sub-linear space. Existing streaming algorithms are not yet competitive with the batch implementation. In this paper, we use the formulation of the SVM as a minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem to provide a streaming SVM algorithm based off of the blurred ball cover originally proposed by Agarwal and Sharathkumar. Our implementation consistently outperforms existing streaming SVM approaches and provides higher accuracies than libSVM on several datasets, thus making it competitive with the standard SVM batch implementation."}
{"text": "  Deep learning has attracted great attention recently and yielded the state of the art performance in dimension reduction and classification problems. However, it cannot effectively handle the structured output prediction, e.g. sequential labeling. In this paper, we propose a deep learning structure, which can learn discriminative features for sequential labeling problems. More specifically, we add the inter-relationship between labels in our deep learning structure, in order to incorporate the context information from the sequential data. Thus, our model is more powerful than linear Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) because the objective function learns latent non-linear features so that target labeling can be better predicted. We pretrain the deep structure with stacked restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) for feature learning and optimize our objective function with online learning algorithm, a mixture of perceptron training and stochastic gradient descent. We test our model on different challenge tasks, and show that our model outperforms significantly over the completive baselines."}
{"text": "  Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis which is made more challenging by overlaps between communities which often occur in practice. Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative model for overlapping communities, which can be thought of as a generalization of the degree-corrected stochastic block model. We develop an efficient spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with the overlaps by employing the K-medians algorithm rather than the usual K-means for clustering in the spectral domain. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when networks are not too sparse and the overlaps between communities not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs very well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection."}
{"text": "  Matching datasets of multiple modalities has become an important task in data analysis. Existing methods often rely on the embedding and transformation of each single modality without utilizing any correspondence information, which often results in sub-optimal matching performance. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear manifold matching algorithm using shortest-path distance and joint neighborhood selection. Specifically, a joint nearest-neighbor graph is built for all modalities. Then the shortest-path distance within each modality is calculated from the joint neighborhood graph, followed by embedding into and matching in a common low-dimensional Euclidean space. Compared to existing algorithms, our approach exhibits superior performance for matching disparate datasets of multiple modalities."}

The research problem generalizes the joint matrix-tensor factorization problem to arbitrary sets of tensors of any depth, including matrices, can be interpreted as unsupervised multi-view learning from multiple data tensors, and can be generalized to relax the usual trilinear tensor factorization assumptions. The result is a factorization of the set of tensors into factors shared by any subsets of the tensors, and factors private to individual tensors. We demonstrate the performance against existing baselines in multiple tensor factorization tasks in structural toxicogenomics and functional neuroimaging."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a new max-margin based discriminative feature learning method. Specifically, we aim at learning a low-dimensional feature representation, so as to maximize the global margin of the data and make the samples from the same class as close as possible. In order to enhance the robustness to noise, a $l_{2,1}$ norm constraint is introduced to make the transformation matrix in group sparsity. In addition, for multi-class classification tasks, we further intend to learn and leverage the correlation relationships among multiple class tasks for assisting in learning discriminative features. The experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed method against the related state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  We consider learning from data of variable quality that may be obtained from different heterogeneous sources. Addressing learning from heterogeneous data in its full generality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we adopt instead a model in which data is observed through heterogeneous noise, where the noise level reflects the quality of the data source. We study how to use stochastic gradient algorithms to learn in this model. Our study is motivated by two concrete examples where this problem arises naturally: learning with local differential privacy based on data from multiple sources with different privacy requirements, and learning from data with labels of variable quality.   The main contribution of this paper is to identify how heterogeneous noise impacts performance. We show that given two datasets with heterogeneous noise, the order in which to use them in standard SGD depends on the learning rate. We propose a method for changing the learning rate as a function of the heterogeneity, and prove new regret bounds for our method in two cases of interest. Experiments on real data show that our method performs better than using a single learning rate and using only the less noisy of the two datasets when the noise level is low to moderate."}
{"text": "  Online multiple-output regression is an important machine learning technique for modeling, predicting, and compressing multi-dimensional correlated data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel online multiple-output regression method, called MORES, for stream data. MORES can \\emph{dynamically} learn the structure of the coefficients change in each update step to facilitate the model's continuous refinement. We observe that limited expressive ability of the regression model, especially in the preliminary stage of online update, often leads to the variables in the residual errors being dependent. In light of this point, MORES intends to \\emph{dynamically} learn and leverage the structure of the residual errors to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we define three statistical variables to \\emph{exactly} represent all the seen samples for \\emph{incrementally} calculating prediction loss in each online update round, which can avoid loading all the training data into memory for updating model, and also effectively prevent drastic fluctuation of the model in the presence of noise. Furthermore, we introduce a forgetting factor to set different weights on samples so as to track the data streams' evolving characteristics quickly from the latest samples. Experiments on one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the update speed of MORES is at least 2000 samples processed per second on the three real-world datasets, more than 15 times faster than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithm."}
{"text": "  In large scale machine learning and data mining problems with high feature dimensionality, the Euclidean distance between data points can be uninformative, and Distance Metric Learning (DML) is often desired to learn a proper similarity measure (using side information such as example data pairs being similar or dissimilar). However, high dimensionality and large volume of pairwise constraints in modern big data can lead to prohibitive computational cost for both the original DML formulation in Xing et al. (2002) and later extensions. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for DML, and a large-scale implementation on a parameter server architecture. Our approach builds on a parallelizable reformulation of Xing et al. (2002), and an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent optimization procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first distributed solution to DML, and we show that, on a system with 256 CPU cores, our program is able to complete a DML task on a dataset with 1 million data points, 22-thousand features, and 200 million labeled data pairs, in 15 hours; and the learned metric shows great effectiveness in properly measuring distances."}
{"text": "  The notion of metric plays a key role in machine learning problems such as classification, clustering or ranking.

{"text": "  Two recently introduced criteria for estimation of generative models are both based on a reduction to binary classification. Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is an estimation procedure in which a generative model is trained to be able to distinguish data samples from noise samples. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are pairs of generator and discriminator networks, with the generator network learning to generate samples by attempting to fool the discriminator network into believing its samples are real data. Both estimation procedures use the same function to drive learning, which naturally raises questions about how they are related to each other, as well as whether this function is related to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). NCE corresponds to training an internal data model belonging to the {\\em discriminator} network but using a fixed generator network. We show that a variant of NCE, with a dynamic generator network, is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation. Since pairing a learned discriminator with an appropriate dynamically selected generator recovers MLE, one might expect the reverse to hold for pairing a learned generator with a certain discriminator. However, we show that recovering MLE for a learned generator requires departing from the distinguishability game. Specifically:   (i) The expected gradient of the NCE discriminator can be made to match the expected gradient of   MLE, if one is allowed to use a non-stationary noise distribution for NCE,   (ii) No choice of discriminator network can make the expected gradient for the GAN generator match that of MLE, and   (iii) The existing theory does not guarantee that GANs will converge in the non-convex case.   This suggests that the key next step in GAN research is to determine whether GANs converge, and if not, to modify their training algorithm to force convergence."}

{"text": "  Energy-based models are popular in machine learning due to the elegance of their formulation and their relationship to statistical physics. Among these, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), and its staple training algorithm contrastive divergence (CD), have been the prototype for some recent advancements in the unsupervised training of deep neural networks. However, CD has limited theoretical motivation, and can in some cases produce undesirable behavior. Here, we investigate the performance of Minimum Probability Flow (MPF) learning for training RBMs. Unlike CD, with its focus on approximating an intractable partition function via Gibbs sampling, MPF proposes a tractable, consistent, objective function defined in terms of a Taylor expansion of the KL divergence with respect to sampling dynamics. Here we propose a more general form for the sampling dynamics in MPF, and explore the consequences of different choices for these dynamics for training RBMs. Experimental results show MPF outperforming CD for various RBM configurations."}
{"text": "  We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm."}
{"text": "  High-dimensional data often lie in low-dimensional subspaces corresponding to different classes they belong to. Finding sparse representations of data points in a dictionary built using the collection of data helps to uncover low-dimensional subspaces and address problems such as clustering, classification, subset selection and more. In this paper, we address the problem of recovering sparse representations for noisy data points in a dictionary whose columns correspond to corrupted data lying close to a union of subspaces. We consider a constrained $\\ell_1$-minimization and study conditions under which the solution of the proposed optimization satisfies the approximate subspace-sparse recovery condition. More specifically, we show that each noisy data point, perturbed from a subspace by a noise of the magnitude of $\\varepsilon$, will be reconstructed using data points from the same subspace with a small error of the order of $O(\\varepsilon)$ and that the coefficients corresponding to data points in other subspaces will be sufficiently small, \\ie, of the order of $O(\\varepsilon)$. We do not impose any randomness assumption on the arrangement of subspaces or distribution of data points in each subspace. Our framework is based on a novel generalization of the null-space property to the setting where data lie in multiple subspaces, the number of data points in each subspace exceeds the dimension of the subspace, and all data points are corrupted by noise. Moreover, assuming a random distribution for data points, we further show that coefficients from the desired support not only reconstruct a given point with high accuracy, but also have sufficiently large values, \\ie, of the order of $O(1)$."}
{"text": "  Given $n$ i.i.d. observations of a random vector $(X,Z)$, where $X$ is a high-dimensional vector and $Z$ is a low-dimensional index variable, we study the problem of estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix $\\Omega(z) = (E[(X-E[X \\mid Z])(X-E[X \\mid Z])^T \\mid Z=z])^{-1}$ under the assumption that the set of non-zero elements is small and does not depend on the index variable. We develop a novel procedure that combines the ideas of the local constant smoothing and the group Lasso for estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix. A proximal iterative smoothing algorithm is used to solve the corresponding convex optimization problems. We prove that our procedure recovers the conditional independence assumptions of the distribution $X \\mid Z$ with high probability. This result is established by developing a uniform deviation bound for the high-dimensional conditional covariance matrix from its population counterpart, which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we develop point-wise confidence intervals for individual elements of the conditional inverse covariance matrix. We perform extensive simulation studies, in which we demonstrate that our proposed procedure outperforms sensible competitors. We illustrate our proposal on a S&P 500 stock price data set."}
{"text": "  Recent studies in the literature have paid much attention to the sparsity in linear classification tasks. One motivation of imposing sparsity assumption on the linear discriminant direction is to rule out the noninformative features, making hardly contribution to the classification problem. Most of those work were focused on the scenarios of binary classification. In the presence of multi-class data, preceding researches recommended individually pairwise sparse linear discriminant analysis(LDA). However, further sparsity should be explored. In this paper, an estimator of grouped LASSO type is proposed to take advantage of sparsity for multi-class data. It enjoys appealing non-asymptotic properties which allows insignificant correlations among features. This estimator exhibits superior capability on both simulated and real data."}
{"text": "  We propose a new class of semiparametric exponential family graphical models for the analysis of high dimensional mixed data. Different from the existing mixed graphical models, we allow the nodewise conditional distributions to be semiparametric generalized linear models with unspecified base measure functions. Thus, one advantage of our method is that it is unnecessary to specify the type of each node and the method is more convenient to apply in practice. Under the proposed model, we consider both problems of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing in high dimensions. In particular, we propose a symmetric pairwise score test for the presence of a single edge in the graph. Compared to the existing methods for hypothesis tests, our approach takes into account of the symmetry of the parameters, such that the inferential results are invariant with respect to the different parametrizations of the same edge. Thorough numerical simulations and a real data example are provided to back up our results."}
{"text": "  We propose a robust inferential procedure for assessing uncertainties of parameter estimation in high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension $p$ can grow exponentially fast with the sample size $n$. Our method combines the de-biasing technique with the composite quantile function to construct an estimator that is asymptotically normal. Hence it can be used to construct valid confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. Our estimator is robust and does not require the existence of first or second moment of the noise distribution. It also preserves efficiency in the sense that the worst case efficiency loss is less than 30\\% compared to the square-loss-based de-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better than the latter, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Our de-biasing procedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized composite quantile regression. Instead, it allows for any first-stage estimator with desired convergence rate and empirical sparsity. The paper also provides new proof techniques for developing theoretical guarantees of inferential procedures with non-smooth loss functions. To establish the main results, we exploit the local curvature of the conditional expectation of composite quantile loss and apply empirical process theories to control the difference between empirical quantities and their conditional expectations. Our results are established under weaker assumptions compared to existing work on inference for high-dimensional quantile regression. Furthermore, we consider a high-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameters by applying the Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. We also study distributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce computation complexity when the sample size is massive. Finally, we provide empirical results to verify the theory."}
{"text": "  We provide a general theory of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for inferring high dimensional latent variable models. In particular, we make two contributions: (i) For parameter estimation, we propose a novel high dimensional EM algorithm which naturally incorporates sparsity structure into parameter estimation. With an appropriate initialization, this algorithm converges at a geometric rate and attains an estimator with the (near-)optimal statistical rate of convergence. (ii) Based on the obtained estimator, we propose new inferential procedures for testing hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals for low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. For a broad family of statistical models, our framework establishes the first computationally feasible approach for optimal estimation and asymptotic inference in high dimensions. Our theory is supported by thorough numerical results."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of uncertainty assessment for low dimensional components in high dimensional models. Specifically, we propose a decorrelated score function to handle the impact of high dimensional nuisance parameters. We consider both hypothesis tests and confidence regions for generic penalized M-estimators. Unlike most existing inferential methods which are tailored for individual models, our approach provides a general framework for high dimensional inference and is applicable to a wide range of applications. From the testing perspective, we develop general theorems to characterize the limiting distributions of the decorrelated score test statistic under both null hypothesis and local alternatives. These results provide asymptotic guarantees on the type I errors and local powers of the proposed test. Furthermore, we show that the decorrelated score function can be used to construct point and confidence region estimators that are semiparametrically efficient. We also generalize this framework to broaden its applications. First, we extend it to handle high dimensional null hypothesis, where the number of parameters of interest can increase exponentially fast with the sample size. Second, we establish the theory for model misspecification. Third, we go beyond the likelihood framework, by introducing the generalized score test based on general loss functions. Thorough numerical studies are conducted to back up the developed theoretical results."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of clustering with relative constraints, where each constraint specifies relative similarities among instances. In particular, each constraint $(x_i, x_j, x_k)$ is acquired by posing a query: is instance $x_i$ more similar to $x_j$ than to $x_k$? We consider the scenario where answers to such queries are based on an underlying (but unknown) class concept, which we aim to discover via clustering. Different from most existing methods that only consider constraints derived from yes and no answers, we also incorporate don't know responses. We introduce a Discriminative Clustering method with Relative Constraints (DCRC) which assumes a natural probabilistic relationship between instances, their underlying cluster memberships, and the observed constraints. The objective is to maximize the model likelihood given the constraints, and in the meantime enforce cluster separation and cluster balance by also making use of the unlabeled instances. We evaluated the proposed method using constraints generated from ground-truth class labels, and from (noisy) human judgments from a user study. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) the usefulness of relative constraints, in particular when don't know answers are considered; 2) the improved performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods that utilize either relative or pairwise constraints; and 3) the robustness of our method in the presence of noisy constraints, such as those provided by human judgement."}
{"text": "  Recently theoretical guarantees have been obtained for matrix completion in the non-uniform sampling regime. In particular, if the sampling distribution aligns with the underlying matrix's leverage scores, then with high probability nuclear norm minimization will exactly recover the low rank matrix. In this article, we analyze the scenario in which the non-uniform sampling distribution may or may not not align with the underlying matrix's leverage scores. Here we explore learning the parameters for weighted nuclear norm minimization in terms of the empirical sampling distribution. We provide a sufficiency condition for these learned weights which provide an exact recovery guarantee for weighted nuclear norm minimization. It has been established that a specific choice of weights in terms of the true sampling distribution not only allows for weighted nuclear norm minimization to exactly recover the low rank matrix, but also allows for a quantifiable relaxation in the exact recovery conditions. In this article we extend this quantifiable relaxation in exact recovery conditions for a specific choice of weights defined analogously in terms of the empirical distribution as opposed to the true sampling distribution. To accomplish this we employ a concentration of measure bound and a large deviation bound. We also present numerical evidence for the healthy robustness of the weighted nuclear norm minimization algorithm to the choice of empirically learned weights. These numerical experiments show that for a variety of easily computable empirical weights, weighted nuclear norm minimization outperforms unweighted nuclear norm minimization in the non-uniform sampling regime."}

{"text": "  Big data comes in various ways, types, shapes, forms and sizes. Indeed, almost all areas of science, technology, medicine, public health, economics, business, linguistics and social science are bombarded by ever increasing flows of data begging to analyzed efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we propose a rough idea of a possible taxonomy of big data, along with some of the most commonly used tools for handling each particular category of bigness. The dimensionality p of the input space and the sample size n are usually the main ingredients in the characterization of data bigness. The specific statistical machine learning technique used to handle a particular big data set will depend on which category it falls in within the bigness taxonomy. Large p small n data sets for instance require a different set of tools from the large n small p variety. Among other tools, we discuss Preprocessing, Standardization, Imputation, Projection, Regularization, Penalization, Compression, Reduction, Selection, Kernelization, Hybridization, Parallelization, Aggregation, Randomization, Replication, Sequentialization. Indeed, it is important to emphasize right away that the so-called no free lunch theorem applies here, in the sense that there is no universally superior method that outperforms all other methods on all categories of bigness. It is also important to stress the fact that simplicity in the sense of Ockham's razor non plurality principle of parsimony tends to reign supreme when it comes to massive data. We conclude with a comparison of the predictive performance of some of the most commonly used methods on a few data sets."}
{"text": "  We showed in this work how the Hassanat distance metric enhances the performance of the nearest neighbour classifiers. The results demonstrate the superiority of this distance metric over the traditional and most-used distances, such as Manhattan distance and Euclidian distance. Moreover, we proved that the Hassanat distance metric is invariant to data scale, noise and outliers. Throughout this work, it is clearly notable that both ENN and IINC performed very well with the distance investigated, as their accuracy increased significantly by 3.3% and 3.1% respectively, with no significant advantage of the ENN over the IINC in terms of accuracy. Correspondingly, it can be noted from our results that there is no optimal algorithm that can solve all real-life problems perfectly; this is supported by the no-free-lunch theorem"}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of unveiling the implicit network structure of node interactions (such as user interactions in a social network), based only on high-frequency timestamps. Our inference is based on the minimization of the least-squares loss associated with a multivariate Hawkes model, penalized by $\\ell_1$ and trace norm of the interaction tensor. We provide a first theoretical analysis for this problem, that includes sparsity and low-rank inducing penalizations. This result involves a new data-driven concentration inequality for matrix martingales in continuous time with observable variance, which is a result of independent interest and a broad range of possible applications since it extends to matrix martingales former results restricted to the scalar case. A consequence of our analysis is the construction of sharply tuned $\\ell_1$ and trace-norm penalizations, that leads to a data-driven scaling of the variability of information available for each users. Numerical experiments illustrate the significant improvements achieved by the use of such data-driven penalizations."}
{"text": "  Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an effective model for many classification problems. However, SVM needs the solution of a quadratic program which require specialized code. In addition, SVM has many parameters, which affects the performance of SVM classifier. Recently, the Generalized Eigenvalue Proximal SVM (GEPSVM) has been presented to solve the SVM complexity. In real world applications data may affected by error or noise, working with this data is a challenging problem. In this paper, an approach has been proposed to overcome this problem. This method is called DSA-GEPSVM. The main improvements are carried out based on the following: 1) a novel fuzzy values in the linear case. 2) A new Kernel function in the nonlinear case. 3) Differential Search Algorithm (DSA) is reformulated to find near optimal values of the GEPSVM parameters and its kernel parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to find the suitable parameter values, and has higher classification accuracy compared with some other algorithms."}
{"text": "  This paper is concerned with the problems of interaction screening and nonlinear classification in a high-dimensional setting. We propose a two-step procedure, IIS-SQDA, where in the first step an innovated interaction screening (IIS) approach based on transforming the original $p$-dimensional feature vector is proposed, and in the second step a sparse quadratic discriminant analysis (SQDA) is proposed for further selecting important interactions and main effects and simultaneously conducting classification. Our IIS approach screens important interactions by examining only $p$ features instead of all two-way interactions of order $O(p^2)$. Our theory shows that the proposed method enjoys sure screening property in interaction selection in the high-dimensional setting of $p$ growing exponentially with the sample size. In the selection and classification step, we establish a sparse inequality on the estimated coefficient vector for QDA and prove that the classification error of our procedure can be upper-bounded by the oracle classification error plus some smaller order term. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis show that our proposal compares favorably with existing methods in interaction selection and high-dimensional classification."}
{"text": "  Learning a kernel matrix from relative comparison human feedback is an important problem with applications in collaborative filtering, object retrieval, and search. For learning a kernel over a large number of objects, existing methods face significant scalability issues inhibiting the application of these methods to settings where a kernel is learned in an online and timely fashion. In this paper we propose a novel framework called Efficient online Relative comparison Kernel LEarning (ERKLE), for efficiently learning the similarity of a large set of objects in an online manner. We learn a kernel from relative comparisons via stochastic gradient descent, one query response at a time, by taking advantage of the sparse and low-rank properties of the gradient to efficiently restrict the kernel to lie in the space of positive semidefinite matrices. In addition, we derive a passive-aggressive online update for minimally satisfying new relative comparisons as to not disrupt the influence of previously obtained comparisons. Experimentally, we demonstrate a considerable improvement in speed while obtaining improved or comparable accuracy compared to current methods in the online learning setting."}
{"text": "  High-content screening uses large collections of unlabeled cell image data to reason about genetics or cell biology. Two important tasks are to identify those cells which bear interesting phenotypes, and to identify sub-populations enriched for these phenotypes. This exploratory data analysis usually involves dimensionality reduction followed by clustering, in the hope that clusters represent a phenotype. We propose the use of stacked de-noising auto-encoders to perform dimensionality reduction for high-content screening. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over PCA, Local Linear Embedding, Kernel PCA and Isomap."}
{"text": "  Measuring dependence between two random variables is very important, and critical in many applied areas such as variable selection, brain network analysis. However, we do not know what kind of functional relationship is between two covariates, which requires the dependence measure to be equitable. That is, it gives similar scores to equally noisy relationship of different types. In fact, the dependence score is a continuous random variable taking values in $[0,1]$, thus it is theoretically impossible to give similar scores. In this paper, we introduce a new definition of equitability of a dependence measure, i.e, power-equitable (weak-equitable) and show by simulation that HHG and Copula Dependence Coefficient (CDC) are weak-equitable."}
{"text": "  In certain situations that shall be undoubtedly more and more common in the Big Data era, the datasets available are so massive that computing statistics over the full sample is hardly feasible, if not unfeasible. A natural approach in this context consists in using survey schemes and substituting the \"full data\" statistics with their counterparts based on the resulting random samples, of manageable size. It is the main purpose of this paper to investigate the impact of survey sampling with unequal inclusion probabilities on stochastic gradient descent-based M-estimation methods in large-scale statistical and machine-learning problems. Precisely, we prove that, in presence of some a priori information, one may significantly increase asymptotic accuracy when choosing appropriate first order inclusion probabilities, without affecting complexity. These striking results are described here by limit theorems and are also illustrated by numerical experiments."}
{"text": "  In a variety of problems, the number and state of multiple moving targets are unknown and are subject to be inferred from their measurements obtained by a sensor with limited sensing ability. This type of problems is raised in a variety of applications, including monitoring of endangered species, cleaning, and surveillance. Particle filters are widely used to estimate target state from its prior information and its measurements that recently become available, especially for the cases when the measurement model and the prior distribution of state of interest are non-Gaussian. However, the problem of estimating number of total targets and their state becomes intractable when the number of total targets and the measurement-target association are unknown. This paper presents a novel Gaussian particle filter technique that combines Kalman filter and particle filter for estimating the number and state of total targets based on the measurement obtained online. The estimation is represented by a set of weighted particles, different from classical particle filter, where each particle is a Gaussian distribution instead of a point mass."}
{"text": "  The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension measures the complexity of a learning machine, and a low VC dimension leads to good generalization. The recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) learns a hyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact bound on the VC dimension. This paper extends the MCM classifier to the fuzzy domain. The use of a fuzzy membership is known to reduce the effect of outliers, and to reduce the effect of noise on learning. Experimental results show, that on a number of benchmark datasets, the the fuzzy MCM classifier outperforms SVMs and the conventional MCM in terms of generalization, and that the fuzzy MCM uses fewer support vectors. On several benchmark datasets, the fuzzy MCM classifier yields excellent test set accuracies while using one-tenth the number of support vectors used by SVMs."}
{"text": "  Using a Bayesian approach, we consider the problem of recovering sparse signals under additive sparse and dense noise. Typically, sparse noise models outliers, impulse bursts or data loss. To handle sparse noise, existing methods simultaneously estimate the sparse signal of interest and the sparse noise of no interest. For estimating the sparse signal, without the need of estimating the sparse noise, we construct a robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In the RVM, sparse noise and ever present dense noise are treated through a combined noise model. The precision of combined noise is modeled by a diagonal matrix. We show that the new RVM update equations correspond to a non-symmetric sparsity inducing cost function. Further, the combined modeling is found to be computationally more efficient. We also extend the method to block-sparse signals and noise with known and unknown block structures. Through simulations, we show the performance and computation efficiency of the new RVM in several applications: recovery of sparse and block sparse signals, housing price prediction and image denoising."}
{"text": "  We propose novel methods for max-cost Discrete Function Evaluation Problem (DFEP) under budget constraints. We are motivated by applications such as clinical diagnosis where a patient is subjected to a sequence of (possibly expensive) tests before a decision is made. Our goal is to develop strategies for minimizing max-costs. The problem is known to be NP hard and greedy methods based on specialized impurity functions have been proposed. We develop a broad class of \\emph{admissible} impurity functions that admit monomials, classes of polynomials, and hinge-loss functions that allow for flexible impurity design with provably optimal approximation bounds. This flexibility is important for datasets when max-cost can be overly sensitive to \"outliers.\" Outliers bias max-cost to a few examples that require a large number of tests for classification. We design admissible functions that allow for accuracy-cost trade-off and result in $O(\\log n)$ guarantees of the optimal cost among trees with corresponding classification accuracy levels."}
{"text": "  Item response theory (IRT) models for categorical response data are widely used in the analysis of educational data, computerized adaptive testing, and psychological surveys. However, most IRT models rely on both the assumption that categories are strictly ordered and the assumption that this ordering is known a priori. These assumptions are impractical in many real-world scenarios, such as multiple-choice exams where the levels of incorrectness for the distractor categories are often unknown. While a number of results exist on IRT models for unordered categorical data, they tend to have restrictive modeling assumptions that lead to poor data fitting performance in practice. Furthermore, existing unordered categorical models have parameters that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for unordered categorical IRT that we call SPRITE (short for stochastic polytomous response item model) that: (i) analyzes both ordered and unordered categories, (ii) offers interpretable outputs, and (iii) provides improved data fitting compared to existing models. We compare SPRITE to existing item response models and demonstrate its efficacy on both synthetic and real-world educational datasets."}
{"text": "  Clustering is an essential problem in machine learning and data mining. One vital factor that impacts clustering performance is how to learn or design the data representation (or features). Fortunately, recent advances in deep learning can learn unsupervised features effectively, and have yielded state of the art performance in many classification problems, such as character recognition, object recognition and document categorization. However, little attention has been paid to the potential of deep learning for unsupervised clustering problems. In this paper, we propose a deep belief network with nonparametric clustering. As an unsupervised method, our model first leverages the advantages of deep learning for feature representation and dimension reduction. Then, it performs nonparametric clustering under a maximum margin framework -- a discriminative clustering model and can be trained online efficiently in the code space. Lastly model parameters are refined in the deep belief network. Thus, this model can learn features for clustering and infer model complexity in an unified framework. The experimental results show the advantage of our approach over competitive baselines."}
{"text": "  We consider classification and regression tasks where we have missing data and assume that the (clean) data resides in a low rank subspace. Finding a hidden subspace is known to be computationally hard. Nevertheless, using a non-proper formulation we give an efficient agnostic algorithm that classifies as good as the best linear classifier coupled with the best low-dimensional subspace in which the data resides. A direct implication is that our algorithm can linearly (and non-linearly through kernels) classify provably as well as the best classifier that has access to the full data."}
{"text": "  Sparsity-inducing penalties are useful tools to design multiclass support vector machines (SVMs). In this paper, we propose a convex optimization approach for efficiently and exactly solving the multiclass SVM learning problem involving a sparse regularization and the multiclass hinge loss formulated by Crammer and Singer. We provide two algorithms: the first one dealing with the hinge loss as a penalty term, and the other one addressing the case when the hinge loss is enforced through a constraint. The related convex optimization problems can be efficiently solved thanks to the flexibility offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms and epigraphical splitting techniques. Experiments carried out on several datasets demonstrate the interest of considering the exact expression of the hinge loss rather than a smooth approximation. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms w.r.t. several state-of-the-art methods is also assessed through comparisons of execution times."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose the problem of optimizing multivariate performance measures from multi-view data, and an effective method to solve it. This problem has two features: the data points are presented by multiple views, and the target of learning is to optimize complex multivariate performance measures. We propose to learn a linear discriminant functions for each view, and combine them to construct a overall multivariate mapping function for mult-view data. To learn the parameters of the linear dis- criminant functions of different views to optimize multivariate performance measures, we formulate a optimization problem. In this problem, we propose to minimize the complexity of the linear discriminant functions of each view, encourage the consistences of the responses of different views over the same data points, and minimize the upper boundary of a given multivariate performance measure. To optimize this problem, we employ the cutting-plane method in an iterative algorithm. In each iteration, we update a set of constrains, and optimize the mapping function parameter of each view one by one."}
{"text": "  Using nonparametric methods has been increasingly explored in Bayesian hierarchical modeling as a way to increase model flexibility. Although the field shows a lot of promise, inference in many models, including Hierachical Dirichlet Processes (HDP), remain prohibitively slow. One promising path forward is to exploit the submodularity inherent in Indian Buffet Process (IBP) to derive near-optimal solutions in polynomial time. In this work, I will present a brief tutorial on Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially as they are applied to topic modeling. I will show a comparison between different non-parametric models and the current state-of-the-art parametric model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)."}
{"text": "  Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of a wide variety of machine learning models. The success of machine learning has led practitioners in diverse real-world settings to learn classifiers for practical problems. As machine learning becomes commonplace, Bayesian optimization becomes an attractive method for practitioners to automate the process of classifier hyper-parameter tuning. A key observation is that the data used for tuning models in these settings is often sensitive. Certain data such as genetic predisposition, personal email statistics, and car accident history, if not properly private, may be at risk of being inferred from Bayesian optimization outputs. To address this, we introduce methods for releasing the best hyper-parameters and classifier accuracy privately. Leveraging the strong theoretical guarantees of differential privacy and known Bayesian optimization convergence bounds, we prove that under a GP assumption these private quantities are also near-optimal. Finally, even if this assumption is not satisfied, we can use different smoothness guarantees to protect privacy."}

{"text": "  In [1], a clustering algorithm was given to find the centers of clusters quickly. However, the accuracy of this algorithm heavily depend on the threshold value of d-c. Furthermore, [1] has not provided any efficient way to select the threshold value of d-c, that is, one can have to estimate the value of d_c depend on one's subjective experience. In this paper, based on the data field [2], we propose a new way to automatically extract the threshold value of d_c from the original data set by using the potential entropy of data field. For any data set to be clustered, the most reasonable value of d_c can be objectively calculated from the data set by using our proposed method. The same experiments in [1] are redone with our proposed method on the same experimental data set used in [1], the results of which shows that the problem to calculate the threshold value of d_c in [1] has been solved by using our method."}
{"text": "  In this paper we investigate the usage of regularized correntropy framework for learning of classifiers from noisy labels. The class label predictors learned by minimizing transitional loss functions are sensitive to the noisy and outlying labels of training samples, because the transitional loss functions are equally applied to all the samples. To solve this problem, we propose to learn the class label predictors by maximizing the correntropy between the predicted labels and the true labels of the training samples, under the regularized Maximum Correntropy Criteria (MCC) framework. Moreover, we regularize the predictor parameter to control the complexity of the predictor. The learning problem is formulated by an objective function considering the parameter regularization and MCC simultaneously. By optimizing the objective function alternately, we develop a novel predictor learning algorithm. The experiments on two chal- lenging pattern classification tasks show that it significantly outperforms the machines with transitional loss functions."}

We focus on the problem of constructing adaptive and honest confidence sets for the sparse parameter \\theta, i.e. we want to construct a confidence set for theta that contains theta with high probability, and that is as small as possible. The l_2 diameter of a such confidence set should depend on the sparsity S of \\theta - the larger S, the wider the confidence set. However, in practice, S is unknown. This paper focuses on constructing a confidence set for \\theta which contains \\theta with high probability, whose diameter is adaptive to the unknown sparsity S, and which is implementable in practice."}
{"text": "  Graphical models provide powerful tools to uncover complicated patterns in multivariate data and are commonly used in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we introduce the R package BDgraph which performs Bayesian structure learning for general undirected graphical models (decomposable and non-decomposable) with continuous, discrete, and mixed variables. The package efficiently implements recent improvements in the Bayesian literature, including that of Mohammadi and Wit (2015) and Dobra and Mohammadi (2018). To speed up computations, the computationally intensive tasks have been implemented in C++ and interfaced with R, and the package has parallel computing capabilities. In addition, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as several multivariate datasets taken from the literature and used to describe the package capabilities. The paper includes a brief overview of the statistical methods which have been implemented in the package. The main part of the paper explains how to use the package. Furthermore, we illustrate the package's functionality in both real and artificial examples."}
{"text": "  We are motivated by problems that arise in a number of applications such as Online Marketing and Explosives detection, where the observations are usually modeled using Poisson statistics. We model each observation as a Poisson random variable whose mean is a sparse linear superposition of known patterns. Unlike many conventional problems observations here are not identically distributed since they are associated with different sensing modalities. We analyze the performance of a Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder, which for our Poisson setting involves a non-linear optimization but yet is computationally tractable. We derive fundamental sample complexity bounds for sparse recovery when the measurements are contaminated with Poisson noise. In contrast to the least-squares linear regression setting with Gaussian noise, we observe that in addition to sparsity, the scale of the parameters also fundamentally impacts $\\ell_2$ error in the Poisson setting. We show tightness of our upper bounds both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we derive a minimax matching lower bound on the mean-squared error and show that our constrained ML decoder is minimax optimal for this regime."}
{"text": "  Most of the existing classification methods are aimed at minimization of empirical risk (through some simple point-based error measured with loss function) with added regularization. We propose to approach this problem in a more information theoretic way by investigating applicability of entropy measures as a classification model objective function. We focus on quadratic Renyi's entropy and connected Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence which leads to the construction of Extreme Entropy Machines (EEM).   The main contribution of this paper is proposing a model based on the information theoretic concepts which on the one hand shows new, entropic perspective on known linear classifiers and on the other leads to a construction of very robust method competetitive with the state of the art non-information theoretic ones (including Support Vector Machines and Extreme Learning Machines).   Evaluation on numerous problems spanning from small, simple ones from UCI repository to the large (hundreads of thousands of samples) extremely unbalanced (up to 100:1 classes' ratios) datasets shows wide applicability of the EEM in real life problems and that it scales well."}
{"text": "  A statistical test of independence may be constructed using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a test statistic. The HSIC is defined as the distance between the embedding of the joint distribution, and the embedding of the product of the marginals, in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). It has previously been shown that when the kernel used in defining the joint embedding is characteristic (that is, the embedding of the joint distribution to the feature space is injective), then the HSIC-based test is consistent. In particular, it is sufficient for the product of kernels on the individual domains to be characteristic on the joint domain. In this note, it is established via a result of Lyons (2013) that HSIC-based independence tests are consistent when kernels on the marginals are characteristic on their respective domains, even when the product of kernels is not characteristic on the joint domain."}
{"text": "  This paper introduces and develops a novel variable importance score function in the context of ensemble learning and demonstrates its appeal both theoretically and empirically. Our proposed score function is simple and more straightforward than its counterpart proposed in the context of random forest, and by avoiding permutations, it is by design computationally more efficient than the random forest variable importance function. Just like the random forest variable importance function, our score handles both regression and classification seamlessly. One of the distinct advantage of our proposed score is the fact that it offers a natural cut off at zero, with all the positive scores indicating importance and significance, while the negative scores are deemed indications of insignificance. An extra advantage of our proposed score lies in the fact it works very well beyond ensemble of trees and can seamlessly be used with any base learners in the random subspace learning context. Our examples, both simulated and real, demonstrate that our proposed score does compete mostly favorably with the random forest score."}
{"text": "  Semi-supervised clustering is an very important topic in machine learning and computer vision. The key challenge of this problem is how to learn a metric, such that the instances sharing the same label are more likely close to each other on the embedded space. However, little attention has been paid to learn better representations when the data lie on non-linear manifold. Fortunately, deep learning has led to great success on feature learning recently. Inspired by the advances of deep learning, we propose a deep transductive semi-supervised maximum margin clustering approach. More specifically, given pairwise constraints, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a non-linear mapping under maximum margin framework for clustering analysis. Thus, our model unifies transductive learning, feature learning and maximum margin techniques in the semi-supervised clustering framework. We pretrain the deep network structure with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) layer by layer greedily, and optimize our objective function with gradient descent. By checking the most violated constraints, our approach updates the model parameters through error backpropagation, in which deep features are learned automatically. The experimental results shows that our model is significantly better than the state of the art on semi-supervised clustering."}
{"text": "  In many applications data is naturally presented in terms of orderings of some basic elements or symbols. Reasoning about such data requires a notion of similarity capable of handling sequences of different lengths. In this paper we describe a family of Mercer kernel functions for such sequentially structured data. The family is characterized by a decomposable structure in terms of symbol-level and structure-level similarities, representing a specific combination of kernels which allows for efficient computation. We provide an experimental evaluation on sequential classification tasks comparing kernels from our family of kernels to a state of the art sequence kernel called the Global Alignment kernel which has been shown to outperform Dynamic Time Warping"}
{"text": "  Support vector machines (SVM) can classify data sets along highly non-linear decision boundaries because of the kernel-trick. This expressiveness comes at a price: During test-time, the SVM classifier needs to compute the kernel inner-product between a test sample and all support vectors. With large training data sets, the time required for this computation can be substantial. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing algorithm, which compresses the learned SVM model by reducing and optimizing support vectors. We evaluate our algorithm on several medium-scaled real-world data sets, demonstrating that it maintains high test accuracy while reducing the test-time evaluation cost by several orders of magnitude---in some cases from hours to seconds. It is fair to say that most of the work in this paper was previously been invented by Burges and Sch\\\"olkopf almost 20 years ago. For most of the time during which we conducted this research, we were unaware of this prior work. However, in the past two decades, computing power has increased drastically, and we can therefore provide empirical insights that were not possible in their original paper."}
{"text": "  Coronary heart disease (CHD) caused by hardening of artery walls due to cholesterol known as atherosclerosis is responsible for large number of deaths world-wide. The disease progression is slow, asymptomatic and may lead to sudden cardiac arrest, stroke or myocardial infraction. Presently, imaging techniques are being employed to understand the molecular and metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques to estimate the risk. Though imaging methods are able to provide some information on plaque metabolism they lack the required resolution and sensitivity for detection. In this paper we consider the clinical observations and habits of individuals for predicting the risk factors of CHD. The identification of risk factors helps in stratifying patients for further intensive tests such as nuclear imaging or coronary angiography. We present a novel approach for predicting the risk factors of atherosclerosis with an in-built imputation algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We compare the performance of our methodology with other machine learning techniques on STULONG dataset which is based on longitudinal study of middle aged individuals lasting for twenty years. Our methodology powered by PSO search has identified physical inactivity as one of the risk factor for the onset of atherosclerosis in addition to other already known factors. The decision rules extracted by our methodology are able to predict the risk factors with an accuracy of $99.73%$ which is higher than the accuracies obtained by application of the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques presently being employed in the identification of atherosclerosis risk studies."}
{"text": "  Applications involving dictionary learning, non-negative matrix factorization, subspace clustering, and parallel factor tensor decomposition tasks motivate well algorithms for per-block-convex and non-smooth optimization problems. By leveraging the stochastic approximation paradigm and first-order acceleration schemes, this paper develops an online and modular learning algorithm for a large class of non-convex data models, where convexity is manifested only per-block of variables whenever the rest of them are held fixed. The advocated algorithm incurs computational complexity that scales linearly with the number of unknowns. Under minimal assumptions on the cost functions of the composite optimization task, without bounding constraints on the optimization variables, or any explicit information on bounds of Lipschitz coefficients, the expected cost evaluated online at the resultant iterates is provably convergent with quadratic rate to an accumulation point of the (per-block) minima, while subgradients of the expected cost asymptotically vanish in the mean-squared sense. The merits of the general approach are demonstrated in two online learning setups: (i) Robust linear regression using a sparsity-cognizant total least-squares criterion; and (ii) semi-supervised dictionary learning for network-wide link load tracking and imputation with missing entries. Numerical tests on synthetic and real data highlight the potential of the proposed framework for streaming data analytics by demonstrating superior performance over block coordinate descent, and reduced complexity relative to the popular alternating-direction method of multipliers."}
{"text": "  This study presents a divide-and-conquer (DC) approach based on feature space decomposition for classification. When large-scale datasets are present, typical approaches usually employed truncated kernel methods on the feature space or DC approaches on the sample space. However, this did not guarantee separability between classes, owing to overfitting. To overcome such problems, this work proposes a novel DC approach on feature spaces consisting of three steps. Firstly, we divide the feature space into several subspaces using the decomposition method proposed in this paper. Subsequently, these feature subspaces are sent into individual local classifiers for training. Finally, the outcomes of local classifiers are fused together to generate the final classification results. Experiments on large-scale datasets are carried out for performance evaluation. The results show that the error rates of the proposed DC method decreased comparing with the state-of-the-art fast SVM solvers, e.g., reducing error rates by 10.53% and 7.53% on RCV1 and covtype datasets respectively."}
{"text": "  Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) are high-dimensional vector representations of objects (eg., words, image parts), relations (eg., sentence structures), and sequences for use with machine learning algorithms. They consist of a vector addition operator for representing a collection of unordered objects, a Binding operator for associating groups of objects, and a methodology for encoding complex structures.   We first develop Constraints that machine learning imposes upon VSAs: for example, similar structures must be represented by similar vectors. The constraints suggest that current VSAs should represent phrases (\"The smart Brazilian girl\") by binding sums of terms, in addition to simply binding the terms directly.   We show that matrix multiplication can be used as the binding operator for a VSA, and that matrix elements can be chosen at random. A consequence for living systems is that binding is mathematically possible without the need to specify, in advance, precise neuron-to-neuron connection properties for large numbers of synapses.   A VSA that incorporates these ideas, MBAT (Matrix Binding of Additive Terms), is described that satisfies all Constraints.   With respect to machine learning, for some types of problems appropriate VSA representations permit us to prove learnability, rather than relying on simulations. We also propose dividing machine (and neural) learning and representation into three Stages, with differing roles for learning in each stage.   For neural modeling, we give \"representational reasons\" for nervous systems to have many recurrent connections, as well as for the importance of phrases in language processing.   Sizing simulations and analyses suggest that VSAs in general, and MBAT in particular, are ready for real-world applications."}
{"text": "  AB-testing is a very popular technique in web companies since it makes it possible to accurately predict the impact of a modification with the simplicity of a random split across users. One of the critical aspects of an AB-test is its duration and it is important to reliably compute confidence intervals associated with the metric of interest to know when to stop the test. In this paper, we define a clean mathematical framework to model the AB-test process. We then propose three algorithms based on bootstrapping and on the central limit theorem to compute reliable confidence intervals which extend to other metrics than the common probabilities of success. They apply to both absolute and relative increments of the most used comparison metrics, including the number of occurrences of a particular event and a click-through rate implying a ratio."}
{"text": "  We propose a batchwise monotone algorithm for dictionary learning. Unlike the state-of-the-art dictionary learning algorithms which impose sparsity constraints on a sample-by-sample basis, we instead treat the samples as a batch, and impose the sparsity constraint on the whole. The benefit of batchwise optimization is that the non-zeros can be better allocated across the samples, leading to a better approximation of the whole. To accomplish this, we propose procedures to switch non-zeros in both rows and columns in the support of the coefficient matrix to reduce the reconstruction error. We prove in the proposed support switching procedure the objective of the algorithm, i.e., the reconstruction error, decreases monotonically and converges. Furthermore, we introduce a block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that also operates on sample batches to provide a warm start. Experiments on both natural image patches and UCI data sets show that the proposed algorithm produces a better approximation with the same sparsity levels compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms."}
{"text": "  We often encounter situations in which an experimenter wants to find, by sequential experimentation, $x_{max} = \\arg\\max_{x} f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a (possibly unknown) function of a well controllable variable $x$. Taking inspiration from physics and engineering, we have designed a new method to address this problem. In this paper, we first introduce the method in continuous time, and then present two algorithms for use in sequential experiments. Through a series of simulation studies, we show that the method is effective for finding maxima of unknown functions by experimentation, even when the maximum of the functions drifts or when the signal to noise ratio is low."}
{"text": "  Laplacian mixture models identify overlapping regions of influence in unlabeled graph and network data in a scalable and computationally efficient way, yielding useful low-dimensional representations. By combining Laplacian eigenspace and finite mixture modeling methods, they provide probabilistic or fuzzy dimensionality reductions or domain decompositions for a variety of input data types, including mixture distributions, feature vectors, and graphs or networks. Provable optimal recovery using the algorithm is analytically shown for a nontrivial class of cluster graphs. Heuristic approximations for scalable high-performance implementations are described and empirically tested. Connections to PageRank and community detection in network analysis demonstrate the wide applicability of this approach. The origins of fuzzy spectral methods, beginning with generalized heat or diffusion equations in physics, are reviewed and summarized. Comparisons to other dimensionality reduction and clustering methods for challenging unsupervised machine learning problems are also discussed."}
{"text": "  Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied problems in statistics and machine learning that have found many applications in science and engineering. However, exact inference is intractable in general graphical models, which suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a collection of random variables within some tractable family of graphical models. In this paper, we focus on the class of planar Ising models, for which exact inference is tractable using techniques of statistical physics. Based on these techniques and recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method in simulations and for the application of modeling senate voting records."}
{"text": "  The sparse representation classifier (SRC) has been utilized in various classification problems, which makes use of L1 minimization and works well for image recognition satisfying a subspace assumption. In this paper we propose a new implementation of SRC via screening, establish its equivalence to the original SRC under regularity conditions, and prove its classification consistency under a latent subspace model and contamination. The results are demonstrated via simulations and real data experiments, where the new algorithm achieves comparable numerical performance and significantly faster."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel sparse tensor decomposition method, namely Tensor Truncated Power (TTP) method, that incorporates variable selection into the estimation of decomposition components. The sparsity is achieved via an efficient truncation step embedded in the tensor power iteration. Our method applies to a broad family of high dimensional latent variable models, including high dimensional Gaussian mixture and mixtures of sparse regressions. A thorough theoretical investigation is further conducted. In particular, we show that the final decomposition estimator is guaranteed to achieve a local statistical rate, and further strengthen it to the global statistical rate by introducing a proper initialization procedure. In high dimensional regimes, the obtained statistical rate significantly improves those shown in the existing non-sparse decomposition methods. The empirical advantages of TTP are confirmed in extensive simulated results and two real applications of click-through rate prediction and high-dimensional gene clustering."}
{"text": "  Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) have found many applications in density estimation and data clustering. However, the model does not adapt well to curved and strongly nonlinear data. Recently there appeared an improvement called AcaGMM (Active curve axis Gaussian Mixture Model), which fits Gaussians along curves using an EM-like (Expectation Maximization) approach.   Using the ideas standing behind AcaGMM, we build an alternative active function model of clustering, which has some advantages over AcaGMM. In particular it is naturally defined in arbitrary dimensions and enables an easy adaptation to clustering of complicated datasets along the predefined family of functions. Moreover, it does not need external methods to determine the number of clusters as it automatically reduces the number of groups on-line."}
{"text": "  Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) are probability distributions over vector-valued functions, and have been previously used for multi-output regression and for multi-class classification. A less explored facet of the multi-output Gaussian process is that it can be used as a generative model for vector-valued random fields in the context of pattern recognition. As a generative model, the multi-output GP is able to handle vector-valued functions with continuous inputs, as opposed, for example, to hidden Markov models. It also offers the ability to model multivariate random functions with high dimensional inputs. In this report, we use a discriminative training criteria known as Minimum Classification Error to fit the parameters of a multi-output Gaussian process. We compare the performance of generative training and discriminative training of MOGP in emotion recognition, activity recognition, and face recognition. We also compare the proposed methodology against hidden Markov models trained in a generative and in a discriminative way."}
{"text": "  In various applications involving hidden Markov models (HMMs), some of the hidden states are aliased, having identical output distributions. The minimality, identifiability and learnability of such aliased HMMs have been long standing problems, with only partial solutions provided thus far. In this paper we focus on parametric-output HMMs, whose output distributions come from a parametric family, and that have exactly two aliased states. For this class, we present a complete characterization of their minimality and identifiability. Furthermore, for a large family of parametric output distributions, we derive computationally efficient and statistically consistent algorithms to detect the presence of aliasing and learn the aliased HMM transition and emission parameters. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by several simulations."}
{"text": "  We propose a new algorithm for minimizing regularized empirical loss: Stochastic Dual Newton Ascent (SDNA). Our method is dual in nature: in each iteration we update a random subset of the dual variables. However, unlike existing methods such as stochastic dual coordinate ascent, SDNA is capable of utilizing all curvature information contained in the examples, which leads to striking improvements in both theory and practice - sometimes by orders of magnitude. In the special case when an L2-regularizer is used in the primal, the dual problem is a concave quadratic maximization problem plus a separable term. In this regime, SDNA in each step solves a proximal subproblem involving a random principal submatrix of the Hessian of the quadratic function; whence the name of the method. If, in addition, the loss functions are quadratic, our method can be interpreted as a novel variant of the recently introduced Iterative Hessian Sketch."}
{"text": "  There has been an explosion of interest in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) during the past two decades. Naturally, this has been accompanied by many major advances in the understanding of the human connectome. These advances have served to pose novel challenges as well as open new avenues for research. One of the most promising and exciting of such avenues is the study of functional MRI in real-time. Such studies have recently gained momentum and have been applied in a wide variety of settings; ranging from training of healthy subjects to self-regulate neuronal activity to being suggested as potential treatments for clinical populations. To date, the vast majority of these studies have focused on a single region at a time. This is due in part to the many challenges faced when estimating dynamic functional connectivity networks in real-time. In this work we propose a novel methodology with which to accurately track changes in functional connectivity networks in real-time. We adapt the recently proposed SINGLE algorithm for estimating sparse and temporally homo- geneous dynamic networks to be applicable in real-time. The proposed method is applied to motor task data from the Human Connectome Project as well as to real-time data ob- tained while exploring a virtual environment. We show that the algorithm is able to estimate significant task-related changes in network structure quickly enough to be useful in future brain-computer interface applications."}
{"text": "  The minimization of the logistic loss is a popular approach to batch supervised learning. Our paper starts from the surprising observation that, when fitting linear (or kernelized) classifiers, the minimization of the logistic loss is \\textit{equivalent} to the minimization of an exponential \\textit{rado}-loss computed (i) over transformed data that we call Rademacher observations (rados), and (ii) over the \\textit{same} classifier as the one of the logistic loss. Thus, a classifier learnt from rados can be \\textit{directly} used to classify \\textit{observations}. We provide a learning algorithm over rados with boosting-compliant convergence rates on the \\textit{logistic loss} (computed over examples). Experiments on domains with up to millions of examples, backed up by theoretical arguments, display that learning over a small set of random rados can challenge the state of the art that learns over the \\textit{complete} set of examples. We show that rados comply with various privacy requirements that make them good candidates for machine learning in a privacy framework. We give several algebraic, geometric and computational hardness results on reconstructing examples from rados. We also show how it is possible to craft, and efficiently learn from, rados in a differential privacy framework. Tests reveal that learning from differentially private rados can compete with learning from random rados, and hence with batch learning from examples, achieving non-trivial privacy vs accuracy tradeoffs."}
{"text": "  Careful tuning of a regularization parameter is indispensable in many machine learning tasks because it has a significant impact on generalization performances. Nevertheless, current practice of regularization parameter tuning is more of an art than a science, e.g., it is hard to tell how many grid-points would be needed in cross-validation (CV) for obtaining a solution with sufficiently small CV error. In this paper we propose a novel framework for computing a lower bound of the CV errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which we call regularization path of CV error lower bounds. The proposed framework can be used for providing a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions in the sense that how far the CV error of the current best solution could be away from best possible CV error in the entire range of the regularization parameters. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that a theoretically guaranteed a choice of regularization parameter in the above sense is possible with reasonable computational costs."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes a unified framework to quantify local and global inferential uncertainty for high dimensional nonparanormal graphical models. In particular, we consider the problems of testing the presence of a single edge and constructing a uniform confidence subgraph. Due to the presence of unknown marginal transformations, we propose a pseudo likelihood based inferential approach. In sharp contrast to the existing high dimensional score test method, our method is free of tuning parameters given an initial estimator, and extends the scope of the existing likelihood based inferential framework. Furthermore, we propose a U-statistic multiplier bootstrap method to construct the confidence subgraph. We show that the constructed subgraph is contained in the true graph with probability greater than a given nominal level. Compared with existing methods for constructing confidence subgraphs, our method does not rely on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions. The theoretical properties of the proposed inferential methods are verified by thorough numerical experiments and real data analysis."}
{"text": "  We present a mathematical construction for the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that doesn't require specifying the number of hidden units. In fact, the hidden layer size is adaptive and can grow during training. This is obtained by first extending the RBM to be sensitive to the ordering of its hidden units. Then, thanks to a carefully chosen definition of the energy function, we show that the limit of infinitely many hidden units is well defined. As with RBM, approximate maximum likelihood training can be performed, resulting in an algorithm that naturally and adaptively adds trained hidden units during learning. We empirically study the behaviour of this infinite RBM, showing that its performance is competitive to that of the RBM, while not requiring the tuning of a hidden layer size."}
{"text": "  We present a novel adaptive random subspace learning algorithm (RSSL) for prediction purpose. This new framework is flexible where it can be adapted with any learning technique. In this paper, we tested the algorithm for regression and classification problems. In addition, we provide a variety of weighting schemes to increase the robustness of the developed algorithm. These different wighting flavors were evaluated on simulated as well as on real-world data sets considering the cases where the ratio between features (attributes) and instances (samples) is large and vice versa. The framework of the new algorithm consists of many stages: first, calculate the weights of all features on the data set using the correlation coefficient and F-statistic statistical measurements. Second, randomly draw n samples with replacement from the data set. Third, perform regular bootstrap sampling (bagging). Fourth, draw without replacement the indices of the chosen variables. The decision was taken based on the heuristic subspacing scheme. Fifth, call base learners and build the model. Sixth, use the model for prediction purpose on test set of the data. The results show the advancement of the adaptive RSSL algorithm in most of the cases compared with the synonym (conventional) machine learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  We study online boosting, the task of converting any weak online learner into a strong online learner. Based on a novel and natural definition of weak online learnability, we develop two online boosting algorithms. The first algorithm is an online version of boost-by-majority. By proving a matching lower bound, we show that this algorithm is essentially optimal in terms of the number of weak learners and the sample complexity needed to achieve a specified accuracy. This optimal algorithm is not adaptive however. Using tools from online loss minimization, we derive an adaptive online boosting algorithm that is also parameter-free, but not optimal. Both algorithms work with base learners that can handle example importance weights directly, as well as by rejection sampling examples with probability defined by the booster. Results are complemented with an extensive experimental study."}

{"text": "  Modeling the dependence between outputs is a fundamental challenge in multilabel classification. In this work we show that a generic regularized nonlinearity mapping independent predictions to joint predictions is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark problems. Crucially, we compute the joint predictions without ever obtaining any independent predictions, while incorporating low-rank and smoothness regularization. We achieve this by leveraging randomized algorithms for matrix decomposition and kernel approximation. Furthermore, our techniques are applicable to the multiclass setting. We apply our method to a variety of multiclass and multilabel data sets, obtaining state-of-the-art results."}
{"text": "  Recent studies reveal that a deep neural network can learn transferable features which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However, as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this paper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation scenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with statistical guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel embedding. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed architecture yields state-of-the-art image classification error rates on standard domain adaptation benchmarks."}
{"text": "  To scale Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets we introduce the robust Bayesian Committee Machine (rBCM), a practical and scalable product-of-experts model for large-scale distributed GP regression. Unlike state-of-the-art sparse GP approximations, the rBCM is conceptually simple and does not rely on inducing or variational parameters. The key idea is to recursively distribute computations to independent computational units and, subsequently, recombine them to form an overall result. Efficient closed-form inference allows for straightforward parallelisation and distributed computations with a small memory footprint. The rBCM is independent of the computational graph and can be used on heterogeneous computing infrastructures, ranging from laptops to clusters. With sufficient computing resources our distributed GP model can handle arbitrarily large data sets."}
{"text": "  Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters."}
{"text": "  The labeled stochastic block model is a random graph model representing networks with community structure and interactions of multiple types. In its simplest form, it consists of two communities of approximately equal size, and the edges are drawn and labeled at random with probability depending on whether their two endpoints belong to the same community or not.   It has been conjectured in \\cite{Heimlicher12} that correlated reconstruction (i.e.\\ identification of a partition correlated with the true partition into the underlying communities) would be feasible if and only if a model parameter exceeds a threshold. We prove one half of this conjecture, i.e., reconstruction is impossible when below the threshold. In the positive direction, we introduce a weighted graph to exploit the label information. With a suitable choice of weight function, we show that when above the threshold by a specific constant, reconstruction is achieved by (1) minimum bisection, (2) a semidefinite relaxation of minimum bisection, and (3) a spectral method combined with removal of edges incident to vertices of high degree. Furthermore, we show that hypothesis testing between the labeled stochastic block model and the labeled Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph model exhibits a phase transition at the conjectured reconstruction threshold."}
{"text": "  For the challenging task of modeling multivariate time series, we propose a new class of models that use dependent Mat\\'ern processes to capture the underlying structure of data, explain their interdependencies, and predict their unknown values. Although similar models have been proposed in the econometric, statistics, and machine learning literature, our approach has several advantages that distinguish it from existing methods: 1) it is flexible to provide high prediction accuracy, yet its complexity is controlled to avoid overfitting; 2) its interpretability separates it from black-box methods; 3) finally, its computational efficiency makes it scalable for high-dimensional time series. In this paper, we use several simulated and real data sets to illustrate these advantages. We will also briefly discuss some extensions of our model."}
{"text": "  Metric learning has been shown to be highly effective to improve the performance of nearest neighbor classification. In this paper, we address the problem of metric learning for Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices such as covariance matrices, which arise in many real-world applications. Naively using standard Mahalanobis metric learning methods under the Euclidean geometry for SPD matrices is not appropriate, because the difference of SPD matrices can be a non-SPD matrix and thus the obtained solution can be uninterpretable. To cope with this problem, we propose to use a properly parameterized LogEuclidean distance and optimize the metric with respect to kernel-target alignment, which is a supervised criterion for kernel learning. Then the resulting non-trivial optimization problem is solved by utilizing the Riemannian geometry. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of our LogEuclidean metric learning algorithm on real-world classification tasks for EEG signals and texture patches."}
{"text": "  Distributed optimization methods for large-scale machine learning suffer from a communication bottleneck. It is difficult to reduce this bottleneck while still efficiently and accurately aggregating partial work from different machines. In this paper, we present a novel generalization of the recent communication-efficient primal-dual framework (CoCoA) for distributed optimization. Our framework, CoCoA+, allows for additive combination of local updates to the global parameters at each iteration, whereas previous schemes with convergence guarantees only allow conservative averaging. We give stronger (primal-dual) convergence rate guarantees for both CoCoA as well as our new variants, and generalize the theory for both methods to cover non-smooth convex loss functions. We provide an extensive experimental comparison that shows the markedly improved performance of CoCoA+ on several real-world distributed datasets, especially when scaling up the number of machines."}
{"text": "  Stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which visits only one sample or a mini-batch of samples each time, has recently been proved to achieve better performance than batch ADMM. However, most stochastic methods can only achieve a convergence rate $O(1/\\sqrt T)$ on general convex problems,where T is the number of iterations. Hence, these methods are not scalable with respect to convergence rate (computation cost). There exists only one stochastic method, called SA-ADMM, which can achieve convergence rate $O(1/T)$ on general convex problems. However, an extra memory is needed for SA-ADMM to store the historic gradients on all samples, and thus it is not scalable with respect to storage cost. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called scalable stochastic ADMM(SCAS-ADMM), for large-scale optimization and learning problems. Without the need to store the historic gradients, SCAS-ADMM can achieve the same convergence rate $O(1/T)$ as the best stochastic method SA-ADMM and batch ADMM on general convex problems. Experiments on graph-guided fused lasso show that SCAS-ADMM can achieve state-of-the-art performance in real applications"}

{"text": "  Reciprocating interactions represent a central feature of all human exchanges. They have been the target of various recent experiments, with healthy participants and psychiatric populations engaging as dyads in multi-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behaviour in such exchanges involves complexities related to each agent's preference for equity with their partner, beliefs about the partner's appetite for equity, beliefs about the partner's model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise account of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what underlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various complexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert observations of behavioural choices. We use generated behaviour to elucidate the richness and sophistication of interactive inference."}

{"text": "  Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks."}
{"text": "  We present a deep learning approach to estimation of the bead parameters in welding tasks. Our model is based on a four-hidden-layer neural network architecture. More specifically, the first three hidden layers of this architecture utilize Sigmoid function to produce their respective intermediate outputs. On the other hand, the last hidden layer uses a linear transformation to generate the final output of this architecture. This transforms our deep network architecture from a classifier to a non-linear regression model. We compare the performance of our deep network with a selected number of results in the literature to show a considerable improvement in reducing the errors in estimation of these values. Furthermore, we show its scalability on estimating the weld bead parameters with same level of accuracy on combination of datasets that pertain to different welding techniques. This is a nontrivial result that is counter-intuitive to the general belief in this field of research."}
{"text": "  We present a novel algorithm, Westfall-Young light, for detecting patterns, such as itemsets and subgraphs, which are statistically significantly enriched in one of two classes. Our method corrects rigorously for multiple hypothesis testing and correlations between patterns through the Westfall-Young permutation procedure, which empirically estimates the null distribution of pattern frequencies in each class via permutations. In our experiments, Westfall-Young light dramatically outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach in terms of both runtime and memory efficiency on popular real-world benchmark datasets for pattern mining. The key to this efficiency is that unlike all existing methods, our algorithm neither needs to solve the underlying frequent itemset mining problem anew for each permutation nor needs to store the occurrence list of all frequent patterns. Westfall-Young light opens the door to significant pattern mining on large datasets that previously led to prohibitive runtime or memory costs."}
{"text": "  We introduce and develop a novel approach to outlier detection based on adaptation of random subspace learning. Our proposed method handles both high-dimension low-sample size and traditional low-dimensional high-sample size datasets. Essentially, we avoid the computational bottleneck of techniques like minimum covariance determinant (MCD) by computing the needed determinants and associated measures in much lower dimensional subspaces. Both theoretical and computational development of our approach reveal that it is computationally more efficient than the regularized methods in high-dimensional low-sample size, and often competes favorably with existing methods as far as the percentage of correct outlier detection is concerned."}
{"text": "  The organizer of a machine learning competition faces the problem of maintaining an accurate leaderboard that faithfully represents the quality of the best submission of each competing team. What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of re-submission.   In this work, we introduce a notion of \"leaderboard accuracy\" tailored to the format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called \"the Ladder\" and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from an actual competition hosted by Kaggle.   Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a completely parameter-free variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a real competition with no tuning required whatsoever."}
{"text": "  Errors in data are usually unwelcome and so some means to correct them is useful. However, it is difficult to define, detect or correct errors in an unsupervised way. Here, we train a deep neural network to re-synthesize its inputs at its output layer for a given class of data.

In this paper, we study the problem of inferring individual preferences, arising in the context of making personalized recommendations. In particular, we assume that there are $n$ users of $r$ types; users of the same type provide similar pairwise comparisons for $m$ items according to the Bradley-Terry model. We propose an efficient algorithm that accurately estimates the individual preferences for almost all users, if there are $r \\max \\{m, n\\}\\log m \\log^2 n$ pairwise comparisons per type, which is near optimal in sample complexity when $r$ only grows logarithmically with $m$ or $n$. Our algorithm has three steps: first, for each user, compute the \\emph{net-win} vector which is a projection of its $\\binom{m}{2}$-dimensional vector of pairwise comparisons onto an $m$-dimensional linear subspace; second, cluster the users based on the net-win vectors; third, estimate a single preference for each cluster separately. The net-win vectors are much less noisy than the high dimensional vectors of pairwise comparisons and clustering is more accurate after the projection as confirmed by numerical experiments. Moreover, we show that, when a cluster is only approximately correct, the maximum likelihood estimation for the Bradley-Terry model is still close to the true preference."}
{"text": "  The majority of machine learning algorithms assumes that objects are represented as vectors. But often the objects we want to learn on are more naturally represented by other data structures such as sequences and time series. For these representations many standard learning algorithms are unavailable. We generalize gradient-based learning algorithms to time series under dynamic time warping. To this end, we introduce elastic functions, which extend functions on time series to matrix spaces. Necessary conditions are presented under which generalized gradient learning on time series is consistent. We indicate how results carry over to arbitrary elastic distance functions and to sequences consisting of symbolic elements. Specifically, four linear classifiers are extended to time series under dynamic time warping and applied to benchmark datasets. Results indicate that generalized gradient learning via elastic functions have the potential to complement the state-of-the-art in statistical pattern recognition on time series."}
{"text": "  Motivated by the problem of computing investment portfolio weightings we investigate various methods of clustering as alternatives to traditional mean-variance approaches. Such methods can have significant benefits from a practical point of view since they remove the need to invert a sample covariance matrix, which can suffer from estimation error and will almost certainly be non-stationary. The general idea is to find groups of assets which share similar return characteristics over time and treat each group as a single composite asset. We then apply inverse volatility weightings to these new composite assets. In the course of our investigation we devise a method of clustering based on triangular potentials and we present associated theoretical results as well as various examples based on synthetic data."}
{"text": "  Supervised classification approaches can predict labels for unknown data because of the supervised training process. The success of classification is heavily dependent on the labeled training data. Differently, clustering is effective in revealing the aggregation property of unlabeled data, but the performance of most clustering methods is limited by the absence of labeled data. In real applications, however, it is time-consuming and sometimes impossible to obtain labeled data. The combination of clustering and classification is a promising and active approach which can largely improve the performance. In this paper, we propose an innovative and effective clustering framework based on self-adaptive labeling (CSAL) which integrates clustering and classification on unlabeled data. Clustering is first employed to partition data and a certain proportion of clustered data are selected by our proposed labeling approach for training classifiers. In order to refine the trained classifiers, an iterative process of Expectation-Maximization algorithm is devised into the proposed clustering framework CSAL. Experiments are conducted on publicly data sets to test different combinations of clustering algorithms and classification models as well as various training data labeling methods. The experimental results show that our approach along with the self-adaptive method outperforms other methods."}
{"text": "  In this paper we study the problem of learning from multiple modal data for purpose of document classification. In this problem, each document is composed two different modals of data, i.e., an image and a text. Cross-modal factor analysis (CFA) has been proposed to project the two different modals of data to a shared data space, so that the classification of a image or a text can be performed directly in this space. A disadvantage of CFA is that it has ignored the supervision information. In this paper, we improve CFA by incorporating the supervision information to represent and classify both image and text modals of documents. We project both image and text data to a shared data space by factor analysis, and then train a class label predictor in the shared space to use the class label information. The factor analysis parameter and the predictor parameter are learned jointly by solving one single objective function. With this objective function, we minimize the distance between the projections of image and text of the same document, and the classification error of the projection measured by hinge loss function. The objective function is optimized by an alternate optimization strategy in an iterative algorithm. Experiments in two different multiple modal document data sets show the advantage of the proposed algorithm over other CFA methods."}
{"text": "  Unknown constraints arise in many types of expensive black-box optimization problems. Several methods have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian optimization with constraints, based on the expected improvement (EI) heuristic. However, EI can lead to pathologies when used with constraints. For example, in the case of decoupled constraints---i.e., when one can independently evaluate the objective or the constraints---EI can encounter a pathology that prevents exploration. Additionally, computing EI requires a current best solution, which may not exist if none of the data collected so far satisfy the constraints. By contrast, information-based approaches do not suffer from these failure modes. In this paper, we present a new information-based method called Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). We analyze the performance of PESC and show that it compares favorably to EI-based approaches on synthetic and benchmark problems, as well as several real-world examples. We demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization."}
{"text": "  Annealed importance sampling (AIS) is a common algorithm to estimate partition functions of useful stochastic models. One important problem for obtaining accurate AIS estimates is the selection of an annealing schedule. Conventionally, an annealing schedule is often determined heuristically or is simply set as a linearly increasing sequence. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the optimal schedule by deriving a functional that dominates the AIS estimation error and by numerically minimizing this functional. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed algorithm mostly outperforms conventional scheduling schemes with large quantization numbers."}
{"text": "  Large multilayer neural networks trained with backpropagation have recently achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of problems. However, using backprop for neural net learning still has some disadvantages, e.g., having to tune a large number of hyperparameters to the data, lack of calibrated probabilistic predictions, and a tendency to overfit the training data. In principle, the Bayesian approach to learning neural networks does not have these problems. However, existing Bayesian techniques lack scalability to large dataset and network sizes. In this work we present a novel scalable method for learning Bayesian neural networks, called probabilistic backpropagation (PBP). Similar to classical backpropagation, PBP works by computing a forward propagation of probabilities through the network and then doing a backward computation of gradients. A series of experiments on ten real-world datasets show that PBP is significantly faster than other techniques, while offering competitive predictive abilities. Our experiments also show that PBP provides accurate estimates of the posterior variance on the network weights."}
{"text": "  We describe an iterative procedure for optimizing policies, with guaranteed monotonic improvement. By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified procedure, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is similar to natural policy gradient methods and is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters."}
{"text": "  Bayesian optimization is an effective methodology for the global optimization of functions with expensive evaluations. It relies on querying a distribution over functions defined by a relatively cheap surrogate model. An accurate model for this distribution over functions is critical to the effectiveness of the approach, and is typically fit using Gaussian processes (GPs). However, since GPs scale cubically with the number of observations, it has been challenging to handle objectives whose optimization requires many evaluations, and as such, massively parallelizing the optimization.   In this work, we explore the use of neural networks as an alternative to GPs to model distributions over functions. We show that performing adaptive basis function regression with a neural network as the parametric form performs competitively with state-of-the-art GP-based approaches, but scales linearly with the number of data rather than cubically. This allows us to achieve a previously intractable degree of parallelism, which we apply to large scale hyperparameter optimization, rapidly finding competitive models on benchmark object recognition tasks using convolutional networks, and image caption generation using neural language models."}
{"text": "  We study the classic online learning problem of predicting with expert advice, and propose a truly parameter-free and adaptive algorithm that achieves several objectives simultaneously without using any prior information. The main component of this work is an improved version of the NormalHedge.DT algorithm (Luo and Schapire, 2014), called AdaNormalHedge. On one hand, this new algorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost constant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the algorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts simultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and the competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al. (2009) and Chernov and Vovk (2010). Moreover, we extend the results to the sleeping expert setting and provide two applications to illustrate the power of AdaNormalHedge: 1) competing with time-varying unknown competitors and 2) predicting almost as well as the best pruning tree. Our results on these applications significantly improve previous work from different aspects, and a special case of the first application resolves another open problem proposed by Warmuth and Koolen (2014) on whether one can simultaneously achieve optimal shifting regret for both adversarial and stochastic losses."}

{"text": "  In this work we study the quantitative relation between VC-dimension and two other basic parameters related to learning and teaching. Namely, the quality of sample compression schemes and of teaching sets for classes of low VC-dimension. Let $C$ be a binary concept class of size $m$ and VC-dimension $d$. Prior to this work, the best known upper bounds for both parameters were $\\log(m)$, while the best lower bounds are linear in $d$. We present significantly better upper bounds on both as follows. Set $k = O(d 2^d \\log \\log |C|)$.   We show that there always exists a concept $c$ in $C$ with a teaching set (i.e. a list of $c$-labeled examples uniquely identifying $c$ in $C$) of size $k$. This problem was studied by Kuhlmann (1999). Our construction implies that the recursive teaching (RT) dimension of $C$ is at most $k$ as well. The RT-dimension was suggested by Zilles et al. and Doliwa et al. (2010). The same notion (under the name partial-ID width) was independently studied by Wigderson and Yehudayoff (2013). An upper bound on this parameter that depends only on $d$ is known just for the very simple case $d=1$, and is open even for $d=2$. We also make small progress towards this seemingly modest goal.   We further construct sample compression schemes of size $k$ for $C$, with additional information of $k \\log(k)$ bits. Roughly speaking, given any list of $C$-labelled examples of arbitrary length, we can retain only $k$ labeled examples in a way that allows to recover the labels of all others examples in the list, using additional $k\\log (k)$ information bits. This problem was first suggested by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986)."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of learning to choose actions using contextual information when provided with limited feedback in the form of relative pairwise comparisons. We study this problem in the dueling-bandits framework of Yue et al. (2009), which we extend to incorporate context. Roughly, the learner's goal is to find the best policy, or way of behaving, in some space of policies, although \"best\" is not always so clearly defined. Here, we propose a new and natural solution concept, rooted in game theory, called a von Neumann winner, a randomized policy that beats or ties every other policy. We show that this notion overcomes important limitations of existing solutions, particularly the Condorcet winner which has typically been used in the past, but which requires strong and often unrealistic assumptions. We then present three efficient algorithms for online learning in our setting, and for approximating a von Neumann winner from batch-like data. The first of these algorithms achieves particularly low regret, even when data is adversarial, although its time and space requirements are linear in the size of the policy space. The other two algorithms require time and space only logarithmic in the size of the policy space when provided access to an oracle for solving classification problems on the space."}
{"text": "  A classic tension exists between exact inference in a simple model and approximate inference in a complex model. The latter offers expressivity and thus accuracy, but the former provides coverage of the space, an important property for confidence estimation and learning with indirect supervision. In this work, we introduce a new approach, reified context models, to reconcile this tension. Specifically, we let the amount of context (the arity of the factors in a graphical model) be chosen \"at run-time\" by reifying it---that is, letting this choice itself be a random variable inside the model. Empirically, we show that our approach obtains expressivity and coverage on three natural language tasks."}
{"text": "  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are often used for approximate inference inside learning, but their slow mixing can be difficult to diagnose and the approximations can seriously degrade learning. To alleviate these issues, we define a new model family using strong Doeblin Markov chains, whose mixing times can be precisely controlled by a parameter. We also develop an algorithm to learn such models, which involves maximizing the data likelihood under the induced stationary distribution of these chains. We show empirical improvements on two challenging inference tasks."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under an exact rank constraint on the true underlying matrix $M^*$. Instead of observing a subset of the noisy continuous-valued entries of a matrix $M^*$, we observe a subset of noisy 1-bit (or binary) measurements generated according to a probabilistic model. We consider constrained maximum likelihood estimation of $M^*$, under a constraint on the entry-wise infinity-norm of $M^*$ and an exact rank constraint. This is in contrast to previous work which has used convex relaxations for the rank. We provide an upper bound on the matrix estimation error under this model. Compared to the existing results, our bound has faster convergence rate with matrix dimensions when the fraction of revealed 1-bit observations is fixed, independent of the matrix dimensions. We also propose an iterative algorithm for solving our nonconvex optimization with a certificate of global optimality of the limiting point. This algorithm is based on low rank factorization of $M^*$. We validate the method on synthetic and real data with improved performance over existing methods."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we examine the problem of approximating a general linear dimensionality reduction (LDR) operator, represented as a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ with $m < n$, by a partial circulant matrix with rows related by circular shifts. Partial circulant matrices admit fast implementations via Fourier transform methods and subsampling operations; our investigation here is motivated by a desire to leverage these potential computational improvements in large-scale data processing tasks. We establish a fundamental result, that most large LDR matrices (whose row spaces are uniformly distributed) in fact cannot be well approximated by partial circulant matrices. Then, we propose a natural generalization of the partial circulant approximation framework that entails approximating the range space of a given LDR operator $A$ over a restricted domain of inputs, using a matrix formed as a product of a partial circulant matrix having $m '> m$ rows and a $m \\times k$ 'post processing' matrix. We introduce a novel algorithmic technique, based on sparse matrix factorization, for identifying the factors comprising such approximations, and provide preliminary evidence to demonstrate the potential of this approach."}

{"text": "  We consider the problem of multivariate regression in a setting where the relevant predictors could be shared among different responses. We propose an algorithm which decomposes the coefficient matrix into the product of a long matrix and a wide matrix, with an elastic net penalty on the former and an $\\ell_1$ penalty on the latter. The first matrix linearly transforms the predictors to a set of latent factors, and the second one regresses the responses on these factors. Our algorithm simultaneously performs dimension reduction and coefficient estimation and automatically estimates the number of latent factors from the data. Our formulation results in a non-convex optimization problem, which despite its flexibility to impose effective low-dimensional structure, is difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly in a reasonable time. We specify an optimization algorithm based on alternating minimization with three different sets of updates to solve this non-convex problem and provide theoretical results on its convergence and optimality. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via experiments on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "  We study a general class of online learning problems where the feedback is specified by a graph. This class includes online prediction with expert advice and the multi-armed bandit problem, but also several learning problems where the online player does not necessarily observe his own loss. We analyze how the structure of the feedback graph controls the inherent difficulty of the induced $T$-round learning problem. Specifically, we show that any feedback graph belongs to one of three classes: strongly observable graphs, weakly observable graphs, and unobservable graphs. We prove that the first class induces learning problems with $\\widetilde\\Theta(\\alpha^{1/2} T^{1/2})$ minimax regret, where $\\alpha$ is the independence number of the underlying graph; the second class induces problems with $\\widetilde\\Theta(\\delta^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ minimax regret, where $\\delta$ is the domination number of a certain portion of the graph; and the third class induces problems with linear minimax regret. Our results subsume much of the previous work on learning with feedback graphs and reveal new connections to partial monitoring games. We also show how the regret is affected if the graphs are allowed to vary with time."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the problem of matrix completion when the observed entries are noisy and contain outliers. It begins with introducing a new optimization criterion for which the recovered matrix is defined as its solution. This criterion uses the celebrated Huber function from the robust statistics literature to downweigh the effects of outliers. A practical algorithm is developed to solve the optimization involved. This algorithm is fast, straightforward to implement, and monotonic convergent. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is theoretically shown to be stable in a well defined sense. Its promising empirical performance is demonstrated via a sequence of simulation experiments, including image inpainting."}
{"text": "  Efficiently learning mixture of Gaussians is a fundamental problem in statistics and learning theory. Given samples coming from a random one out of k Gaussian distributions in Rn, the learning problem asks to estimate the means and the covariance matrices of these Gaussians. This learning problem arises in many areas ranging from the natural sciences to the social sciences, and has also found many machine learning applications. Unfortunately, learning mixture of Gaussians is an information theoretically hard problem: in order to learn the parameters up to a reasonable accuracy, the number of samples required is exponential in the number of Gaussian components in the worst case. In this work, we show that provided we are in high enough dimensions, the class of Gaussian mixtures is learnable in its most general form under a smoothed analysis framework, where the parameters are randomly perturbed from an adversarial starting point. In particular, given samples from a mixture of Gaussians with randomly perturbed parameters, when n > {\\Omega}(k^2), we give an algorithm that learns the parameters with polynomial running time and using polynomial number of samples. The central algorithmic ideas consist of new ways to decompose the moment tensor of the Gaussian mixture by exploiting its structural properties. The symmetries of this tensor are derived from the combinatorial structure of higher order moments of Gaussian distributions (sometimes referred to as Isserlis' theorem or Wick's theorem). We also develop new tools for bounding smallest singular values of structured random matrices, which could be useful in other smoothed analysis settings."}
{"text": "  \\emph{Semi-Automated Text Classification} (SATC) may be defined as the task of ranking a set $\\mathcal{D}$ of automatically labelled textual documents in such a way that, if a human annotator validates (i.e., inspects and corrects where appropriate) the documents in a top-ranked portion of $\\mathcal{D}$ with the goal of increasing the overall labelling accuracy of $\\mathcal{D}$, the expected increase is maximized. An obvious SATC strategy is to rank $\\mathcal{D}$ so that the documents that the classifier has labelled with the lowest confidence are top-ranked. In this work we show that this strategy is suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the notion of \\emph{validation gain}, defined as the improvement in classification effectiveness that would derive by validating a given automatically labelled document. We also propose a new effectiveness measure for SATC-oriented ranking methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about by partially validating a list generated by a given ranking method. We report the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method above, and according to the proposed measure, our utility-theoretic ranking methods can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification error."}

{"text": "  This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach for simultaneous sample and feature selection, which is in contrast to existing works which mainly tackle these two problems separately. In fact the two tasks are often interleaved with each other: noisy and high-dimensional features will bring adverse effect on sample selection, while informative or representative samples will be beneficial to feature selection. Specifically, we propose a framework to jointly conduct active learning and feature selection based on the CUR matrix decomposition. From the data reconstruction perspective, both the selected samples and features can best approximate the original dataset respectively, such that the selected samples characterized by the features are highly representative. In particular, our method runs in one-shot without the procedure of iterative sample selection for progressive labeling. Thus, our model is especially suitable when there are few labeled samples or even in the absence of supervision, which is a particular challenge for existing methods. As the joint learning problem is NP-hard, the proposed formulation involves a convex but non-smooth optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an iterative algorithm, and prove its global convergence. Experimental results on publicly available datasets corroborate the efficacy of our method compared with the state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "  We consider classification problems in which the label space has structure. A common example is hierarchical label spaces, corresponding to the case where one label subsumes another (e.g., animal subsumes dog). But labels can also be mutually exclusive (e.g., dog vs cat) or unrelated (e.g., furry, carnivore). To jointly model hierarchy and exclusion relations, the notion of a HEX (hierarchy and exclusion) graph was introduced in [7]. This combined a conditional random field (CRF) with a deep neural network (DNN), resulting in state of the art results when applied to visual object classification problems where the training labels were drawn from different levels of the ImageNet hierarchy (e.g., an image might be labeled with the basic level category \"dog\", rather than the more specific label \"husky\"). In this paper, we extend the HEX model to allow for soft or probabilistic relations between labels, which is useful when there is uncertainty about the relationship between two labels (e.g., an antelope is \"sort of\" furry, but not to the same degree as a grizzly bear). We call our new model pHEX, for probabilistic HEX. We show that the pHEX graph can be converted to an Ising model, which allows us to use existing off-the-shelf inference methods (in contrast to the HEX method, which needed specialized inference algorithms). Experimental results show significant improvements in a number of large-scale visual object classification tasks, outperforming the previous HEX model."}
{"text": "  Many high dimensional sparse learning problems are formulated as nonconvex optimization. A popular approach to solve these nonconvex optimization problems is through convex relaxations such as linear and semidefinite programming. In this paper, we study the statistical limits of convex relaxations. Particularly, we consider two problems: Mean estimation for sparse principal submatrix and edge probability estimation for stochastic block model. We exploit the sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy to sharply characterize the limits of a broad class of convex relaxations. Our result shows statistical optimality needs to be compromised for achieving computational tractability using convex relaxations. Compared with existing results on computational lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection, our theory focuses on a broad class of convex relaxations and does not rely on unproven hypotheses."}
{"text": "  We introduce local expectation gradients which is a general purpose stochastic variational inference algorithm for constructing stochastic gradients through sampling from the variational distribution. This algorithm divides the problem of estimating the stochastic gradients over multiple variational parameters into smaller sub-tasks so that each sub-task exploits intelligently the information coming from the most relevant part of the variational distribution. This is achieved by performing an exact expectation over the single random variable that mostly correlates with the variational parameter of interest resulting in a Rao-Blackwellized estimate that has low variance and can work efficiently for both continuous and discrete random variables. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has interesting similarities with Gibbs sampling but at the same time, unlike Gibbs sampling, it can be trivially parallelized."}
{"text": "  The detection of very similar patterns in a time series, commonly called motifs, has received continuous and increasing attention from diverse scientific communities. In particular, recent approaches for discovering similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared, and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure. Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability of variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series, and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a more broad context."}
{"text": "  Polynomial kernel regression is one of the standard and state-of-the-art learning strategies. However, as is well known, the choices of the degree of polynomial kernel and the regularization parameter are still open in the realm of model selection. The first aim of this paper is to develop a strategy to select these parameters. On one hand, based on the worst-case learning rate analysis, we show that the regularization term in polynomial kernel regression is not necessary. In other words, the regularization parameter can decrease arbitrarily fast when the degree of the polynomial kernel is suitable tuned. On the other hand,taking account of the implementation of the algorithm, the regularization term is required. Summarily, the effect of the regularization term in polynomial kernel regression is only to circumvent the \" ill-condition\" of the kernel matrix. Based on this, the second purpose of this paper is to propose a new model selection strategy, and then design an efficient learning algorithm. Both theoretical and experimental analysis show that the new strategy outperforms the previous one. Theoretically, we prove that the new learning strategy is almost optimal if the regression function is smooth. Experimentally, it is shown that the new strategy can significantly reduce the computational burden without loss of generalization capability."}
{"text": "  Multivariate categorical data occur in many applications of machine learning. One of the main difficulties with these vectors of categorical variables is sparsity. The number of possible observations grows exponentially with vector length, but dataset diversity might be poor in comparison. Recent models have gained significant improvement in supervised tasks with this data. These models embed observations in a continuous space to capture similarities between them. Building on these ideas we propose a Bayesian model for the unsupervised task of distribution estimation of multivariate categorical data. We model vectors of categorical variables as generated from a non-linear transformation of a continuous latent space. Non-linearity captures multi-modality in the distribution. The continuous representation addresses sparsity. Our model ties together many existing models, linking the linear categorical latent Gaussian model, the Gaussian process latent variable model, and Gaussian process classification. We derive inference for our model based on recent developments in sampling based variational inference. We show empirically that the model outperforms its linear and discrete counterparts in imputation tasks of sparse data."}
{"text": "  We resolve an open question from (Christiano, 2014b) posed in COLT'14 regarding the optimal dependency of the regret achievable for online local learning on the size of the label set. In this framework the algorithm is shown a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of $n$ items. The learner then predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size $L$ and receives a real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut among others. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of $O(\\sqrt{nL^3T})$, where $T$ is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of $O(\\sqrt{n \\log L T})$. One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap.   In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming based algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a), in fact achieves a regret of $O(\\sqrt{nLT})$. Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known quasi-polynomial time algorithms.   Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios as well."}
{"text": "  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the information bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be quantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  Standard sparse pseudo-input approximations to the Gaussian process (GP) cannot handle complex functions well. Sparse spectrum alternatives attempt to answer this but are known to over-fit. We suggest the use of variational inference for the sparse spectrum approximation to avoid both issues. We model the covariance function with a finite Fourier series approximation and treat it as a random variable. The random covariance function has a posterior, on which a variational distribution is placed. The variational distribution transforms the random covariance function to fit the data. We study the properties of our approximate inference, compare it to alternative ones, and extend it to the distributed and stochastic domains. Our approximation captures complex functions better than standard approaches and avoids over-fitting."}

We study the risk of this aggregation estimator and show that it is comparable to that of the best estimator based on a single graph, chosen by an oracle. Numerical performance of our method is investigated using both simulated and real datasets, in comparison with some state-of-art estimation procedures."}
{"text": "  We are concerned with obtaining novel concentration inequalities for the missing mass, i.e. the total probability mass of the outcomes not observed in the sample. We not only derive - for the first time - distribution-free Bernstein-like deviation bounds with sublinear exponents in deviation size for missing mass, but also improve the results of McAllester and Ortiz (2003) andBerend and Kontorovich (2013, 2012) for small deviations which is the most interesting case in learning theory. It is known that the majority of standard inequalities cannot be directly used to analyze heterogeneous sums i.e. sums whose terms have large difference in magnitude. Our generic and intuitive approach shows that the heterogeneity issue introduced in McAllester and Ortiz (2003) is resolvable at least in the case of missing mass via regulating the terms using our novel thresholding technique."}

{"text": "  Structured sparsity has recently emerged in statistics, machine learning and signal processing as a promising paradigm for learning in high-dimensional settings. All existing methods for learning under the assumption of structured sparsity rely on prior knowledge on how to weight (or how to penalize) individual subsets of variables during the subset selection process, which is not available in general. Inferring group weights from data is a key open research problem in structured sparsity.In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of group weight learning. We model the group weights as hyperparameters of heavy-tailed priors on groups of variables and derive an approximate inference scheme to infer these hyperparameters. We empirically show that we are able to recover the model hyperparameters when the data are generated from the model, and we demonstrate the utility of learning weights in synthetic and real denoising problems."}
{"text": "  Time-series classification is an important problem for the data mining community due to the wide range of application domains involving time-series data. A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly predictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the prediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates typically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of shapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that avoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean distance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition, our algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out only those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence on 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4 orders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery method, while providing better prediction accuracy."}

{"text": "  This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the \"LINE,\" which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available online."}
{"text": "  In this paper we introduce the idea of improving the performance of parametric temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithms by selectively emphasizing or de-emphasizing their updates on different time steps. In particular, we show that varying the emphasis of linear TD($\\lambda$)'s updates in a particular way causes its expected update to become stable under off-policy training. The only prior model-free TD methods to achieve this with per-step computation linear in the number of function approximation parameters are the gradient-TD family of methods including TDC, GTD($\\lambda$), and GQ($\\lambda$). Compared to these methods, our _emphatic TD($\\lambda$)_ is simpler and easier to use; it has only one learned parameter vector and one step-size parameter. Our treatment includes general state-dependent discounting and bootstrapping functions, and a way of specifying varying degrees of interest in accurately valuing different states."}
{"text": "  Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble supervised machine learning technique that was developed by Breiman over a decade ago. Compared with other ensemble techniques, it has proved its accuracy and superiority. Many researchers, however, believe that there is still room for enhancing and improving its performance accuracy. This explains why, over the past decade, there have been many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven empiricallthat ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, it investigates how data clustering (a well known diversity technique) can be applied to identify groups of similar decision trees in an RF in order to eliminate redundant trees by selecting a representative from each group (cluster). Second, these likely diverse representatives are then used to produce an extension of RF termed CLUB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, and mostly exhibits higher performance in terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called ensemble pruning. Experimental results on 15 real datasets from the UCI repository prove the superiority of our proposed extension over the traditional RF. Most of our experiments achieved at least 95% or above pruning level while retaining or outperforming the RF accuracy."}
{"text": "  Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences and their similarity to a time series can be used for time series classification. Since the discovery of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long or multivariate time series is difficult. In this work we propose Ultra-Fast Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets. It is shown that Ultra-Fast Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-the-art shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by being by up to three orders of magnitudes. Since this method allows a ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time series classification becomes feasible.   A method for using shapelets for multivariate time series is proposed and Ultra-Fast Shapelets is proven to be successful in comparison to state-of-the-art multivariate time series classifiers on 15 multivariate time series datasets from various domains. Finally, time series derivatives that have proven to be useful for other time series classifiers are investigated for the shapelet-based classifiers. It is shown that they have a positive impact and that they are easy to integrate with a simple preprocessing step, without the need of adapting the shapelet discovery algorithm."}

{"text": "  We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. Because the transition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a small move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by back-propagation. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising auto-encoders and provide an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent). We study how GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. Successful experiments are conducted, validating these theoretical results, on two image datasets and with a particular architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining."}
{"text": "  Estimation of response functions is an important task in dynamic medical imaging. This task arises for example in dynamic renal scintigraphy, where impulse response or retention functions are estimated, or in functional magnetic resonance imaging where hemodynamic response functions are required. These functions can not be observed directly and their estimation is complicated because the recorded images are subject to superposition of underlying signals. Therefore, the response functions are estimated via blind source separation and deconvolution. Performance of this algorithm heavily depends on the used models of the response functions. Response functions in real image sequences are rather complicated and finding a suitable parametric form is problematic. In this paper, we study estimation of the response functions using non-parametric Bayesian priors. These priors were designed to favor desirable properties of the functions, such as sparsity or smoothness. These assumptions are used within hierarchical priors of the blind source separation and deconvolution algorithm. Comparison of the resulting algorithms with these priors is performed on synthetic dataset as well as on real datasets from dynamic renal scintigraphy. It is shown that flexible non-parametric priors improve estimation of response functions in both cases. MATLAB implementation of the resulting algorithms is freely available for download."}

{"text": "  In this paper, we investigate a largely extended version of classical MAB problem, called networked combinatorial bandit problems. In particular, we consider the setting of a decision maker over a networked bandits as follows: each time a combinatorial strategy, e.g., a group of arms, is chosen, and the decision maker receives a reward resulting from her strategy and also receives a side bonus resulting from that strategy for each arm's neighbor. This is motivated by many real applications such as on-line social networks where friends can provide their feedback on shared content, therefore if we promote a product to a user, we can also collect feedback from her friends on that product. To this end, we consider two types of side bonus in this study: side observation and side reward. Upon the number of arms pulled at each time slot, we study two cases: single-play and combinatorial-play. Consequently, this leaves us four scenarios to investigate in the presence of side bonus: Single-play with Side Observation, Combinatorial-play with Side Observation, Single-play with Side Reward, and Combinatorial-play with Side Reward. For each case, we present and analyze a series of \\emph{zero regret} polices where the expect of regret over time approaches zero as time goes to infinity. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our results."}
{"text": "  Multi-output Gaussian processes have received increasing attention during the last few years as a natural mechanism to extend the powerful flexibility of Gaussian processes to the setup of multiple output variables. The key point here is the ability to design kernel functions that allow exploiting the correlations between the outputs while fulfilling the positive definiteness requisite for the covariance function. Alternatives to construct these covariance functions are the linear model of coregionalization and process convolutions. Each of these methods demand the specification of the number of latent Gaussian process used to build the covariance function for the outputs. We propose in this paper, the use of an Indian Buffet process as a way to perform model selection over the number of latent Gaussian processes. This type of model is particularly important in the context of latent force models, where the latent forces are associated to physical quantities like protein profiles or latent forces in mechanical systems. We use variational inference to estimate posterior distributions over the variables involved, and show examples of the model performance over artificial data, a motion capture dataset, and a gene expression dataset."}
{"text": "  We analyse optimum reject strategies for prototype-based classifiers and real-valued rejection measures, using the distance of a data point to the closest prototype or probabilistic counterparts. We compare reject schemes with global thresholds, and local thresholds for the Voronoi cells of the classifier. For the latter, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm to compute optimum thresholds based on a dynamic programming scheme, and we propose an intuitive linear time, memory efficient approximation thereof with competitive accuracy. Evaluating the performance in various benchmarks, we conclude that local reject options are beneficial in particular for simple prototype-based classifiers, while the improvement is less pronounced for advanced models. For the latter, an accuracy-reject curve which is comparable to support vector machine classifiers with state of the art reject options can be reached."}

{"text": "  With the rapid increase in volume of time series medical data available through wearable devices, there is a need to employ automated algorithms to label data. Examples of labels include interventions, changes in activity (e.g. sleep) and changes in physiology (e.g. arrhythmias). However, automated algorithms tend to be unreliable resulting in lower quality care. Expert annotations are scarce, expensive, and prone to significant inter- and intra-observer variance. To address these problems, a Bayesian Continuous-valued Label Aggregator(BCLA) is proposed to provide a reliable estimation of label aggregation while accurately infer the precision and bias of each algorithm. The BCLA was applied to QT interval (pro-arrhythmic indicator) estimation from the electrocardiogram using labels from the 2006 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge database. It was compared to the mean, median, and a previously proposed Expectation Maximization (EM) label aggregation approaches. While accurately predicting each labelling algorithm's bias and precision, the root-mean-square error of the BCLA was 11.78$\\pm$0.63ms, significantly outperforming the best Challenge entry (15.37$\\pm$2.13ms) as well as the EM, mean, and median voting strategies (14.76$\\pm$0.52ms, 17.61$\\pm$0.55ms, and 14.43$\\pm$0.57ms respectively with $p<0.0001$)."}
{"text": "  We give a probabilistic interpretation of sampling theory of graph signals. To do this, we first define a generative model for the data using a pairwise Gaussian random field (GRF) which depends on the graph. We show that, under certain conditions, reconstructing a graph signal from a subset of its samples by least squares is equivalent to performing MAP inference on an approximation of this GRF which has a low rank covariance matrix. We then show that a sampling set of given size with the largest associated cut-off frequency, which is optimal from a sampling theoretic point of view, minimizes the worst case predictive covariance of the MAP estimate on the GRF. This interpretation also gives an intuitive explanation for the superior performance of the sampling theoretic approach to active semi-supervised classification."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose the problem of online cost-sensitive clas- sifier adaptation and the first algorithm to solve it. We assume we have a base classifier for a cost-sensitive classification problem, but it is trained with respect to a cost setting different to the desired one. Moreover, we also have some training data samples streaming to the algorithm one by one. The prob- lem is to adapt the given base classifier to the desired cost setting using the steaming training samples online. To solve this problem, we propose to learn a new classifier by adding an adaptation function to the base classifier, and update the adaptation function parameter according to the streaming data samples. Given a input data sample and the cost of misclassifying it, we up- date the adaptation function parameter by minimizing cost weighted hinge loss and respecting previous learned parameter simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is compared to both online and off-line cost-sensitive algorithms on two cost-sensitive classification problems, and the experiments show that it not only outperforms them one classification performances, but also requires significantly less running time."}
{"text": "  Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is a key machine learning algorithm for extracting nonlinear features from data. In the presence of a large volume of high dimensional data collected in a distributed fashion, it becomes very costly to communicate all of this data to a single data center and then perform kernel PCA. Can we perform kernel PCA on the entire dataset in a distributed and communication efficient fashion while maintaining provable and strong guarantees in solution quality?   In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the question by developing a communication efficient algorithm to perform kernel PCA in the distributed setting. The algorithm is a clever combination of subspace embedding and adaptive sampling techniques, and we show that the algorithm can take as input an arbitrary configuration of distributed datasets, and compute a set of global kernel principal components with relative error guarantees independent of the dimension of the feature space or the total number of data points. In particular, computing $k$ principal components with relative error $\\epsilon$ over $s$ workers has communication cost $\\tilde{O}(s \\rho k/\\epsilon+s k^2/\\epsilon^3)$ words, where $\\rho$ is the average number of nonzero entries in each data point. Furthermore, we experimented the algorithm with large-scale real world datasets and showed that the algorithm produces a high quality kernel PCA solution while using significantly less communication than alternative approaches."}
{"text": "  In supervised learning, simple baseline classifiers can be constructed by only looking at the class, i.e., ignoring any other information from the dataset. The single-label learning community frequently uses as a reference the one which always predicts the majority class. Although a classifier might perform worse than this simple baseline classifier, this behaviour requires a special explanation. Aiming to motivate the community to compare experimental results with the ones provided by a multi-label baseline classifier, calling the attention about the need of special explanations related to classifiers which perform worse than the baseline, in this work we propose the use of General_B, a multi-label baseline classifier. General_B was evaluated in contrast to results published in the literature which were carefully selected using a systematic review process. It was found that a considerable number of published results on 10 frequently used datasets are worse than or equal to the ones obtained by General_B, and for one dataset it reaches up to 43% of the dataset published results. Moreover, although a simple baseline classifier was not considered in these publications, it was observed that even for very poor results no special explanations were provided in most of them. We hope that the findings of this work would encourage the multi-label community to consider the idea of using a simple baseline classifier, such that further explanations are provided when a classifiers performs worse than a baseline."}
{"text": "  Sample compression schemes were defined by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986) as an abstraction of the structure underlying many learning algorithms. Roughly speaking, a sample compression scheme of size $k$ means that given an arbitrary list of labeled examples, one can retain only $k$ of them in a way that allows to recover the labels of all other examples in the list. They showed that compression implies PAC learnability for binary-labeled classes, and asked whether the other direction holds. We answer their question and show that every concept class $C$ with VC dimension $d$ has a sample compression scheme of size exponential in $d$. The proof uses an approximate minimax phenomenon for binary matrices of low VC dimension, which may be of interest in the context of game theory."}

Most research in this area has been done as binary classification, where the target class is finding if a person has diabetes or not. But very few, and maybe no work has been done in multi-labeled analysis of the demographics of patients who are likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.

{"text": "  Quasi-Newton methods are widely used in practise for convex loss minimization problems. These methods exhibit good empirical performance on a wide variety of tasks and enjoy super-linear convergence to the optimal solution. For large-scale learning problems, stochastic Quasi-Newton methods have been recently proposed. However, these typically only achieve sub-linear convergence rates and have not been shown to consistently perform well in practice since noisy Hessian approximations can exacerbate the effect of high-variance stochastic gradient estimates. In this work we propose Vite, a novel stochastic Quasi-Newton algorithm that uses an existing first-order technique to reduce this variance. Without exploiting the specific form of the approximate Hessian, we show that Vite reaches the optimum at a geometric rate with a constant step-size when dealing with smooth strongly convex functions. Empirically, we demonstrate improvements over existing stochastic Quasi-Newton and variance reduced stochastic gradient methods."}
{"text": "  Low-rank representation~(LRR) has been a significant method for segmenting data that are generated from a union of subspaces. It is, however, known that solving the LRR program is challenging in terms of time complexity and memory footprint, in that the size of the nuclear norm regularized matrix is $n$-by-$n$ (where $n$ is the number of samples). In this paper, we thereby develop a fast online implementation of LRR that reduces the memory cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(pd)$, with $p$ being the ambient dimension and $d$ being some estimated rank~($d < p \\ll n$). The crux for this end is a non-convex reformulation of the LRR program, which pursues the basis dictionary that generates the (uncorrupted) observations. We build the theoretical guarantee that the sequence of the solutions produced by our algorithm converges to a stationary point of the empirical and the expected loss function asymptotically. Extensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets further substantiate that our algorithm is fast, robust and memory efficient."}
{"text": "  Multi-armed bandits (MAB) model sequential decision making problems, in which a learner sequentially chooses arms with unknown reward distributions in order to maximize its cumulative reward. Most of the prior work on MAB assumes that the reward distributions of each arm are independent. But in a wide variety of decision problems -- from drug dosage to dynamic pricing -- the expected rewards of different arms are correlated, so that selecting one arm provides information about the expected rewards of other arms as well. We propose and analyze a class of models of such decision problems, which we call {\\em global bandits}. In the case in which rewards of all arms are deterministic functions of a single unknown parameter, we construct a greedy policy that achieves {\\em bounded regret}, with a bound that depends on the single true parameter of the problem. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times with probability one. For this case we also obtain a bound on regret that is {\\em independent of the true parameter}; this bound is sub-linear, with an exponent that depends on the informativeness of the arms. We also propose a variant of the greedy policy that achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ worst-case and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ parameter dependent regret. Finally, we perform experiments on dynamic pricing and show that the proposed algorithms achieve significant gains with respect to the well-known benchmarks."}
{"text": "  Symmetric positive semi-definite (SPSD) matrix approximation methods have been extensively used to speed up large-scale eigenvalue computation and kernel learning methods. The standard sketch based method, which we call the prototype model, produces relatively accurate approximations, but is inefficient on large square matrices. The Nystr\\\"om method is highly efficient, but can only achieve low accuracy. In this paper we propose a novel model that we call the {\\it fast SPSD matrix approximation model}. The fast model is nearly as efficient as the Nystr\\\"om method and as accurate as the prototype model. We show that the fast model can potentially solve eigenvalue problems and kernel learning problems in linear time with respect to the matrix size $n$ to achieve $1+\\epsilon$ relative-error, whereas both the prototype model and the Nystr\\\"om method cost at least quadratic time to attain comparable error bound. Empirical comparisons among the prototype model, the Nystr\\\"om method, and our fast model demonstrate the superiority of the fast model. We also contribute new understandings of the Nystr\\\"om method. The Nystr\\\"om method is a special instance of our fast model and is approximation to the prototype model. Our technique can be straightforwardly applied to make the CUR matrix decomposition more efficiently computed without much affecting the accuracy."}
{"text": "  Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) are likelihood-free Monte Carlo methods. ABC methods use a comparison between simulated data, using different parameters drew from a prior distribution, and observed data. This comparison process is based on computing a distance between the summary statistics from the simulated data and the observed data. For complex models, it is usually difficult to define a methodology for choosing or constructing the summary statistics. Recently, a nonparametric ABC has been proposed, that uses a dissimilarity measure between discrete distributions based on empirical kernel embeddings as an alternative for summary statistics. The nonparametric ABC outperforms other methods including ABC, kernel ABC or synthetic likelihood ABC. However, it assumes that the probability distributions are discrete, and it is not robust when dealing with few observations. In this paper, we propose to apply kernel embeddings using an smoother density estimator or Parzen estimator for comparing the empirical data distributions, and computing the ABC posterior. Synthetic data and real data were used to test the Bayesian inference of our method. We compare our method with respect to state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate that our method is a robust estimator of the posterior distribution in terms of the number of observations."}

For these problems, label embeddings have been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and statistical efficiency. In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers a fast label embedding algorithm which works in both the multiclass and multilabel settings. The result is a randomized algorithm for partial least squares, whose running time is exponentially faster than naive algorithms. We demonstrate our techniques on two large-scale public datasets, from the Large Scale Hierarchical Text Challenge and the Open Directory Project, where we obtain state of the art results."}
{"text": "  Categorization axioms have been proposed to axiomatizing clustering results, which offers a hint of bridging the difference between human recognition system and machine learning through an intuitive observation: an object should be assigned to its most similar category. However, categorization axioms cannot be generalized into a general machine learning system as categorization axioms become trivial when the number of categories becomes one. In order to generalize categorization axioms into general cases, categorization input and categorization output are reinterpreted by inner and outer category representation. According to the categorization reinterpretation, two category representation axioms are presented. Category representation axioms and categorization axioms can be combined into a generalized categorization axiomatic framework, which accurately delimit the theoretical categorization constraints and overcome the shortcoming of categorization axioms. The proposed axiomatic framework not only discuses categorization test issue but also reinterprets many results in machine learning in a unified way, such as dimensionality reduction,density estimation, regression, clustering and classification."}
{"text": "  We learn the structure of a Markov Network between two groups of random variables from joint observations. Since modelling and learning the full MN structure may be hard, learning the links between two groups directly may be a preferable option. We introduce a novel concept called the \\emph{partitioned ratio} whose factorization directly associates with the Markovian properties of random variables across two groups. A simple one-shot convex optimization procedure is proposed for learning the \\emph{sparse} factorizations of the partitioned ratio and it is theoretically guaranteed to recover the correct inter-group structure under mild conditions. The performance of the proposed method is experimentally compared with the state of the art MN structure learning methods using ROC curves. Real applications on analyzing bipartisanship in US congress and pairwise DNA/time-series alignments are also reported."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of embedding unweighted, directed k-nearest neighbor graphs in low-dimensional Euclidean space. The k-nearest neighbors of each vertex provides ordinal information on the distances between points, but not the distances themselves. We use this ordinal information along with the low-dimensionality to recover the coordinates of the points up to arbitrary similarity transformations (rigid transformations and scaling). Furthermore, we also illustrate the possibility of robustly recovering the underlying density via the Total Variation Maximum Penalized Likelihood Estimation (TV-MPLE) method. We make existing approaches scalable by using an instance of a local-to-global algorithm based on group synchronization, recently proposed in the literature in the context of sensor network localization and structural biology, which we augment with a scaling synchronization step. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach on large graphs, and show how it compares to the Local Ordinal Embedding (LOE) algorithm, which was recently proposed for recovering the configuration of a cloud of points from pairwise ordinal comparisons between a sparse set of distances."}
{"text": "  The problem of feature selection has raised considerable interests in the past decade. Traditional unsupervised methods select the features which can faithfully preserve the intrinsic structures of data, where the intrinsic structures are estimated using all the input features of data. However, the estimated intrinsic structures are unreliable/inaccurate when the redundant and noisy features are not removed. Therefore, we face a dilemma here: one need the true structures of data to identify the informative features, and one need the informative features to accurately estimate the true structures of data. To address this, we propose a unified learning framework which performs structure learning and feature selection simultaneously. The structures are adaptively learned from the results of feature selection, and the informative features are reselected to preserve the refined structures of data. By leveraging the interactions between these two essential tasks, we are able to capture accurate structures and select more informative features. Experimental results on many benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state of the art unsupervised feature selection methods."}
{"text": "  Understanding the dynamic mechanisms that drive the high-impact scientific work (e.g., research papers, patents) is a long-debated research topic and has many important implications, ranging from personal career development and recruitment search, to the jurisdiction of research resources. Recent advances in characterizing and modeling scientific success have made it possible to forecast the long-term impact of scientific work, where data mining techniques, supervised learning in particular, play an essential role. Despite much progress, several key algorithmic challenges in relation to predicting long-term scientific impact have largely remained open. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive model to forecast the long-term scientific impact at the early stage, which simultaneously addresses a number of these open challenges, including the scholarly feature design, the non-linearity, the domain-heterogeneity and dynamics. In particular, we formulate it as a regularized optimization problem and propose effective and scalable algorithms to solve it. We perform extensive empirical evaluations on large, real scholarly data sets to validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our method."}
{"text": "  We propose a method for estimating channel parameters from RSSI measurements and the lost packet count, which can work in the presence of losses due to both interference and signal attenuation below the noise floor. This is especially important in the wireless networks, such as vehicular, where propagation model changes with the density of nodes. The method is based on Stochastic Expectation Maximization, where the received data is modeled as a mixture of distributions (no/low interference and strong interference), incomplete (censored) due to packet losses. The PDFs in the mixture are Gamma, according to the commonly accepted model for wireless signal and interference power. This approach leverages the loss count as additional information, hence outperforming maximum likelihood estimation, which does not use this information (ML-), for a small number of received RSSI samples. Hence, it allows inexpensive on-line channel estimation from ad-hoc collected data. The method also outperforms ML- on uncensored data mixtures, as ML- assumes that samples are from a single-mode PDF."}
{"text": "  We present a new approach to estimating the interdependence of industries in an economy by applying data science solutions. By exploiting interfirm buyer--seller network data, we show that the problem of estimating the interdependence of industries is similar to the problem of uncovering the latent block structure in network science literature. To estimate the underlying structure with greater accuracy, we propose an extension of the sparse block model that incorporates node textual information and an unbounded number of industries and interactions among them. The latter task is accomplished by extending the well-known Chinese restaurant process to two dimensions. Inference is based on collapsed Gibbs sampling, and the model is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that the proposed model improves in predictive accuracy and successfully provides a satisfactory solution to the motivated problem. We also discuss issues that affect the future performance of this approach."}
{"text": "  Stochastic Dual Coordinate Descent (SDCD) has become one of the most efficient ways to solve the family of $\\ell_2$-regularized empirical risk minimization problems, including linear SVM, logistic regression, and many others. The vanilla implementation of DCD is quite slow; however, by maintaining primal variables while updating dual variables, the time complexity of SDCD can be significantly reduced. Such a strategy forms the core algorithm in the widely-used LIBLINEAR package. In this paper, we parallelize the SDCD algorithms in LIBLINEAR. In recent research, several synchronized parallel SDCD algorithms have been proposed, however, they fail to achieve good speedup in the shared memory multi-core setting. In this paper, we propose a family of asynchronous stochastic dual coordinate descent algorithms (ASDCD). Each thread repeatedly selects a random dual variable and conducts coordinate updates using the primal variables that are stored in the shared memory. We analyze the convergence properties when different locking/atomic mechanisms are applied. For implementation with atomic operations, we show linear convergence under mild conditions. For implementation without any atomic operations or locking, we present the first {\\it backward error analysis} for ASDCD under the multi-core environment, showing that the converged solution is the exact solution for a primal problem with perturbed regularizer. Experimental results show that our methods are much faster than previous parallel coordinate descent solvers."}
{"text": "  The paper outlines a framework for autonomous control of a CRM (customer relationship management) system. First, it explores how a modified version of the widely accepted Recency-Frequency-Monetary Value system of metrics can be used to define the state space of clients or donors. Second, it describes a procedure to determine the optimal direct marketing action in discrete and continuous action space for the given individual, based on his position in the state space. The procedure involves the use of model-free Q-learning to train a deep neural network that relates a client's position in the state space to rewards associated with possible marketing actions. The estimated value function over the client state space can be interpreted as customer lifetime value, and thus allows for a quick plug-in estimation of CLV for a given client. Experimental results are presented, based on KDD Cup 1998 mailing dataset of donation solicitations."}
{"text": "  The recruitment of new personnel is one of the most essential business processes which affect the quality of human capital within any company. It is highly essential for the companies to ensure the recruitment of right talent to maintain a competitive edge over the others in the market. However IT companies often face a problem while recruiting new people for their ongoing projects due to lack of a proper framework that defines a criteria for the selection process. In this paper we aim to develop a framework that would allow any project manager to take the right decision for selecting new talent by correlating performance parameters with the other domain-specific attributes of the candidates. Also, another important motivation behind this project is to check the validity of the selection procedure often followed by various big companies in both public and private sectors which focus only on academic scores, GPA/grades of students from colleges and other academic backgrounds. We test if such a decision will produce optimal results in the industry or is there a need for change that offers a more holistic approach to recruitment of new talent in the software companies. The scope of this work extends beyond the IT domain and a similar procedure can be adopted to develop a recruitment framework in other fields as well. Data-mining techniques provide useful information from the historical projects depending on which the hiring-manager can make decisions for recruiting high-quality workforce. This study aims to bridge this hiatus by developing a data-mining framework based on an ensemble-learning technique to refocus on the criteria for personnel selection. The results from this research clearly demonstrated that there is a need to refocus on the selection-criteria for quality objectives."}
{"text": "  Representation learning is currently a very hot topic in modern machine learning, mostly due to the great success of the deep learning methods. In particular low-dimensional representation which discriminates classes can not only enhance the classification procedure, but also make it faster, while contrary to the high-dimensional embeddings can be efficiently used for visual based exploratory data analysis.   In this paper we propose Maximum Entropy Linear Manifold (MELM), a multidimensional generalization of Multithreshold Entropy Linear Classifier model which is able to find a low-dimensional linear data projection maximizing discriminativeness of projected classes. As a result we obtain a linear embedding which can be used for classification, class aware dimensionality reduction and data visualization. MELM provides highly discriminative 2D projections of the data which can be used as a method for constructing robust classifiers.   We provide both empirical evaluation as well as some interesting theoretical properties of our objective function such us scale and affine transformation invariance, connections with PCA and bounding of the expected balanced accuracy error."}
{"text": "  We consider the inference of the structure of an undirected graphical model in an exact Bayesian framework. More specifically we aim at achieving the inference with close-form posteriors, avoiding any sampling step. This task would be intractable without any restriction on the considered graphs, so we limit our exploration to mixtures of spanning trees. We consider the inference of the structure of an undirected graphical model in a Bayesian framework. To avoid convergence issues and highly demanding Monte Carlo sampling, we focus on exact inference. More specifically we aim at achieving the inference with close-form posteriors, avoiding any sampling step. To this aim, we restrict the set of considered graphs to mixtures of spanning trees. We investigate under which conditions on the priors - on both tree structures and parameters - exact Bayesian inference can be achieved. Under these conditions, we derive a fast an exact algorithm to compute the posterior probability for an edge to belong to {the tree model} using an algebraic result called the Matrix-Tree theorem. We show that the assumption we have made does not prevent our approach to perform well on synthetic and flow cytometry data."}
{"text": "  Brain decoding involves the determination of a subject's cognitive state or an associated stimulus from functional neuroimaging data measuring brain activity. In this setting the cognitive state is typically characterized by an element of a finite set, and the neuroimaging data comprise voluminous amounts of spatiotemporal data measuring some aspect of the neural signal. The associated statistical problem is one of classification from high-dimensional data. We explore the use of functional principal component analysis, mutual information networks, and persistent homology for examining the data through exploratory analysis and for constructing features characterizing the neural signal for brain decoding. We review each approach from this perspective, and we incorporate the features into a classifier based on symmetric multinomial logistic regression with elastic net regularization. The approaches are illustrated in an application where the task is to infer, from brain activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG), the type of video stimulus shown to a subject."}
{"text": "  Co-occurrence Data is a common and important information source in many areas, such as the word co-occurrence in the sentences, friends co-occurrence in social networks and products co-occurrence in commercial transaction data, etc, which contains rich correlation and clustering information about the items. In this paper, we study co-occurrence data using a general energy-based probabilistic model, and we analyze three different categories of energy-based model, namely, the $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_k$ models, which are able to capture different levels of dependency in the co-occurrence data. We also discuss how several typical existing models are related to these three types of energy models, including the Fully Visible Boltzmann Machine (FVBM) ($L_2$), Matrix Factorization ($L_2$), Log-BiLinear (LBL) models ($L_2$), and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model ($L_k$). Then, we propose a Deep Embedding Model (DEM) (an $L_k$ model) from the energy model in a \\emph{principled} manner. Furthermore, motivated by the observation that the partition function in the energy model is intractable and the fact that the major objective of modeling the co-occurrence data is to predict using the conditional probability, we apply the \\emph{maximum pseudo-likelihood} method to learn DEM. In consequence, the developed model and its learning method naturally avoid the above difficulties and can be easily used to compute the conditional probability in prediction. Interestingly, our method is equivalent to learning a special structured deep neural network using back-propagation and a special sampling strategy, which makes it scalable on large-scale datasets. Finally, in the experiments, we show that the DEM can achieve comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on datasets across several application domains."}
{"text": "  In this age of Big Data, machine learning based data mining methods are extensively used to inspect large scale data sets. Deriving applicable predictive modeling from these type of data sets is a challenging obstacle because of their high complexity. Opportunity with high data availability levels, automated classification of data sets has become a critical and complicated function. In this paper, the power of applying MapReduce based Distributed AdaBoosting of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are explored to build reliable predictive bag of classification models. Thus, (i) dataset ensembles are build; (ii) ELM algorithm is used to build weak classification models; and (iii) build a strong classification model from a set of weak classification models. This training model is applied to the publicly available knowledge discovery and data mining datasets."}
{"text": "  Reducing the amount of human supervision is a key problem in machine learning and a natural approach is that of exploiting the relations (structure) among different tasks. This is the idea at the core of multi-task learning. In this context a fundamental question is how to incorporate the tasks structure in the learning problem.We tackle this question by studying a general computational framework that allows to encode a-priori knowledge of the tasks structure in the form of a convex penalty; in this setting a variety of previously proposed methods can be recovered as special cases, including linear and non-linear approaches. Within this framework, we show that tasks and their structure can be efficiently learned considering a convex optimization problem that can be approached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating minimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum."}
{"text": "  Nonlinear component analysis such as kernel Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) and kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) are widely used in machine learning, statistics and data analysis, but they can not scale up to big datasets. Recent attempts have employed random feature approximations to convert the problem to the primal form for linear computational complexity. However, to obtain high quality solutions, the number of random features should be the same order of magnitude as the number of data points, making such approach not directly applicable to the regime with millions of data points.   We propose a simple, computationally efficient, and memory friendly algorithm based on the \"doubly stochastic gradients\" to scale up a range of kernel nonlinear component analysis, such as kernel PCA, CCA and SVD. Despite the \\emph{non-convex} nature of these problems, our method enjoys theoretical guarantees that it converges at the rate $\\tilde{O}(1/t)$ to the global optimum, even for the top $k$ eigen subspace. Unlike many alternatives, our algorithm does not require explicit orthogonalization, which is infeasible on big datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm on large scale synthetic and real world datasets."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a maximum margin classifier that deals with uncertainty in data input. More specifically, we reformulate the SVM framework such that each training example can be modeled by a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution described by its mean vector and its covariance matrix -- the latter modeling the uncertainty. We address the classification problem and define a cost function that is the expected value of the classical SVM cost when data samples are drawn from the multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions that form the set of the training examples. Our formulation approximates the classical SVM formulation when the training examples are isotropic Gaussians with variance tending to zero. We arrive at a convex optimization problem, which we solve efficiently in the primal form using a stochastic gradient descent approach. The resulting classifier, which we name SVM with Gaussian Sample Uncertainty (SVM-GSU), is tested on synthetic data and five publicly available and popular datasets; namely, the MNIST, WDBC, DEAP, TV News Channel Commercial Detection, and TRECVID MED datasets. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  This paper presents the Nataf-Beta Random Field Classifier, a discriminative approach that extends the applicability of the Beta conjugate prior to classification problems. The approach's key feature is to model the probability of a class conditional on attribute values as a random field whose marginals are Beta distributed, and where the parameters of marginals are themselves described by random fields. Although the classification accuracy of the approach proposed does not statistically outperform the best accuracies reported in the literature, it ranks among the top tier for the six benchmark datasets tested. The Nataf-Beta Random Field Classifier is suited as a general purpose classification approach for real-continuous and real-integer attribute value problems."}
{"text": "  The nature of clinical data makes it difficult to quickly select, tune and apply machine learning algorithms to clinical prognosis. As a result, a lot of time is spent searching for the most appropriate machine learning algorithms applicable in clinical prognosis that contains either binary-valued or multi-valued attributes. The study set out to identify and evaluate the performance of machine learning classification schemes applied in clinical prognosis of post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients. Multilayer Perceptron, J48, and the Naive Bayes algorithms were used to train and test models on Thoracic Surgery datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. Stratified 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate baseline performance accuracy of the classifiers. The comparative analysis shows that multilayer perceptron performed best with classification accuracy of 82.3%, J48 came out second with classification accuracy of 81.8%, and Naive Bayes came out the worst with classification accuracy of 74.4%. The quality and outcome of the chosen machine learning algorithms depends on the ingenuity of the clinical miner."}
{"text": "  Acyclic digraphs are the underlying representation of Bayesian networks, a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models. Learning the underlying graph from data is a way of gaining insights about the structural properties of a domain. Structure learning forms one of the inference challenges of statistical graphical models.   MCMC methods, notably structure MCMC, to sample graphs from the posterior distribution given the data are probably the only viable option for Bayesian model averaging. Score modularity and restrictions on the number of parents of each node allow the graphs to be grouped into larger collections, which can be scored as a whole to improve the chain's convergence. Current examples of algorithms taking advantage of grouping are the biased order MCMC, which acts on the alternative space of permuted triangular matrices, and non ergodic edge reversal moves.   Here we propose a novel algorithm, which employs the underlying combinatorial structure of DAGs to define a new grouping. As a result convergence is improved compared to structure MCMC, while still retaining the property of producing an unbiased sample. Finally the method can be combined with edge reversal moves to improve the sampler further."}
{"text": "  We consider the following basic learning task: given independent draws from an unknown distribution over a discrete support, output an approximation of the distribution that is as accurate as possible in $\\ell_1$ distance (i.e. total variation or statistical distance). Perhaps surprisingly, it is often possible to \"de-noise\" the empirical distribution of the samples to return an approximation of the true distribution that is significantly more accurate than the empirical distribution, without relying on any prior assumptions on the distribution. We present an instance optimal learning algorithm which optimally performs this de-noising for every distribution for which such a de-noising is possible. More formally, given $n$ independent draws from a distribution $p$, our algorithm returns a labelled vector whose expected distance from $p$ is equal to the minimum possible expected error that could be obtained by any algorithm that knows the true unlabeled vector of probabilities of distribution $p$ and simply needs to assign labels, up to an additive subconstant term that is independent of $p$ and goes to zero as $n$ gets large. One conceptual implication of this result is that for large samples, Bayesian assumptions on the \"shape\" or bounds on the tail probabilities of a distribution over discrete support are not helpful for the task of learning the distribution.   As a consequence of our techniques, we also show that given a set of $n$ samples from an arbitrary distribution, one can accurately estimate the expected number of distinct elements that will be observed in a sample of any size up to $n \\log n$. This sort of extrapolation is practically relevant, particularly to domains such as genomics where it is important to understand how much more might be discovered given larger sample sizes, and we are optimistic that our approach is practically viable."}
{"text": "  In the presence of weak overall correlation, it may be useful to investigate if the correlation is significantly and substantially more pronounced over a subpopulation. Two different testing procedures are compared. Both are based on the rankings of the values of two variables from a data set with a large number n of observations. The first maintains its level against Gaussian copulas; the second adapts to general alternatives in the sense that that the number of parameters used in the test grows with n. An analysis of wine quality illustrates how the methods detect heterogeneity of association between chemical properties of the wine, which are attributable to a mix of different cultivars."}
{"text": "  Feature selection and feature transformation, the two main ways to reduce dimensionality, are often presented separately. In this paper, a feature selection method is proposed by combining the popular transformation based dimensionality reduction method Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and sparsity regularization. We impose row sparsity on the transformation matrix of LDA through ${\\ell}_{2,1}$-norm regularization to achieve feature selection, and the resultant formulation optimizes for selecting the most discriminative features and removing the redundant ones simultaneously. The formulation is extended to the ${\\ell}_{2,p}$-norm regularized case: which is more likely to offer better sparsity when $0<p<1$. Thus the formulation is a better approximation to the feature selection problem. An efficient algorithm is developed to solve the ${\\ell}_{2,p}$-norm based optimization problem and it is proved that the algorithm converges when $0<p\\le 2$. Systematical experiments are conducted to understand the work of the proposed method. Promising experimental results on various types of real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm."}
{"text": "  We consider two connected aspects of maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter for high-dimensional discrete graphical models: the existence of the maximum likelihood estimate (mle) and its computation.   When the data is sparse, there are many zeros in the contingency table and the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter may not exist. Fienberg and Rinaldo (2012) have shown that the mle does not exists iff the data vector belongs to a face of the so-called marginal cone spanned by the rows of the design matrix of the model. Identifying these faces in high-dimension is challenging. In this paper, we take a local approach : we show that one such face, albeit possibly not the smallest one, can be identified by looking at a collection of marginal graphical models generated by induced subgraphs $G_i,i=1,\\ldots,k$ of $G$. This is our first contribution.   Our second contribution concerns the composite maximum likelihood estimate. When the dimension of the problem is large, estimating the parameters of a given graphical model through maximum likelihood is challenging, if not impossible. The traditional approach to this problem has been local with the use of composite likelihood based on local conditional likelihoods.   A more recent development is to have the components of the composite likelihood be marginal likelihoods centred around each $v$. We first show that the estimates obtained by consensus through local conditional and marginal likelihoods are identical. We then study the asymptotic properties of the composite maximum likelihood estimate when both the dimension of the model and the sample size $N$ go to infinity."}
{"text": "  We introduce a generalization of temporal-difference (TD) learning to networks of interrelated predictions. Rather than relating a single prediction to itself at a later time, as in conventional TD methods, a TD network relates each prediction in a set of predictions to other predictions in the set at a later time. TD networks can represent and apply TD learning to a much wider class of predictions than has previously been possible. Using a random-walk example, we show that these networks can be used to learn to predict by a fixed interval, which is not possible with conventional TD methods. Secondly, we show that if the inter-predictive relationships are made conditional on action, then the usual learning-efficiency advantage of TD methods over Monte Carlo (supervised learning) methods becomes particularly pronounced. Thirdly, we demonstrate that TD networks can learn predictive state representations that enable exact solution of a non-Markov problem. A very broad range of inter-predictive temporal relationships can be expressed in these networks. Overall we argue that TD networks represent a substantial extension of the abilities of TD methods and bring us closer to the goal of representing world knowledge in entirely predictive, grounded terms."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of estimating undirected triangle-free graphs of high dimensional distributions. Triangle-free graphs form a rich graph family which allows arbitrary loopy structures but 3-cliques. For inferential tractability, we propose a graphical Fermat's principle to regularize the distribution family. Such principle enforces the existence of a distribution-dependent pseudo-metric such that any two nodes have a smaller distance than that of two other nodes who have a geodesic path include these two nodes. Guided by this principle, we show that a greedy strategy is able to recover the true graph. The resulting algorithm only requires a pairwise distance matrix as input and is computationally even more efficient than calculating the minimum spanning tree. We consider graph estimation problems under different settings, including discrete and nonparametric distribution families. Thorough numerical results are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  We present a Discriminative Switching Linear Dynamical System (DSLDS) applied to patient monitoring in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Our approach is based on identifying the state-of-health of a patient given their observed vital signs using a discriminative classifier, and then inferring their underlying physiological values conditioned on this status. The work builds on the Factorial Switching Linear Dynamical System (FSLDS) (Quinn et al., 2009) which has been previously used in a similar setting. The FSLDS is a generative model, whereas the DSLDS is a discriminative model. We demonstrate on two real-world datasets that the DSLDS is able to outperform the FSLDS in most cases of interest, and that an $\\alpha$-mixture of the two models achieves higher performance than either of the two models separately."}
{"text": "  Making use of predictions is a crucial, but under-explored, area of online algorithms. This paper studies a class of online optimization problems where we have external noisy predictions available. We propose a stochastic prediction error model that generalizes prior models in the learning and stochastic control communities, incorporates correlation among prediction errors, and captures the fact that predictions improve as time passes. We prove that achieving sublinear regret and constant competitive ratio for online algorithms requires the use of an unbounded prediction window in adversarial settings, but that under more realistic stochastic prediction error models it is possible to use Averaging Fixed Horizon Control (AFHC) to simultaneously achieve sublinear regret and constant competitive ratio in expectation using only a constant-sized prediction window. Furthermore, we show that the performance of AFHC is tightly concentrated around its mean."}
{"text": "  The main contribution of this article is a new prior distribution over directed acyclic graphs, which gives larger weight to sparse graphs. This distribution is intended for structured Bayesian networks, where the structure is given by an ordered block model. That is, the nodes of the graph are objects which fall into categories (or blocks); the blocks have a natural ordering. The presence of a relationship between two objects is denoted by an arrow, from the object of lower category to the object of higher category. The models considered here were introduced in Kemp et al. (2004) for relational data and extended to multivariate data in Mansinghka et al. (2006). The prior over graph structures presented here has an explicit formula. The number of nodes in each layer of the graph follow a Hoppe Ewens urn model.   We consider the situation where the nodes of the graph represent random variables, whose joint probability distribution factorises along the DAG. We describe Monte Carlo schemes for finding the optimal aposteriori structure given a data matrix and compare the performance with Mansinghka et al. (2006) and also with the uniform prior."}
{"text": "  To address the contextual bandit problem, we propose an online random forest algorithm. The analysis of the proposed algorithm is based on the sample complexity needed to find the optimal decision stump. Then, the decision stumps are assembled in a random collection of decision trees, Bandit Forest. We show that the proposed algorithm is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The dependence of the sample complexity upon the number of contextual variables is logarithmic. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm with respect to the time horizon is linear. These analytical results allow the proposed algorithm to be efficient in real applications, where the number of events to process is huge, and where we expect that some contextual variables, chosen from a large set, have potentially non- linear dependencies with the rewards. In the experiments done to illustrate the theoretical analysis, Bandit Forest obtain promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms."}
{"text": "  In this paper, using a novel matrix factorization and simultaneous reduction to diagonal form approach (or in short simultaneous reduction approach), Accelerated Kernel Discriminant Analysis (AKDA) and Accelerated Kernel Subclass Discriminant Analysis (AKSDA) are proposed. Specifically, instead of performing the simultaneous reduction of the between- and within-class or subclass scatter matrices, the nonzero eigenpairs (NZEP) of the so-called core matrix, which is of relatively small dimensionality, and the Cholesky factorization of the kernel matrix are computed, achieving more than one order of magnitude speed up over kernel discriminant analysis (KDA). Moreover, consisting of a few elementary matrix operations and very stable numerical algorithms, AKDA and AKSDA offer improved classification accuracy. The experimental evaluation on various datasets confirms that the proposed approaches provide state-of-the-art performance in terms of both training time and classification accuracy."}
{"text": "  The variational framework for learning inducing variables (Titsias, 2009a) has had a large impact on the Gaussian process literature. The framework may be interpreted as minimizing a rigorously defined Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and posterior processes. To our knowledge this connection has thus far gone unremarked in the literature. In this paper we give a substantial generalization of the literature on this topic. We give a new proof of the result for infinite index sets which allows inducing points that are not data points and likelihoods that depend on all function values. We then discuss augmented index sets and show that, contrary to previous works, marginal consistency of augmentation is not enough to guarantee consistency of variational inference with the original model. We then characterize an extra condition where such a guarantee is obtainable. Finally we show how our framework sheds light on interdomain sparse approximations and sparse approximations for Cox processes."}
{"text": "  We consider optimization of generalized performance metrics for binary classification by means of surrogate losses. We focus on a class of metrics, which are linear-fractional functions of the false positive and false negative rates (examples of which include $F_{\\beta}$-measure, Jaccard similarity coefficient, AM measure, and many others). Our analysis concerns the following two-step procedure. First, a real-valued function $f$ is learned by minimizing a surrogate loss for binary classification on the training sample. It is assumed that the surrogate loss is a strongly proper composite loss function (examples of which include logistic loss, squared-error loss, exponential loss, etc.). Then, given $f$, a threshold $\\widehat{\\theta}$ is tuned on a separate validation sample, by direct optimization of the target performance metric. We show that the regret of the resulting classifier (obtained from thresholding $f$ on $\\widehat{\\theta}$) measured with respect to the target metric is upperbounded by the regret of $f$ measured with respect to the surrogate loss. We also extend our results to cover multilabel classification and provide regret bounds for micro- and macro-averaging measures. Our findings are further analyzed in a computational study on both synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of discriminative factor analysis for data that are in general non-Gaussian. A Bayesian model based on the ranks of the data is proposed. We first introduce a new {\\em max-margin} version of the rank-likelihood. A discriminative factor model is then developed, integrating the max-margin rank-likelihood and (linear) Bayesian support vector machines, which are also built on the max-margin principle. The discriminative factor model is further extended to the {\\em nonlinear} case through mixtures of local linear classifiers, via Dirichlet processes. Fully local conjugacy of the model yields efficient inference with both Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes approaches. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real data demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model and its potential for applications in computational biology."}
{"text": "  We present a machine learning algorithm for building classifiers that are comprised of a small number of disjunctions of conjunctions (or's of and's). An example of a classifier of this form is as follows: If X satisfies (x1 = 'blue' AND x3 = 'middle') OR (x1 = 'blue' AND x2 = '<15') OR (x1 = 'yellow'), then we predict that Y=1, ELSE predict Y=0. An attribute-value pair is called a literal and a conjunction of literals is called a pattern. Models of this form have the advantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they produce a set of conditions that concisely describe a specific class. We present two probabilistic models for forming a pattern set, one with a Beta-Binomial prior, and the other with Poisson priors. In both cases, there are prior parameters that the user can set to encourage the model to have a desired size and shape, to conform with a domain-specific definition of interpretability. We provide two scalable MAP inference approaches: a pattern level search, which involves association rule mining, and a literal level search. We show stronger priors reduce computation. We apply the Bayesian Or's of And's (BOA) model to predict user behavior with respect to in-vehicle context-aware personalized recommender systems."}
{"text": "  We analyze the problem of using Explore-Exploit techniques to improve precision in multi-result ranking systems such as web search, query autocompletion and news recommendation. Adopting an exploration policy directly online, without understanding its impact on the production system, may have unwanted consequences - the system may sustain large losses, create user dissatisfaction, or collect exploration data which does not help improve ranking quality. An offline framework is thus necessary to let us decide what policy and how we should apply in a production environment to ensure positive outcome. Here, we describe such an offline framework.   Using the framework, we study a popular exploration policy - Thompson sampling. We show that there are different ways of implementing it in multi-result ranking systems, each having different semantic interpretation and leading to different results in terms of sustained click-through-rate (CTR) loss and expected model improvement. In particular, we demonstrate that Thompson sampling can act as an online learner optimizing CTR, which in some cases can lead to an interesting outcome: lift in CTR during exploration. The observation is important for production systems as it suggests that one can get both valuable exploration data to improve ranking performance on the long run, and at the same time increase CTR while exploration lasts."}
{"text": "  Music information retrieval faces a challenge in modeling contextualized musical concepts formulated by a set of co-occurring tags. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of our recently proposed approach based on a Siamese neural network in fighting off this challenge. By means of tag features and probabilistic topic models, the network captures contextualized semantics from tags via unsupervised learning. This leads to a distributed semantics space and a potential solution to the out of vocabulary problem which has yet to be sufficiently addressed. We explore the nature of the resultant music-based semantics and address computational needs. We conduct experiments on three public music tag collections -namely, CAL500, MagTag5K and Million Song Dataset- and compare our approach to a number of state-of-the-art semantics learning approaches. Comparative results suggest that this approach outperforms previous approaches in terms of semantic priming and music tag completion."}
{"text": "  We observe that the standard log likelihood training objective for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model of time series data is equivalent to a variational Bayesian training objective, given the proper choice of generative and inference models. This perspective may motivate extensions to both RNNs and variational Bayesian models. We propose one such extension, where multiple particles are used for the hidden state of an RNN, allowing a natural representation of uncertainty or multimodality."}
{"text": "  Thompson sampling is one of the earliest randomized algorithms for multi-armed bandits (MAB). In this paper, we extend the Thompson sampling to Budgeted MAB, where there is random cost for pulling an arm and the total cost is constrained by a budget. We start with the case of Bernoulli bandits, in which the random rewards (costs) of an arm are independently sampled from a Bernoulli distribution. To implement the Thompson sampling algorithm in this case, at each round, we sample two numbers from the posterior distributions of the reward and cost for each arm, obtain their ratio, select the arm with the maximum ratio, and then update the posterior distributions. We prove that the distribution-dependent regret bound of this algorithm is $O(\\ln B)$, where $B$ denotes the budget. By introducing a Bernoulli trial, we further extend this algorithm to the setting that the rewards (costs) are drawn from general distributions, and prove that its regret bound remains almost the same. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Non-linear performance measures are widely used for the evaluation of learning algorithms. For example, $F$-measure is a commonly used performance measure for classification problems in machine learning and information retrieval community. We study the theoretical properties of a subset of non-linear performance measures called pseudo-linear performance measures which includes $F$-measure, \\emph{Jaccard Index}, among many others. We establish that many notions of $F$-measures and \\emph{Jaccard Index} are pseudo-linear functions of the per-class false negatives and false positives for binary, multiclass and multilabel classification. Based on this observation, we present a general reduction of such performance measure optimization problem to cost-sensitive classification problem with unknown costs. We then propose an algorithm with provable guarantees to obtain an approximately optimal classifier for the $F$-measure by solving a series of cost-sensitive classification problems. The strength of our analysis is to be valid on any dataset and any class of classifiers, extending the existing theoretical results on pseudo-linear measures, which are asymptotic in nature. We also establish the multi-objective nature of the $F$-score maximization problem by linking the algorithm with the weighted-sum approach used in multi-objective optimization. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the relative importance of cost asymmetry and thresholding when learning linear classifiers on various $F$-measure optimization tasks."}
{"text": "  Is he/she my type or not? The answer to this question depends on the personal preferences of the one asking it. The individual process of obtaining a full answer may generally be difficult and time consuming, but often an approximate answer can be obtained simply by looking at a photo of the potential match. Such approximate answers based on visual cues can be produced in a fraction of a second, a phenomenon that has led to a series of recently successful dating apps in which users rate others positively or negatively using primarily a single photo. In this paper we explore using convolutional networks to create a model of an individual's personal preferences based on rated photos. This introduced task is difficult due to the large number of variations in profile pictures and the noise in attractiveness labels. Toward this task we collect a dataset comprised of $9364$ pictures and binary labels for each. We compare performance of convolutional models trained in three ways: first directly on the collected dataset, second with features transferred from a network trained to predict gender, and third with features transferred from a network trained on ImageNet. Our findings show that ImageNet features transfer best, producing a model that attains $68.1\\%$ accuracy on the test set and is moderately successful at predicting matches."}
{"text": "  Infinite Hidden Markov Models (iHMM's) are an attractive, nonparametric generalization of the classical Hidden Markov Model which can automatically infer the number of hidden states in the system. However, due to the infinite-dimensional nature of transition dynamics performing inference in the iHMM is difficult. In this paper, we present an infinite-state Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm to resample state trajectories for the iHMM. The proposed algorithm uses an efficient proposal optimized for iHMMs and leverages ancestor sampling to suppress degeneracy of the standard PG algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates significant convergence improvements on synthetic and real world data sets. Additionally, the infinite-state PG algorithm has linear-time complexity in the number of states in the sampler, while competing methods scale quadratically."}
{"text": "  The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is more expressive than all previously considered models because of its external memory. It can be viewed as a broader effort to use abstract external Interfaces and to learn a parametric model that interacts with them.   The capabilities of a model can be extended by providing it with proper Interfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces include memory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as a theorem verifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers of the model. However, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases and search engines, are discrete.   We examine feasibility of learning models to interact with discrete Interfaces. We investigate the following discrete Interfaces: a memory Tape, an input Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train a neural network that interacts with such Interfaces to solve simple algorithmic tasks. Our Interfaces are expressive enough to make our model Turing complete."}
{"text": "  In modern scientific research, massive datasets with huge numbers of observations are frequently encountered. To facilitate the computational process, a divide-and-conquer scheme is often used for the analysis of big data. In such a strategy, a full dataset is first split into several manageable segments; the final output is then averaged from the individual outputs of the segments. Despite its popularity in practice, it remains largely unknown that whether such a distributive strategy provides valid theoretical inferences to the original data. In this paper, we address this fundamental issue for the distributed kernel regression (DKR), where the algorithmic feasibility is measured by the generalization performance of the resulting estimator. To justify DKR, a uniform convergence rate is needed for bounding the generalization error over the individual outputs, which brings new and challenging issues in the big data setup. Under mild conditions, we show that, with a proper number of segments, DKR leads to an estimator that is generalization consistent to the unknown regression function. The obtained results justify the method of DKR and shed light on the feasibility of using other distributed algorithms for processing big data. The promising preference of the method is supported by both simulation and real data examples."}
{"text": "  In order to speed-up classification models when facing a large number of categories, one usual approach consists in organizing the categories in a particular structure, this structure being then used as a way to speed-up the prediction computation. This is for example the case when using error-correcting codes or even hierarchies of categories. But in the majority of approaches, this structure is chosen \\textit{by hand}, or during a preliminary step, and not integrated in the learning process. We propose a new model called Reinforced Decision Tree which simultaneously learns how to organize categories in a tree structure and how to classify any input based on this structure. This approach keeps the advantages of existing techniques (low inference complexity) but allows one to build efficient classifiers in one learning step. The learning algorithm is inspired by reinforcement learning and policy-gradient techniques which allows us to integrate the two steps (building the tree, and learning the classifier) in one single algorithm."}
{"text": "  Collectively, lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma was diagnosed in over 535,340 people out of which, 209,400 deaths were reported [13]. It is estimated that over 600,000 people will be diagnosed with these forms of cancer in 2015. Most of the deaths from lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma result due to late detection. All of these cancers, if detected early, are 100% curable. In this study, we develop and evaluate algorithms to diagnose Breast cancer, Melanoma, and Lung cancer. In the first part of the study, we employed a normalised Gradient Descent and an Artificial Neural Network to diagnose breast cancer with an overall accuracy of 91% and 95% respectively. In the second part of the study, an artificial neural network coupled with image processing and analysis algorithms was employed to achieve an overall accuracy of 93% A naive mobile based application that allowed people to take diagnostic tests on their phones was developed. Finally, a Support Vector Machine algorithm incorporating image processing and image analysis algorithms was developed to diagnose lung cancer with an accuracy of 94%. All of the aforementioned systems had very low false positive and false negative rates. We are developing an online network that incorporates all of these systems and allows people to collaborate globally."}
{"text": "  In many naturally occurring optimization problems one needs to ensure that the definition of the optimization problem lends itself to solutions that are tractable to compute. In cases where exact solutions cannot be computed tractably, it is beneficial to have strong guarantees on the tractable approximate solutions. In order operate under these criterion most optimization problems are cast under the umbrella of convexity or submodularity. In this report we will study design and optimization over a common class of functions called submodular functions. Set functions, and specifically submodular set functions, characterize a wide variety of naturally occurring optimization problems, and the property of submodularity of set functions has deep theoretical consequences with wide ranging applications. Informally, the property of submodularity of set functions concerns the intuitive \"principle of diminishing returns. This property states that adding an element to a smaller set has more value than adding it to a larger set. Common examples of submodular monotone functions are entropies, concave functions of cardinality, and matroid rank functions; non-monotone examples include graph cuts, network flows, and mutual information.   In this paper we will review the formal definition of submodularity; the optimization of submodular functions, both maximization and minimization; and finally discuss some applications in relation to learning and reasoning using submodular functions."}
{"text": "  Hypergraph partitioning lies at the heart of a number of problems in machine learning and network sciences. Many algorithms for hypergraph partitioning have been proposed that extend standard approaches for graph partitioning to the case of hypergraphs. However, theoretical aspects of such methods have seldom received attention in the literature as compared to the extensive studies on the guarantees of graph partitioning. For instance, consistency results of spectral graph partitioning under the stochastic block model are well known. In this paper, we present a planted partition model for sparse random non-uniform hypergraphs that generalizes the stochastic block model. We derive an error bound for a spectral hypergraph partitioning algorithm under this model using matrix concentration inequalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first consistency result related to partitioning non-uniform hypergraphs."}
{"text": "  We address the problem of synthetic gene design using Bayesian optimization. The main issue when designing a gene is that the design space is defined in terms of long strings of characters of different lengths, which renders the optimization intractable. We propose a three-step approach to deal with this issue. First, we use a Gaussian process model to emulate the behavior of the cell. As inputs of the model, we use a set of biologically meaningful gene features, which allows us to define optimal gene designs rules. Based on the model outputs we define a multi-task acquisition function to optimize simultaneously severals aspects of interest. Finally, we define an evaluation function, which allow us to rank sets of candidate gene sequences that are coherent with the optimal design strategy. We illustrate the performance of this approach in a real gene design experiment with mammalian cells."}
{"text": "  Many real world data mining applications involve obtaining predictive models using data sets with strongly imbalanced distributions of the target variable. Frequently, the least common values of this target variable are associated with events that are highly relevant for end users (e.g. fraud detection, unusual returns on stock markets, anticipation of catastrophes, etc.). Moreover, the events may have different costs and benefits, which when associated with the rarity of some of them on the available training data creates serious problems to predictive modelling techniques. This paper presents a survey of existing techniques for handling these important applications of predictive analytics. Although most of the existing work addresses classification tasks (nominal target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems within regression tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey we discuss the main challenges raised by imbalanced distributions, describe the main approaches to these problems, propose a taxonomy of these methods and refer to some related problems within predictive modelling."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel approach for estimating Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) parameters from collapsed Gibbs samples (CGS), by leveraging the full conditional distributions over the latent variable assignments to efficiently average over multiple samples, for little more computational cost than drawing a single additional collapsed Gibbs sample. Our approach can be understood as adapting the soft clustering methodology of Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB0) to CGS parameter estimation, in order to get the best of both techniques. Our estimators can straightforwardly be applied to the output of any existing implementation of CGS, including modern accelerated variants. We perform extensive empirical comparisons of our estimators with those of standard collapsed inference algorithms on real-world data for both unsupervised LDA and Prior-LDA, a supervised variant of LDA for multi-label classification. Our results show a consistent advantage of our approach over traditional CGS under all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 inference in the majority of conditions. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of averaging over multiple samples in LDA parameter estimation, and the use of efficient computational techniques to do so."}
{"text": "  Metric learning aims to embed one metric space into another to benefit tasks like classification and clustering. Although a greatly distorted metric space has a high degree of freedom to fit training data, it is prone to overfitting and numerical inaccuracy. This paper presents {\\it bounded-distortion metric learning} (BDML), a new metric learning framework which amounts to finding an optimal Mahalanobis metric space with a bounded-distortion constraint. An efficient solver based on the multiplicative weights update method is proposed. Moreover, we generalize BDML to pseudo-metric learning and devise the semidefinite relaxation and a randomized algorithm to approximately solve it. We further provide theoretical analysis to show that distortion is a key ingredient for stability and generalization ability of our BDML algorithm. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets yield promising results."}
{"text": "  In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvector of the unnormalized modularity matrix and the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix is developed. Based on this analysis a method to approximate the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix is given, and the relative error of the approximation is derived. A complete proof of the equivalence between normalized modularity clustering and normalized adjacency clustering is also given. Some applications and experiments are given to illustrate and corroborate the points that are made in the theoretical development."}
{"text": "  A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how activity in the nervous system is related to features of the external world, or to features of the nervous system itself. A common approach is to model neural responses as a weighted combination of external features, or vice versa. The structure of the model weights can provide insight into neural representations. Often, neural input-output relationships are sparse, with only a few inputs contributing to the output. In part to account for such sparsity, structured regularizers are incorporated into model fitting optimization. However, by imposing priors, structured regularizers can make it difficult to interpret learned model parameters. Here, we investigate a simple, minimally structured model estimation method for accurate, unbiased estimation of sparse models based on Bootstrapped Adaptive Threshold Selection followed by ordinary least-squares refitting (BoATS). Through extensive numerical investigations, we show that this method often performs favorably compared to L1 and L2 regularizers. In particular, for a variety of model distributions and noise levels, BoATS more accurately recovers the parameters of sparse models, leading to more parsimonious explanations of outputs. Finally, we apply this method to the task of decoding human speech production from ECoG recordings."}
{"text": "  Multi-task feature learning (MTFL) is a powerful technique in boosting the predictive performance by learning multiple related classification/regression/clustering tasks simultaneously. However, solving the MTFL problem remains challenging when the feature dimension is extremely large. In this paper, we propose a novel screening rule---that is based on the dual projection onto convex sets (DPC)---to quickly identify the inactive features---that have zero coefficients in the solution vectors across all tasks. One of the appealing features of DPC is that: it is safe in the sense that the detected inactive features are guaranteed to have zero coefficients in the solution vectors across all tasks. Thus, by removing the inactive features from the training phase, we may have substantial savings in the computational cost and memory usage without sacrificing accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first screening rule that is applicable to sparse models with multiple data matrices. A key challenge in deriving DPC is to solve a nonconvex problem. We show that we can solve for the global optimum efficiently via a properly chosen parametrization of the constraint set. Moreover, DPC has very low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers. We have evaluated the proposed DPC rule on both synthetic and real data sets. The experiments indicate that DPC is very effective in identifying the inactive features---especially for high dimensional data---which leads to a speedup up to several orders of magnitude."}
{"text": "  We study the theoretical properties of learning a dictionary from $N$ signals $\\mathbf x_i\\in \\mathbb R^K$ for $i=1,...,N$ via $l_1$-minimization. We assume that $\\mathbf x_i$'s are $i.i.d.$ random linear combinations of the $K$ columns from a complete (i.e., square and invertible) reference dictionary $\\mathbf D_0 \\in \\mathbb R^{K\\times K}$. Here, the random linear coefficients are generated from either the $s$-sparse Gaussian model or the Bernoulli-Gaussian model. First, for the population case, we establish a sufficient and almost necessary condition for the reference dictionary $\\mathbf D_0$ to be locally identifiable, i.e., a local minimum of the expected $l_1$-norm objective function. Our condition covers both sparse and dense cases of the random linear coefficients and significantly improves the sufficient condition by Gribonval and Schnass (2010). In addition, we show that for a complete $\\mu$-coherent reference dictionary, i.e., a dictionary with absolute pairwise column inner-product at most $\\mu\\in[0,1)$, local identifiability holds even when the random linear coefficient vector has up to $O(\\mu^{-2})$ nonzeros on average. Moreover, our local identifiability results also translate to the finite sample case with high probability provided that the number of signals $N$ scales as $O(K\\log K)$."}
{"text": "  Re-scale boosting (RBoosting) is a variant of boosting which can essentially improve the generalization performance of boosting learning. The key feature of RBoosting lies in introducing a shrinkage degree to re-scale the ensemble estimate in each gradient-descent step. Thus, the shrinkage degree determines the performance of RBoosting.   The aim of this paper is to develop a concrete analysis concerning how to determine the shrinkage degree in $L_2$-RBoosting. We propose two feasible ways to select the shrinkage degree. The first one is to parameterize the shrinkage degree and the other one is to develope a data-driven approach of it. After rigorously analyzing the importance of the shrinkage degree in $L_2$-RBoosting learning, we compare the pros and cons of the proposed methods. We find that although these approaches can reach the same learning rates, the structure of the final estimate of the parameterized approach is better, which sometimes yields a better generalization capability when the number of sample is finite. With this, we recommend to parameterize the shrinkage degree of $L_2$-RBoosting. To this end, we present an adaptive parameter-selection strategy for shrinkage degree and verify its feasibility through both theoretical analysis and numerical verification.   The obtained results enhance the understanding of RBoosting and further give guidance on how to use $L_2$-RBoosting for regression tasks."}
{"text": "  In a range of fields including the geosciences, molecular biology, robotics and computer vision, one encounters problems that involve random variables on manifolds. Currently, there is a lack of flexible probabilistic models on manifolds that are fast and easy to train. We define an extremely flexible class of exponential family distributions on manifolds such as the torus, sphere, and rotation groups, and show that for these distributions the gradient of the log-likelihood can be computed efficiently using a non-commutative generalization of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We discuss applications to Bayesian camera motion estimation (where harmonic exponential families serve as conjugate priors), and modelling of the spatial distribution of earthquakes on the surface of the earth. Our experimental results show that harmonic densities yield a significantly higher likelihood than the best competing method, while being orders of magnitude faster to train."}
{"text": "  Several real-world classification problems are example-dependent cost-sensitive in nature, where the costs due to misclassification vary between examples and not only within classes. However, standard classification methods do not take these costs into account, and assume a constant cost of misclassification errors. In previous works, some methods that take into account the financial costs into the training of different algorithms have been proposed, with the example-dependent cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm being the one that gives the highest savings. In this paper we propose a new framework of ensembles of example-dependent cost-sensitive decision-trees. The framework consists in creating different example-dependent cost-sensitive decision trees on random subsamples of the training set, and then combining them using three different combination approaches. Moreover, we propose two new cost-sensitive combination approaches; cost-sensitive weighted voting and cost-sensitive stacking, the latter being based on the cost-sensitive logistic regression method. Finally, using five different databases, from four real-world applications: credit card fraud detection, churn modeling, credit scoring and direct marketing, we evaluate the proposed method against state-of-the-art example-dependent cost-sensitive techniques, namely, cost-proportionate sampling, Bayes minimum risk and cost-sensitive decision trees. The results show that the proposed algorithms have better results for all databases, in the sense of higher savings."}
{"text": "  We present a unified framework for low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties. We first prove that the proposed estimator attains a faster statistical rate than the traditional low-rank matrix estimator with nuclear norm penalty. Moreover, we rigorously show that under a certain condition on the magnitude of the nonzero singular values, the proposed estimator enjoys oracle property (i.e., exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix), besides attaining a faster rate. As far as we know, this is the first work that establishes the theory of low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties, confirming the advantages of nonconvex penalties for matrix completion. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "  We present Vector-Space Markov Random Fields (VS-MRFs), a novel class of undirected graphical models where each variable can belong to an arbitrary vector space. VS-MRFs generalize a recent line of work on scalar-valued, uni-parameter exponential family and mixed graphical models, thereby greatly broadening the class of exponential families available (e.g., allowing multinomial and Dirichlet distributions). Specifically, VS-MRFs are the joint graphical model distributions where the node-conditional distributions belong to generic exponential families with general vector space domains. We also present a sparsistent $M$-estimator for learning our class of MRFs that recovers the correct set of edges with high probability. We validate our approach via a set of synthetic data experiments as well as a real-world case study of over four million foods from the popular diet tracking app MyFitnessPal. Our results demonstrate that our algorithm performs well empirically and that VS-MRFs are capable of capturing and highlighting interesting structure in complex, real-world data. All code for our algorithm is open source and publicly available."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of learning in the presence of a drifting target concept. Specifically, we provide bounds on the error rate at a given time, given a learner with access to a history of independent samples labeled according to a target concept that can change on each round. One of our main contributions is a refinement of the best previous results for polynomial-time algorithms for the space of linear separators under a uniform distribution. We also provide general results for an algorithm capable of adapting to a variable rate of drift of the target concept. Some of the results also describe an active learning variant of this setting, and provide bounds on the number of queries for the labels of points in the sequence sufficient to obtain the stated bounds on the error rates."}
{"text": "  We study the optimal rates of convergence for estimating a prior distribution over a VC class from a sequence of independent data sets respectively labeled by independent target functions sampled from the prior. We specifically derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal rates under a smoothness condition on the correct prior, with the number of samples per data set equal the VC dimension. These results have implications for the improvements achievable via transfer learning. We additionally extend this setting to real-valued function, where we establish consistency of an estimator for the prior, and discuss an additional application to a preference elicitation problem in algorithmic economics."}
{"text": "  Lifelong reinforcement learning provides a promising framework for developing versatile agents that can accumulate knowledge over a lifetime of experience and rapidly learn new tasks by building upon prior knowledge. However, current lifelong learning methods exhibit non-vanishing regret as the amount of experience increases and include limitations that can lead to suboptimal or unsafe control policies. To address these issues, we develop a lifelong policy gradient learner that operates in an adversarial set- ting to learn multiple tasks online while enforcing safety constraints on the learned policies. We demonstrate, for the first time, sublinear regret for lifelong policy search, and validate our algorithm on several benchmark dynamical systems and an application to quadrotor control."}
{"text": "  Although deep neural networks (DNN) are able to scale with direct advances in computational power (e.g., memory and processing speed), they are not well suited to exploit the recent trends for parallel architectures. In particular, gradient descent is a sequential process and the resulting serial dependencies mean that DNN training cannot be parallelized effectively. Here, we show that a DNN may be replicated over a massive parallel architecture and used to provide a cumulative sampling of local solution space which results in rapid and robust learning. We introduce a complimentary convolutional bootstrapping approach that enhances performance of the parallel architecture further. Our parallelized convolutional bootstrapping DNN out-performs an identical fully-trained traditional DNN after only a single iteration of training."}
{"text": "  Real-world machine learning applications may require functions that are fast-to-evaluate and interpretable. In particular, guaranteed monotonicity of the learned function can be critical to user trust. We propose meeting these goals for low-dimensional machine learning problems by learning flexible, monotonic functions using calibrated interpolated look-up tables. We extend the structural risk minimization framework of lattice regression to train monotonic look-up tables by solving a convex problem with appropriate linear inequality constraints. In addition, we propose jointly learning interpretable calibrations of each feature to normalize continuous features and handle categorical or missing data, at the cost of making the objective non-convex. We address large-scale learning through parallelization, mini-batching, and propose random sampling of additive regularizer terms. Case studies with real-world problems with five to sixteen features and thousands to millions of training samples demonstrate the proposed monotonic functions can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on practical problems while providing greater transparency to users."}
{"text": "  This paper addresses an important issue, known as sensor drift that behaves a nonlinear dynamic property in electronic nose (E-nose), from the viewpoint of machine learning. Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been studied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift compensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the unified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for the purpose of this paper, respectively. In order to percept the differences among ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided. Experiments on the popular sensor drift data with multiple batches collected by E-nose system clearly demonstrate that the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing drift compensation methods without cumbersome measures, and also bring new perspectives for ELM."}
{"text": "  This paper presents an algorithm for efficient training of sparse linear models with elastic net regularization. Extending previous work on delayed updates, the new algorithm applies stochastic gradient updates to non-zero features only, bringing weights current as needed with closed-form updates. Closed-form delayed updates for the $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_{\\infty}$, and rarely used $\\ell_2$ regularizers have been described previously. This paper provides closed-form updates for the popular squared norm $\\ell^2_2$ and elastic net regularizers.   We provide dynamic programming algorithms that perform each delayed update in constant time. The new $\\ell^2_2$ and elastic net methods handle both fixed and varying learning rates, and both standard {stochastic gradient descent} (SGD) and {forward backward splitting (FoBoS)}. Experimental results show that on a bag-of-words dataset with $260,941$ features, but only $88$ nonzero features on average per training example, the dynamic programming method trains a logistic regression classifier with elastic net regularization over $2000$ times faster than otherwise."}
{"text": "  Online learning has been in the spotlight from the machine learning society for a long time. To handle massive data in Big Data era, one single learner could never efficiently finish this heavy task. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel distributed online learning algorithm to solve the problem. Comparing to typical centralized online learner, the distributed learners optimize their own learning parameters based on local data sources and timely communicate with neighbors. However, communication may lead to a privacy breach. Thus, we use differential privacy to preserve the privacy of learners, and study the influence of guaranteeing differential privacy on the utility of the distributed online learning algorithm. Furthermore, by using the results from Kakade and Tewari (2009), we use the regret bounds of online learning to achieve fast convergence rates for offline learning algorithms in distributed scenarios, which provides tighter utility performance than the existing state-of-the-art results. In simulation, we demonstrate that the differentially private offline learning algorithm has high variance, but we can use mini-batch to improve the performance. Finally, the simulations show that the analytical results of our proposed theorems are right and our private distributed online learning algorithm is a general framework."}
{"text": "  We consider statistical and algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. Prior results show that, from an \\emph{algorithmic perspective}, when using sketching matrices constructed from random projections and leverage-score sampling, if the number of samples $r$ much smaller than the original sample size $n$, then the worst-case (WC) error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a very small relative error. From a \\emph{statistical perspective}, one typically considers the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data are generated according to a statistical linear model. In this paper, we provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing, in a unified manner, algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $r$ is much smaller than $n$, while the PE typically requires the number of samples $r$ to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent work show that our upper bounds on PE can not be improved."}
{"text": "  We empirically evaluate a stochastic annealing strategy for Bayesian posterior optimization with variational inference. Variational inference is a deterministic approach to approximate posterior inference in Bayesian models in which a typically non-convex objective function is locally optimized over the parameters of the approximating distribution. We investigate an annealing method for optimizing this objective with the aim of finding a better local optimal solution and compare with deterministic annealing methods and no annealing. We show that stochastic annealing can provide clear improvement on the GMM and HMM, while performance on LDA tends to favor deterministic annealing methods."}
{"text": "  The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given the limited data that was used."}
{"text": "  Convex potential minimisation is the de facto approach to binary classification. However, Long and Servedio [2010] proved that under symmetric label noise (SLN), minimisation of any convex potential over a linear function class can result in classification performance equivalent to random guessing. This ostensibly shows that convex losses are not SLN-robust. In this paper, we propose a convex, classification-calibrated loss and prove that it is SLN-robust. The loss avoids the Long and Servedio [2010] result by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss, where one does not clamp at zero; hence, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that the optimal unhinged solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM, and is the limiting solution for any convex potential; this implies that strong l2 regularisation makes most standard learners SLN-robust. Experiments confirm the SLN-robustness of the unhinged loss."}
{"text": "  A recurring problem when building probabilistic latent variable models is regularization and model selection, for instance, the choice of the dimensionality of the latent space. In the context of belief networks with latent variables, this problem has been adressed with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) employing Monte Carlo inference. We present a variational inference approach to ARD for Deep Generative Models using doubly stochastic variational inference to provide fast and scalable learning. We show empirical results on a standard dataset illustrating the effects of contracting the latent space automatically. We show that the resulting latent representations are significantly more compact without loss of expressive power of the learned models."}
{"text": "  The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for efficient exploration of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These facilities could be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. E.g. in biological experiments many experimental set ups allow several samples to be simultaneously processed. Batch methods, however, require modeling of the interaction between the evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate a simple heuristic based on an estimate of the Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction (i.e. local repulsion) at negligible computational overhead. The resulting algorithm compares well, in running time, with much more elaborate alternatives. The approach assumes that the function of interest, $f$, is a Lipschitz continuous function. A wrap-loop around the acquisition function is used to collect batches of points of certain size minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The speed-up of our method with respect to previous approaches is significant in a set of computationally expensive experiments."}
{"text": "  Models of complex systems are often formalized as sequential software simulators: computationally intensive programs that iteratively build up probable system configurations given parameters and initial conditions. These simulators enable modelers to capture effects that are difficult to characterize analytically or summarize statistically. However, in many real-world applications, these simulations need to be inverted to match the observed data. This typically requires the custom design, derivation and implementation of sophisticated inversion algorithms. Here we give a framework for inverting a broad class of complex software simulators via probabilistic programming and automatic inference, using under 20 lines of probabilistic code. Our approach is based on a formulation of inversion as approximate inference in a simple sequential probabilistic model. We implement four inference strategies, including Metropolis-Hastings, a sequentialized Metropolis-Hastings scheme, and a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, requiring 4 or fewer lines of probabilistic code each. We demonstrate our framework by applying it to invert a real geological software simulator from the oil and gas industry."}

Two algorithms are proposed that instead seek to minimize regret with respect to the Copeland winner, which, unlike the Condorcet winner, is guaranteed to exist. The first, Copeland Confidence Bound (CCB), is designed for small numbers of arms, while the second, Scalable Copeland Bandits (SCB), works better for large-scale problems. We provide theoretical results bounding the regret accumulated by CCB and SCB, both substantially improving existing results. Such existing results either offer bounds of the form $O(K \\log T)$ but require restrictive assumptions, or offer bounds of the form $O(K^2 \\log T)$ without requiring such assumptions. Our results offer the best of both worlds: $O(K \\log T)$ bounds without restrictive assumptions."}
{"text": "  This paper examines the use of a residual bootstrap for bias correction in machine learning regression methods. Accounting for bias is an important obstacle in recent efforts to develop statistical inference for machine learning methods. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed bootstrap bias correction can lead to substantial improvements in both bias and predictive accuracy. In the context of ensembles of trees, we show that this correction can be approximated at only double the cost of training the original ensemble without introducing additional variance. Our method is shown to improve test-set accuracy over random forests by up to 70\\% on example problems from the UCI repository."}
{"text": "  The outputs of a trained neural network contain much richer information than just an one-hot classifier. For example, a neural network might give an image of a dog the probability of one in a million of being a cat but it is still much larger than the probability of being a car. To reveal the hidden structure in them, we apply two unsupervised learning algorithms, PCA and ICA, to the outputs of a deep Convolutional Neural Network trained on the ImageNet of 1000 classes. The PCA/ICA embedding of the object classes reveals their visual similarity and the PCA/ICA components can be interpreted as common visual features shared by similar object classes. For an application, we proposed a new zero-shot learning method, in which the visual features learned by PCA/ICA are employed. Our zero-shot learning method achieves the state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet of over 20000 classes."}
{"text": "  As we aim at alleviating the curse of high-dimensionality, subspace learning is becoming more popular. Existing approaches use either information about global or local structure of the data, and few studies simultaneously focus on global and local structures as the both of them contain important information. In this paper, we propose a global and local structure preserving sparse subspace learning (GLoSS) model for unsupervised feature selection. The model can simultaneously realize feature selection and subspace learning. In addition, we develop a greedy algorithm to establish a generic combinatorial model, and an iterative strategy based on an accelerated block coordinate descent is used to solve the GLoSS problem. We also provide whole iterate sequence convergence analysis of the proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to show the superiority of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection approaches."}
{"text": "  Biclustering involves the simultaneous clustering of objects and their attributes, thus defining local two-way clustering models. Recently, efficient algorithms were conceived to enumerate all biclusters in real-valued datasets. In this case, the solution composes a complete set of maximal and non-redundant biclusters. However, the ability to enumerate biclusters revealed a challenging scenario: in noisy datasets, each true bicluster may become highly fragmented and with a high degree of overlapping. It prevents a direct analysis of the obtained results. To revert the fragmentation, we propose here two approaches for properly aggregating the whole set of enumerated biclusters: one based on single linkage and the other directly exploring the rate of overlapping. Both proposals were compared with each other and with the actual state-of-the-art in several experiments, and they not only significantly reduced the number of biclusters but also consistently increased the quality of the solution."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose the Structured Deep Neural Network (Structured DNN) as a structured and deep learning algorithm, learning to find the best structured object (such as a label sequence) given a structured input (such as a vector sequence) by globally considering the mapping relationships between the structure rather than item by item.   When automatic speech recognition is viewed as a special case of such a structured learning problem, where we have the acoustic vector sequence as the input and the phoneme label sequence as the output, it becomes possible to comprehensively learned utterance by utterance as a whole, rather than frame by frame.   Structured Support Vector Machine (structured SVM) was proposed to perform ASR with structured learning previously, but limited by the linear nature of SVM. Here we propose structured DNN to use nonlinear transformations in multi-layers as a structured and deep learning algorithm. It was shown to beat structured SVM in preliminary experiments on TIMIT."}
{"text": "  Unsupervised feature selection has been always attracting research attention in the communities of machine learning and data mining for decades. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature selection method seeking a feature coefficient matrix to select the most distinctive features. Specifically, our proposed algorithm integrates the Maximum Margin Criterion with a sparsity-based model into a joint framework, where the class margin and feature correlation are taken into account at the same time. To maximize the total data separability while preserving minimized within-class scatter simultaneously, we propose to embed Kmeans into the framework generating pseudo class label information in a scenario of unsupervised feature selection. Meanwhile, a sparsity-based model, ` 2 ,p-norm, is imposed to the regularization term to effectively discover the sparse structures of the feature coefficient matrix. In this way, noisy and irrelevant features are removed by ruling out those features whose corresponding coefficients are zeros. To alleviate the local optimum problem that is caused by random initializations of K-means, a convergence guaranteed algorithm with an updating strategy for the clustering indicator matrix, is proposed to iteractively chase the optimal solution. Performance evaluation is extensively conducted over six benchmark data sets. From plenty of experimental results, it is demonstrated that our method has superior performance against all other compared approaches."}
{"text": "  In machine learning contests such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge and the KDD Cup, contestants can submit candidate solutions and receive from an oracle (typically the organizers of the competition) the accuracy of their guesses compared to the ground-truth labels. One of the most commonly used accuracy metrics for binary classification tasks is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). In this paper we provide proofs-of-concept of how knowledge of the AUC of a set of guesses can be used, in two different kinds of attacks, to improve the accuracy of those guesses. On the other hand, we also demonstrate the intractability of one kind of AUC exploit by proving that the number of possible binary labelings of $n$ examples for which a candidate solution obtains a AUC score of $c$ grows exponentially in $n$, for every $c\\in (0,1)$."}
{"text": "  For large matrix factorisation problems, we develop a distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) that we call Parallel SGLD (PSGLD). PSGLD has very favourable scaling properties with increasing data size and is comparable in terms of computational requirements to optimisation methods based on stochastic gradient descent. PSGLD achieves high performance by exploiting the conditional independence structure of the MF models to sub-sample data in a systematic manner as to allow parallelisation and distributed computation. We provide a convergence proof of the algorithm and verify its superior performance on various architectures such as Graphics Processing Units, shared memory multi-core systems and multi-computer clusters."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we address the problem of multi-label classification. We consider linear classifiers and propose to learn a prior over the space of labels to directly leverage the performance of such methods. This prior takes the form of a quadratic function of the labels and permits to encode both attractive and repulsive relations between labels. We cast this problem as a structured prediction one aiming at optimizing either the accuracies of the predictors or the F 1-score. This leads to an optimization problem closely related to the max-cut problem, which naturally leads to semidefinite and spectral relaxations. We show on standard datasets how such a general prior can improve the performances of multi-label techniques."}
{"text": "  Deep networks trained on large-scale data can learn transferable features to promote learning multiple tasks. Since deep features eventually transition from general to specific along deep networks, a fundamental problem of multi-task learning is how to exploit the task relatedness underlying parameter tensors and improve feature transferability in the multiple task-specific layers. This paper presents Multilinear Relationship Networks (MRN) that discover the task relationships based on novel tensor normal priors over parameter tensors of multiple task-specific layers in deep convolutional networks. By jointly learning transferable features and multilinear relationships of tasks and features, MRN is able to alleviate the dilemma of negative-transfer in the feature layers and under-transfer in the classifier layer. Experiments show that MRN yields state-of-the-art results on three multi-task learning datasets."}
{"text": "  We show that a neural network with arbitrary depth and non-linearities, with dropout applied before every weight layer, is mathematically equivalent to an approximation to a well known Bayesian model. This interpretation might offer an explanation to some of dropout's key properties, such as its robustness to over-fitting. Our interpretation allows us to reason about uncertainty in deep learning, and allows the introduction of the Bayesian machinery into existing deep learning frameworks in a principled way.   This document is an appendix for the main paper \"Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning\" by Gal and Ghahramani, 2015."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we explore the inclusion of latent random variables into the dynamic hidden state of a recurrent neural network (RNN) by combining elements of the variational autoencoder. We argue that through the use of high-level latent random variables, the variational RNN (VRNN)1 can model the kind of variability observed in highly structured sequential data such as natural speech. We empirically evaluate the proposed model against related sequential models on four speech datasets and one handwriting dataset. Our results show the important roles that latent random variables can play in the RNN dynamic hidden state."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose a family of tractable kernels that is dense in the family of bounded positive semi-definite functions (i.e. can approximate any bounded kernel with arbitrary precision). We start by discussing the case of stationary kernels, and propose a family of spectral kernels that extends existing approaches such as spectral mixture kernels and sparse spectrum kernels. Our extension has two primary advantages. Firstly, unlike existing spectral approaches that yield infinite differentiability, the kernels we introduce allow learning the degree of differentiability of the latent function in Gaussian process (GP) models and functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in other kernel methods. Secondly, we show that some of the kernels we propose require fewer parameters than existing spectral kernels for the same accuracy, thereby leading to faster and more robust inference. Finally, we generalize our approach and propose a flexible and tractable family of spectral kernels that we prove can approximate any continuous bounded nonstationary kernel."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new class of nonstationary kernels, which we derive as covariance functions of a novel family of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs). We construct string GPs to allow for multiple types of local patterns in the data, while ensuring a mild global regularity condition. In this paper, we illustrate the efficacy of the approach using synthetic data and demonstrate that the model outperforms competing approaches on well studied, real-life datasets that exhibit nonstationary features."}
{"text": "  It is becoming increasingly important for machine learning methods to make predictions that are interpretable as well as accurate. In many practical applications, it is of interest which features and feature interactions are relevant to the prediction task. We present a novel method, Selective Bayesian Forest Classifier, that strikes a balance between predictive power and interpretability by simultaneously performing classification, feature selection, feature interaction detection and visualization. It builds parsimonious yet flexible models using tree-structured Bayesian networks, and samples an ensemble of such models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We build in feature selection by dividing the trees into two groups according to their relevance to the outcome of interest. Our method performs competitively on classification and feature selection benchmarks in low and high dimensions, and includes a visualization tool that provides insight into relevant features and interactions."}
{"text": "  The subdifferential of convex functions of the singular spectrum of real matrices has been widely studied in matrix analysis, optimization and automatic control theory. Convex analysis and optimization over spaces of tensors is now gaining much interest due to its potential applications to signal processing, statistics and engineering. The goal of this paper is to present an applications to the problem of low rank tensor recovery based on linear random measurement by extending the results of Tropp to the tensors setting."}
{"text": "  We first present a general risk bound for ensembles that depends on the Lp norm of the weighted combination of voters which can be selected from a continuous set. We then propose a boosting method, called QuadBoost, which is strongly supported by the general risk bound and has very simple rules for assigning the voters' weights. Moreover, QuadBoost exhibits a rate of decrease of its empirical error which is slightly faster than the one achieved by AdaBoost. The experimental results confirm the expectation of the theory that QuadBoost is a very efficient method for learning ensembles."}
{"text": "  We propose Kernel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (KMC), a gradient-free adaptive MCMC algorithm based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). On target densities where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC adaptively learns the target's gradient structure by fitting an exponential family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free samplers. We support our claims with experimental studies on both toy and real-world applications, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and exact-approximate MCMC."}
{"text": "  We consider emphatic temporal-difference learning algorithms for policy evaluation in discounted Markov decision processes with finite spaces. Such algorithms were recently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White (2015) as an improved solution to the problem of divergence of off-policy temporal-difference learning with linear function approximation. We present in this paper the first convergence proofs for two emphatic algorithms, ETD($\\lambda$) and ELSTD($\\lambda$). We prove, under general off-policy conditions, the convergence in $L^1$ for ELSTD($\\lambda$) iterates, and the almost sure convergence of the approximate value functions calculated by both algorithms using a single infinitely long trajectory. Our analysis involves new techniques with applications beyond emphatic algorithms leading, for example, to the first proof that standard TD($\\lambda$) also converges under off-policy training for $\\lambda$ sufficiently large."}
{"text": "  In this paper, a novel framework of sparse kernel learning for Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) based anomaly detection is presented. In this work, optimal sparse feature selection for anomaly detection is first modeled as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Due to the prohibitively high computational complexity of the MIP, it is relaxed into a Quadratically Constrained Linear Programming (QCLP) problem. The QCLP problem can then be practically solved by using an iterative optimization method, in which multiple subsets of features are iteratively found as opposed to a single subset. The QCLP-based iterative optimization problem is solved in a finite space called the \\emph{Empirical Kernel Feature Space} (EKFS) instead of in the input space or \\emph{Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space} (RKHS). This is possible because of the fact that the geometrical properties of the EKFS and the corresponding RKHS remain the same. Now, an explicit nonlinear exploitation of the data in a finite EKFS is achievable, which results in optimal feature ranking. Experimental results based on a hyperspectral image show that the proposed method can provide improved performance over the current state-of-the-art techniques."}
{"text": "  There is renewed interest in formulating integration as an inference problem, motivated by obtaining a full distribution over numerical error that can be propagated through subsequent computation. Current methods, such as Bayesian Quadrature, demonstrate impressive empirical performance but lack theoretical analysis. An important challenge is to reconcile these probabilistic integrators with rigorous convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present the first probabilistic integrator that admits such theoretical treatment, called Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature (FWBQ). Under FWBQ, convergence to the true value of the integral is shown to be exponential and posterior contraction rates are proven to be superexponential. In simulations, FWBQ is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and out-performs alternatives based on Frank-Wolfe optimisation. Our approach is applied to successfully quantify numerical error in the solution to a challenging model choice problem in cellular biology."}
{"text": "  In recent years there has been an increased interest in statistical analysis of data with multiple types of relations among a set of entities. Such multi-relational data can be represented as multi-layer graphs where the set of vertices represents the entities and multiple types of edges represent the different relations among them. For community detection in multi-layer graphs, we consider two random graph models, the multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (MLSBM) and a model with a restricted parameter space, the restricted multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (RMLSBM). We derive consistency results for community assignments of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) in both models where MLSBM is assumed to be the true model, and either the number of nodes or the number of types of edges or both grow. We compare MLEs in the two models with other baseline approaches, such as separate modeling of layers, aggregating the layers and majority voting. RMLSBM is shown to have advantage over MLSBM when either the growth rate of the number of communities is high or the growth rate of the average degree of the component graphs in the multi-graph is low. We also derive minimax rates of error and sharp thresholds for achieving consistency of community detection in both models, which are then used to compare the multi-layer models with a baseline model, the aggregate stochastic block model. The simulation studies and real data applications confirm the superior performance of the multi-layer approaches in comparison to the baseline procedures."}
{"text": "  We study the interpretability of conditional probability estimates for binary classification under the agnostic setting or scenario. Under the agnostic setting, conditional probability estimates do not necessarily reflect the true conditional probabilities. Instead, they have a certain calibration property: among all data points that the classifier has predicted P(Y = 1|X) = p, p portion of them actually have label Y = 1. For cost-sensitive decision problems, this calibration property provides adequate support for us to use Bayes Decision Theory. In this paper, we define a novel measure for the calibration property together with its empirical counterpart, and prove an uniform convergence result between them. This new measure enables us to formally justify the calibration property of conditional probability estimations, and provides new insights on the problem of estimating and calibrating conditional probabilities."}
{"text": "  The modern scale of data has brought new challenges to Bayesian inference. In particular, conventional MCMC algorithms are computationally very expensive for large data sets. A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies random partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is distribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales. We provide theoretical justification and extensive experiments illustrating empirical performance."}
{"text": "  Corrupting the input and hidden layers of deep neural networks (DNNs) with multiplicative noise, often drawn from the Bernoulli distribution (or 'dropout'), provides regularization that has significantly contributed to deep learning's success. However, understanding how multiplicative corruptions prevent overfitting has been difficult due to the complexity of a DNN's functional form. In this paper, we show that when a Gaussian prior is placed on a DNN's weights, applying multiplicative noise induces a Gaussian scale mixture, which can be reparameterized to circumvent the problematic likelihood function. Analysis can then proceed by using a type-II maximum likelihood procedure to derive a closed-form expression revealing how regularization evolves as a function of the network's weights. Results show that multiplicative noise forces weights to become either sparse or invariant to rescaling. We find our analysis has implications for model compression as it naturally reveals a weight pruning rule that starkly contrasts with the commonly used signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While the SNR prunes weights with large variances, seeing them as noisy, our approach recognizes their robustness and retains them. We empirically demonstrate our approach has a strong advantage over the SNR heuristic and is competitive to retraining with soft targets produced from a teacher model."}
{"text": "  Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference. Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). The user only provides a Bayesian model and a dataset; nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan."}
{"text": "  The outputs of non-linear feed-forward neural network are positive, which could be treated as probability when they are normalized to one. If we take Entropy-Based Principle into consideration, the outputs for each sample could be represented as the distribution of this sample for different clusters. Entropy-Based Principle is the principle with which we could estimate the unknown distribution under some limited conditions. As this paper defines two processes in Feed-Forward Neural Network, our limited condition is the abstracted features of samples which are worked out in the abstraction process. And the final outputs are the probability distribution for different clusters in the clustering process. As Entropy-Based Principle is considered into the feed-forward neural network, a clustering method is born. We have conducted some experiments on six open UCI datasets, comparing with a few baselines and applied purity as the measurement . The results illustrate that our method outperforms all the other baselines that are most popular clustering methods."}
{"text": "  Margin-Based Principle has been proposed for a long time, it has been proved that this principle could reduce the structural risk and improve the performance in both theoretical and practical aspects. Meanwhile, feed-forward neural network is a traditional classifier, which is very hot at present with a deeper architecture. However, the training algorithm of feed-forward neural network is developed and generated from Widrow-Hoff Principle that means to minimize the squared error. In this paper, we propose a new training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks based on Margin-Based Principle, which could effectively promote the accuracy and generalization ability of neural network classifiers with less labelled samples and flexible network. We have conducted experiments on four UCI open datasets and achieved good results as expected. In conclusion, our model could handle more sparse labelled and more high-dimension dataset in a high accuracy while modification from old ANN method to our method is easy and almost free of work."}
{"text": "  Learning of low dimensional structure in multidimensional data is a canonical problem in machine learning. One common approach is to suppose that the observed data are close to a lower-dimensional smooth manifold. There are a rich variety of manifold learning methods available, which allow mapping of data points to the manifold. However, there is a clear lack of probabilistic methods that allow learning of the manifold along with the generative distribution of the observed data. The best attempt is the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), but identifiability issues lead to poor performance. We solve these issues by proposing a novel Coulomb repulsive process (Corp) for locations of points on the manifold, inspired by physical models of electrostatic interactions among particles. Combining this process with a GP prior for the mapping function yields a novel electrostatic GP (electroGP) process. Focusing on the simple case of a one-dimensional manifold, we develop efficient inference algorithms, and illustrate substantially improved performance in a variety of experiments including filling in missing frames in video."}
{"text": "  We introduce GAMSEL (Generalized Additive Model Selection), a penalized likelihood approach for fitting sparse generalized additive models in high dimension. Our method interpolates between null, linear and additive models by allowing the effect of each variable to be estimated as being either zero, linear, or a low-complexity curve, as determined by the data. We present a blockwise coordinate descent procedure for efficiently optimizing the penalized likelihood objective over a dense grid of the tuning parameter, producing a regularization path of additive models. We demonstrate the performance of our method on both real and simulated data examples, and compare it with existing techniques for additive model selection."}
{"text": "  Over the past years Robust PCA has been established as a standard tool for reliable low-rank approximation of matrices in the presence of outliers. Recently, the Robust PCA approach via nuclear norm minimization has been extended to matrices with linear structures which appear in applications such as system identification and data series analysis. At the same time it has been shown how to control the rank of a structured approximation via matrix factorization approaches. The drawbacks of these methods either lie in the lack of robustness against outliers or in their static nature of repeated batch-processing. We present a Robust Structured Low-Rank Approximation method on the Grassmannian that on the one hand allows for fast re-initialization in an online setting due to subspace identification with manifolds, and that is robust against outliers due to a smooth approximation of the $\\ell_p$-norm cost function on the other hand. The method is evaluated in online time series forecasting tasks on simulated and real-world data."}
{"text": "  Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs. Code to replicate each experiment in this paper will be available shortly."}
{"text": "  Mean field variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation method due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, it is well known that a major failing of MFVB is that it underestimates the uncertainty of model variables (sometimes severely) and provides no information about model variable covariance.   We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables---both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both simulated and real data."}
{"text": "  The latent block model (LBM) is a flexible probabilistic tool to describe interactions between node sets in bipartite networks, but it does not account for interactions of time varying intensity between nodes in unknown classes. In this paper we propose a non stationary temporal extension of the LBM that clusters simultaneously the two node sets of a bipartite network and constructs classes of time intervals on which interactions are stationary. The number of clusters as well as the membership to classes are obtained by maximizing the exact complete-data integrated likelihood relying on a greedy search approach. Experiments on simulated and real data are carried out in order to assess the proposed methodology."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a novel spectral algorithm with additive clustering designed to identify overlapping communities in networks. The algorithm is based on geometric properties of the spectrum of the expected adjacency matrix in a random graph model that we call stochastic blockmodel with overlap (SBMO). An adaptive version of the algorithm, that does not require the knowledge of the number of hidden communities, is proved to be consistent under the SBMO when the degrees in the graph are (slightly more than) logarithmic. The algorithm is shown to perform well on simulated data and on real-world graphs with known overlapping communities."}

{"text": "  This paper studies the generalization performance of multi-class classification algorithms, for which we obtain, for the first time, a data-dependent generalization error bound with a logarithmic dependence on the class size, substantially improving the state-of-the-art linear dependence in the existing data-dependent generalization analysis. The theoretical analysis motivates us to introduce a new multi-class classification machine based on $\\ell_p$-norm regularization, where the parameter $p$ controls the complexity of the corresponding bounds. We derive an efficient optimization algorithm based on Fenchel duality theory. Benchmarks on several real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant accuracy gains over the state of the art."}

{"text": "  In this paper, we propose an online algorithm to compute matrix factorizations. Proposed algorithm updates the dictionary matrix and associated coefficients using a single observation at each time. The algorithm performs low-rank updates to dictionary matrix. We derive the algorithm by defining a simple objective function to minimize whenever an observation is arrived. We extend the algorithm further for handling missing data. We also provide a mini-batch extension which enables to compute the matrix factorization on big datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on a real dataset and give comparisons with well-known algorithms such as stochastic gradient matrix factorization and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)."}
{"text": "  This work builds upon previous efforts in online incremental learning, namely the Incremental Gaussian Mixture Network (IGMN). The IGMN is capable of learning from data streams in a single-pass by improving its model after analyzing each data point and discarding it thereafter. Nevertheless, it suffers from the scalability point-of-view, due to its asymptotic time complexity of $\\operatorname{O}\\bigl(NKD^3\\bigr)$ for $N$ data points, $K$ Gaussian components and $D$ dimensions, rendering it inadequate for high-dimensional data. In this paper, we manage to reduce this complexity to $\\operatorname{O}\\bigl(NKD^2\\bigr)$ by deriving formulas for working directly with precision matrices instead of covariance matrices. The final result is a much faster and scalable algorithm which can be applied to high dimensional tasks. This is confirmed by applying the modified algorithm to high-dimensional classification datasets."}
{"text": "  The online learning of deep neural networks is an interesting problem of machine learning because, for example, major IT companies want to manage the information of the massive data uploaded on the web daily, and this technology can contribute to the next generation of lifelong learning. We aim to train deep models from new data that consists of new classes, distributions, and tasks at minimal computational cost, which we call online deep learning. Unfortunately, deep neural network learning through classical online and incremental methods does not work well in both theory and practice. In this paper, we introduce dual memory architectures for online incremental deep learning. The proposed architecture consists of deep representation learners and fast learnable shallow kernel networks, both of which synergize to track the information of new data. During the training phase, we use various online, incremental ensemble, and transfer learning techniques in order to achieve lower error of the architecture. On the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet image recognition tasks, the proposed dual memory architectures performs much better than the classical online and incremental ensemble algorithm, and their accuracies are similar to that of the batch learner."}
{"text": "  We present doubly stochastic gradient MCMC, a simple and generic method for (approximate) Bayesian inference of deep generative models (DGMs) in a collapsed continuous parameter space. At each MCMC sampling step, the algorithm randomly draws a mini-batch of data samples to estimate the gradient of log-posterior and further estimates the intractable expectation over hidden variables via a neural adaptive importance sampler, where the proposal distribution is parameterized by a deep neural network and learnt jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness on learning various DGMs in a wide range of tasks, including density estimation, data generation and missing data imputation. Our method outperforms many state-of-the-art competitors."}
{"text": "  Deep directed generative models have attracted much attention recently due to their expressive representation power and the ability of ancestral sampling. One major difficulty of learning directed models with many latent variables is the intractable inference. To address this problem, most existing algorithms make assumptions to render the latent variables independent of each other, either by designing specific priors, or by approximating the true posterior using a factorized distribution. We believe the correlations among latent variables are crucial for faithful data representation. Driven by this idea, we propose an inference method based on the conditional pseudo-likelihood that preserves the dependencies among the latent variables. For learning, we propose to employ the hard Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which avoids the intractability of the traditional EM by max-out instead of sum-out to compute the data likelihood. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our model against state of the art deep models on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in data representation and reconstruction."}
{"text": "  We propose a class of nonparametric two-sample tests with a cost linear in the sample size. Two tests are given, both based on an ensemble of distances between analytic functions representing each of the distributions. The first test uses smoothed empirical characteristic functions to represent the distributions, the second uses distribution embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Analyticity implies that differences in the distributions may be detected almost surely at a finite number of randomly chosen locations/frequencies. The new tests are consistent against a larger class of alternatives than the previous linear-time tests based on the (non-smoothed) empirical characteristic functions, while being much faster than the current state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based or energy distance-based tests. Experiments on artificial benchmarks and on challenging real-world testing problems demonstrate that our tests give a better power/time tradeoff than competing approaches, and in some cases, better outright power than even the most expensive quadratic-time tests. This performance advantage is retained even in high dimensions, and in cases where the difference in distributions is not observable with low order statistics."}
{"text": "  We consider stochastic sequential learning problems where the learner can observe the \\textit{average reward of several actions}. Such a setting is interesting in many applications involving monitoring and surveillance, where the set of the actions to observe represent some (geographical) area. The importance of this setting is that in these applications, it is actually \\textit{cheaper} to observe average reward of a group of actions rather than the reward of a single action. We show that when the reward is \\textit{smooth} over a given graph representing the neighboring actions, we can maximize the cumulative reward of learning while \\textit{minimizing the sensing cost}. In this paper we propose CheapUCB, an algorithm that matches the regret guarantees of the known algorithms for this setting and at the same time guarantees a linear cost again over them. As a by-product of our analysis, we establish a $\\Omega(\\sqrt{dT})$ lower bound on the cumulative regret of spectral bandits for a class of graphs with effective dimension $d$."}
{"text": "  We extend the theory of boosting for regression problems to the online learning setting. Generalizing from the batch setting for boosting, the notion of a weak learning algorithm is modeled as an online learning algorithm with linear loss functions that competes with a base class of regression functions, while a strong learning algorithm is an online learning algorithm with convex loss functions that competes with a larger class of regression functions. Our main result is an online gradient boosting algorithm which converts a weak online learning algorithm into a strong one where the larger class of functions is the linear span of the base class. We also give a simpler boosting algorithm that converts a weak online learning algorithm into a strong one where the larger class of functions is the convex hull of the base class, and prove its optimality."}
{"text": "  We study supervised learning problems using clustering constraints to impose structure on either features or samples, seeking to help both prediction and interpretation. The problem of clustering features arises naturally in text classification for instance, to reduce dimensionality by grouping words together and identify synonyms. The sample clustering problem on the other hand, applies to multiclass problems where we are allowed to make multiple predictions and the performance of the best answer is recorded. We derive a unified optimization formulation highlighting the common structure of these problems and produce algorithms whose core iteration complexity amounts to a k-means clustering step, which can be approximated efficiently. We extend these results to combine sparsity and clustering constraints, and develop a new projection algorithm on the set of clustered sparse vectors. We prove convergence of our algorithms on random instances, based on a union of subspaces interpretation of the clustering structure. Finally, we test the robustness of our methods on artificial data sets as well as real data extracted from movie reviews."}
{"text": "  Most work in the area of statistical relational learning (SRL) is focussed on discrete data, even though a few approaches for hybrid SRL models have been proposed that combine numerical and discrete variables. In this paper we distinguish numerical random variables for which a probability distribution is defined by the model from numerical input variables that are only used for conditioning the distribution of discrete response variables. We show how numerical input relations can very easily be used in the Relational Bayesian Network framework, and that existing inference and learning methods need only minor adjustments to be applied in this generalized setting. The resulting framework provides natural relational extensions of classical probabilistic models for categorical data. We demonstrate the usefulness of RBN models with numeric input relations by several examples.   In particular, we use the augmented RBN framework to define probabilistic models for multi-relational (social) networks in which the probability of a link between two nodes depends on numeric latent feature vectors associated with the nodes. A generic learning procedure can be used to obtain a maximum-likelihood fit of model parameters and latent feature values for a variety of models that can be expressed in the high-level RBN representation. Specifically, we propose a model that allows us to interpret learned latent feature values as community centrality degrees by which we can identify nodes that are central for one community, that are hubs between communities, or that are isolated nodes. In a multi-relational setting, the model also provides a characterization of how different relations are associated with each community."}
{"text": "  People believe that depth plays an important role in success of deep neural networks (DNN). However, this belief lacks solid theoretical justifications as far as we know. We investigate role of depth from perspective of margin bound. In margin bound, expected error is upper bounded by empirical margin error plus Rademacher Average (RA) based capacity term. First, we derive an upper bound for RA of DNN, and show that it increases with increasing depth. This indicates negative impact of depth on test performance. Second, we show that deeper networks tend to have larger representation power (measured by Betti numbers based complexity) than shallower networks in multi-class setting, and thus can lead to smaller empirical margin error. This implies positive impact of depth. The combination of these two results shows that for DNN with restricted number of hidden units, increasing depth is not always good since there is a tradeoff between positive and negative impacts. These results inspire us to seek alternative ways to achieve positive impact of depth, e.g., imposing margin-based penalty terms to cross entropy loss so as to reduce empirical margin error without increasing depth. Our experiments show that in this way, we achieve significantly better test performance."}
{"text": "  In a variety of problems originating in supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, the loss function is defined by an expectation over a collection of random variables, which might be part of a probabilistic model or the external world. Estimating the gradient of this loss function, using samples, lies at the core of gradient-based learning algorithms for these problems. We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs---directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions---and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function's gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The generic scheme we propose unifies estimators derived in variety of prior work, along with variance-reduction techniques therein. It could assist researchers in developing intricate models involving a combination of stochastic and deterministic operations, enabling, for example, attention, memory, and control actions."}
{"text": "  The statistical dependencies which independent component analysis (ICA) cannot remove often provide rich information beyond the linear independent components. It would thus be very useful to estimate the dependency structure from data. While such models have been proposed, they usually concentrated on higher-order correlations such as energy (square) correlations. Yet, linear correlations are a most fundamental and informative form of dependency in many real data sets. Linear correlations are usually completely removed by ICA and related methods, so they can only be analyzed by developing new methods which explicitly allow for linearly correlated components. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model of linear non-Gaussian components which are allowed to have both linear and energy correlations. The precision matrix of the linear components is assumed to be randomly generated by a higher-order process and explicitly parametrized by a parameter matrix. The estimation of the parameter matrix is shown to be particularly simple because using score matching, the objective function is a quadratic form. Using simulations with artificial data, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves identifiability of non-Gaussian components by simultaneously learning their correlation structure. Applications on simulated complex cells with natural image input, as well as spectrograms of natural audio data show that the method finds new kinds of dependencies between the components."}
{"text": "  We present and empirically evaluate an efficient algorithm that learns to aggregate the predictions of an ensemble of binary classifiers. The algorithm uses the structure of the ensemble predictions on unlabeled data to yield significant performance improvements. It does this without making assumptions on the structure or origin of the ensemble, without parameters, and as scalably as linear learning. We empirically demonstrate these performance gains with random forests."}
{"text": "  Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions. For example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children's names in a given state and year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions. In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency between the draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the preceding nucleotides, children's names are highly correlated from year to year, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic. These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here, we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in P\\'olya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead."}
{"text": "  Nonparametric extension of tensor regression is proposed. Nonlinearity in a high-dimensional tensor space is broken into simple local functions by incorporating low-rank tensor decomposition. Compared to naive nonparametric approaches, our formulation considerably improves the convergence rate of estimation while maintaining consistency with the same function class under specific conditions. To estimate local functions, we develop a Bayesian estimator with the Gaussian process prior. Experimental results show its theoretical properties and high performance in terms of predicting a summary statistic of a real complex network."}
{"text": "  It is often desirable to be able to recognize when inputs to a recognition function learned in a supervised manner correspond to classes unseen at training time. With this ability, new class labels could be assigned to these inputs by a human operator, allowing them to be incorporated into the recognition function --- ideally under an efficient incremental update mechanism. While good algorithms that assume inputs from a fixed set of classes exist, e.g., artificial neural networks and kernel machines, it is not immediately obvious how to extend them to perform incremental learning in the presence of unknown query classes. Existing algorithms take little to no distributional information into account when learning recognition functions and lack a strong theoretical foundation. We address this gap by formulating a novel, theoretically sound classifier --- the Extreme Value Machine (EVM). The EVM has a well-grounded interpretation derived from statistical Extreme Value Theory (EVT), and is the first classifier to be able to perform nonlinear kernel-free variable bandwidth incremental learning. Compared to other classifiers in the same deep network derived feature space, the EVM is accurate and efficient on an established benchmark partition of the ImageNet dataset."}
{"text": "  Machine learning relies on the assumption that unseen test instances of a classification problem follow the same distribution as observed training data. However, this principle can break down when machine learning is used to make important decisions about the welfare (employment, education, health) of strategic individuals. Knowing information about the classifier, such individuals may manipulate their attributes in order to obtain a better classification outcome. As a result of this behavior---often referred to as gaming---the performance of the classifier may deteriorate sharply. Indeed, gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning methods in practice; in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known as Goodhart's law. In this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms for learning classifiers that are robust to gaming.   We model classification as a sequential game between a player named \"Jury\" and a player named \"Contestant.\" Jury designs a classifier, and Contestant receives an input to the classifier, which he may change at some cost. Jury's goal is to achieve high classification accuracy with respect to Contestant's original input and some underlying target classification function. Contestant's goal is to achieve a favorable classification outcome while taking into account the cost of achieving it.   For a natural class of cost functions, we obtain computationally efficient learning algorithms which are near-optimal. Surprisingly, our algorithms are efficient even on concept classes that are computationally hard to learn. For general cost functions, designing an approximately optimal strategy-proof classifier, for inverse-polynomial approximation, is NP-hard."}
{"text": "  We tackle the problem of learning linear classifiers from noisy datasets in a multiclass setting. The two-class version of this problem was studied a few years ago where the proposed approaches to combat the noise revolve around a Per-ceptron learning scheme fed with peculiar examples computed through a weighted average of points from the noisy training set. We propose to build upon these approaches and we introduce a new algorithm called UMA (for Unconfused Multiclass additive Algorithm) which may be seen as a generalization to the multiclass setting of the previous approaches. In order to characterize the noise we use the confusion matrix as a multiclass extension of the classification noise studied in the aforemen-tioned literature. Theoretically well-founded, UMA furthermore displays very good empirical noise robustness, as evidenced by numerical simulations conducted on both synthetic and real data."}
{"text": "  The computational cost of many signal processing and machine learning techniques is often dominated by the cost of applying certain linear operators to high-dimensional vectors. This paper introduces an algorithm aimed at reducing the complexity of applying linear operators in high dimension by approximately factorizing the corresponding matrix into few sparse factors. The approach relies on recent advances in non-convex optimization. It is first explained and analyzed in details and then demonstrated experimentally on various problems including dictionary learning for image denoising, and the approximation of large matrices arising in inverse problems."}
{"text": "  Stochastic algorithms are efficient approaches to solving machine learning and optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a general framework called Splash for parallelizing stochastic algorithms on multi-node distributed systems. Splash consists of a programming interface and an execution engine. Using the programming interface, the user develops sequential stochastic algorithms without concerning any detail about distributed computing. The algorithm is then automatically parallelized by a communication-efficient execution engine. We provide theoretical justifications on the optimal rate of convergence for parallelizing stochastic gradient descent. Splash is built on top of Apache Spark. The real-data experiments on logistic regression, collaborative filtering and topic modeling verify that Splash yields order-of-magnitude speedup over single-thread stochastic algorithms and over state-of-the-art implementations on Spark."}
{"text": "  We discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for an auto-encoder to define a conservative vector field, in which case it is associated with an energy function akin to the unnormalized log-probability of the data. We show that the conditions for conservativeness are more general than for encoder and decoder weights to be the same (\"tied weights\"), and that they also depend on the form of the hidden unit activation function, but that contractive training criteria, such as denoising, will enforce these conditions locally. Based on these observations, we show how we can use auto-encoders to extract the conservative component of a vector field."}
{"text": "  We present a technique for clustering categorical data by generating many dissimilarity matrices and averaging over them. We begin by demonstrating our technique on low dimensional categorical data and comparing it to several other techniques that have been proposed. Then we give conditions under which our method should yield good results in general. Our method extends to high dimensional categorical data of equal lengths by ensembling over many choices of explanatory variables. In this context we compare our method with two other methods. Finally, we extend our method to high dimensional categorical data vectors of unequal length by using alignment techniques to equalize the lengths. We give examples to show that our method continues to provide good results, in particular, better in the context of genome sequences than clusterings suggested by phylogenetic trees."}
{"text": "  Given a family of probability measures in P(X), the space of probability measures on a Hilbert space X, our goal in this paper is to highlight one ore more curves in P(X) that summarize efficiently that family. We propose to study this problem under the optimal transport (Wasserstein) geometry, using curves that are restricted to be geodesic segments under that metric. We show that concepts that play a key role in Euclidean PCA, such as data centering or orthogonality of principal directions, find a natural equivalent in the optimal transport geometry, using Wasserstein means and differential geometry. The implementation of these ideas is, however, computationally challenging. To achieve scalable algorithms that can handle thousands of measures, we propose to use a relaxed definition for geodesics and regularized optimal transport distances. The interest of our approach is demonstrated on images seen either as shapes or color histograms."}
{"text": "  Factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs) are powerful tools of modeling sequential data. Learning FHMMs yields a challenging simultaneous model selection issue, i.e., selecting the number of multiple Markov chains and the dimensionality of each chain. Our main contribution is to address this model selection issue by extending Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference to FHMMs. First, we offer a better approximation of marginal log-likelihood than the previous FAB inference. Our key idea is to integrate out transition probabilities, yet still apply the Laplace approximation to emission probabilities. Second, we prove that if there are two very similar hidden states in an FHMM, i.e. one is redundant, then FAB will almost surely shrink and eliminate one of them, making the model parsimonious. Experimental results show that FAB for FHMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art nonparametric Bayesian iFHMM and Variational FHMM in model selection accuracy, with competitive held-out perplexity."}
{"text": "  Finding statistically significant high-order interaction features in predictive modeling is important but challenging task. The difficulty lies in the fact that, for a recent applications with high-dimensional covariates, the number of possible high-order interaction features would be extremely large. Identifying statistically significant features from such a huge pool of candidates would be highly challenging both in computational and statistical senses. To work with this problem, we consider a two stage algorithm where we first select a set of high-order interaction features by marginal screening, and then make statistical inferences on the regression model fitted only with the selected features. Such statistical inferences are called post-selection inference (PSI), and receiving an increasing attention in the literature. One of the seminal recent advancements in PSI literature is the works by Lee et al. where the authors presented an algorithmic framework for computing exact sampling distributions in PSI. A main challenge when applying their approach to our high-order interaction models is to cope with the fact that PSI in general depends not only on the selected features but also on the unselected features, making it hard to apply to our extremely high-dimensional high-order interaction models. The goal of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by introducing a novel efficient method for PSI. Our key idea is to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction features, and to develop a pruning method of the tree which enables us to quickly identify a group of unselected features that are guaranteed to have no influence on PSI. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method allows us to reliably identify statistically significant high-order interaction features with reasonable computational cost."}
{"text": "  Taking into account high-order interactions among covariates is valuable in many practical regression problems. This is, however, computationally challenging task because the number of high-order interaction features to be considered would be extremely large unless the number of covariates is sufficiently small. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient algorithm for LASSO-based sparse learning of such high-order interaction models. Our basic strategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently proposed safe feature screening (SFS) rule. An SFS rule has a property that, if a feature satisfies the rule, then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active in the LASSO solution, meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the LASSO training process. If a large number of features can be screened-out before training the LASSO, the computational cost and the memory requirment can be dramatically reduced. However, applying such an SFS rule to each of the extremely large number of high-order interaction features would be computationally infeasible. Our key idea for solving this computational issue is to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction features. Specifically, we introduce a pruning condition called safe feature pruning (SFP) rule which has a property that, if the rule is satisfied in a certain node of the tree, then all the high-order interaction features corresponding to its descendant nodes can be guaranteed to be non-active at the optimal solution. Our algorithm is extremely efficient, making it possible to work, e.g., with 3rd order interactions of 10,000 original covariates, where the number of possible high-order interaction features is greater than 10^{12}."}
{"text": "  We present a complimentary objective for training recurrent neural networks (RNN) with gating units that helps with regularization and interpretability of the trained model. Attention-based RNN models have shown success in many difficult sequence to sequence classification problems with long and short term dependencies, however these models are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we describe how to regularize these models through an L1 penalty on the activation of the gating units, and show that this technique reduces overfitting on a variety of tasks while also providing to us a human-interpretable visualization of the inputs used by the network. These tasks include sentiment analysis, paraphrase recognition, and question answering."}
{"text": "  Kernel methods are ubiquitous tools in machine learning. However, there is often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori. Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a $N \\times N$ Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of $N$ instances. The computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct application of kernel methods on large datasets, and makes kernel learning especially difficult. In this paper we introduce Bayesian nonparmetric kernel-learning (BaNK), a generic, data-driven framework for scalable learning of kernels. BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral distribution of random frequencies allowing it to both learn kernels and scale to large datasets. We show that this framework can be used for large scale regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that BaNK outperforms several other scalable approaches for kernel learning on a variety of real world datasets."}
{"text": "  Factorized Information Criterion (FIC) is a recently developed information criterion, based on which a novel model selection methodology, namely Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) Inference, has been developed and successfully applied to various hierarchical Bayesian models. The Dirichlet Process (DP) prior, and one of its well known representations, the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), derive another line of model selection methods. FIC can be viewed as a prior distribution over the latent variable configurations. Under this view, we prove that when the parameter dimensionality $D_{c}=2$, FIC is equivalent to CRP. We argue that when $D_{c}>2$, FIC avoids an inherent problem of DP/CRP, i.e. the data likelihood will dominate the impact of the prior, and thus the model selection capability will weaken as $D_{c}$ increases. However, FIC overestimates the data likelihood. As a result, FIC may be overly biased towards models with less components. We propose a natural generalization of FIC, which finds a middle ground between CRP and FIC, and may yield more accurate model selection results than FIC."}
{"text": "  We study the Gaussian Process regression model in the context of training data with noise in both input and output. The presence of two sources of noise makes the task of learning accurate predictive models extremely challenging. However, in some instances additional constraints may be available that can reduce the uncertainty in the resulting predictive models. In particular, we consider the case of monotonically ordered latent input, which occurs in many application domains that deal with temporal data. We present a novel inference and learning approach based on non-parametric Gaussian variational approximation to learn the GP model while taking into account the new constraints. The resulting strategy allows one to gain access to posterior estimates of both the input and the output and results in improved predictive performance. We compare our proposed models to state-of-the-art Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) and other competing approaches on synthetic and real sea-level rise data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach consistently outperforms selected methods while, at the same time, reducing the computational costs of learning and inference."}
{"text": "  Feature selection in learning to rank has recently emerged as a crucial issue. Whereas several preprocessing approaches have been proposed, only a few works have been focused on integrating the feature selection into the learning process. In this work, we propose a general framework for feature selection in learning to rank using SVM with a sparse regularization term. We investigate both classical convex regularizations such as $\\ell\\_1$ or weighted $\\ell\\_1$ and non-convex regularization terms such as log penalty, Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP) or $\\ell\\_p$ pseudo norm with $p\\textless{}1$. Two algorithms are proposed, first an accelerated proximal approach for solving the convex problems, second a reweighted $\\ell\\_1$ scheme to address the non-convex regularizations. We conduct intensive experiments on nine datasets from Letor 3.0 and Letor 4.0 corpora. Numerical results show that the use of non-convex regularizations we propose leads to more sparsity in the resulting models while prediction performance is preserved. The number of features is decreased by up to a factor of six compared to the $\\ell\\_1$ regularization. In addition, the software is publicly available on the web."}
{"text": "  Domain adaptation from one data space (or domain) to another is one of the most challenging tasks of modern data analytics. If the adaptation is done correctly, models built on a specific data space become more robust when confronted to data depicting the same semantic concepts (the classes), but observed by another observation system with its own specificities. Among the many strategies proposed to adapt a domain to another, finding a common representation has shown excellent properties: by finding a common representation for both domains, a single classifier can be effective in both and use labelled samples from the source domain to predict the unlabelled samples of the target domain. In this paper, we propose a regularized unsupervised optimal transportation model to perform the alignment of the representations in the source and target domains. We learn a transportation plan matching both PDFs, which constrains labelled samples in the source domain to remain close during transport. This way, we exploit at the same time the few labeled information in the source and the unlabelled distributions observed in both domains. Experiments in toy and challenging real visual adaptation examples show the interest of the method, that consistently outperforms state of the art approaches."}
{"text": "  A new Bayesian approach to linear system identification has been proposed in a series of recent papers. The main idea is to frame linear system identification as predictor estimation in an infinite dimensional space, with the aid of regularization/Bayesian techniques. This approach guarantees the identification of stable predictors based on the prediction error minimization. Unluckily, the stability of the predictors does not guarantee the stability of the impulse response of the system. In this paper we propose and compare various techniques to address this issue. Simulations results comparing these techniques will be provided."}

{"text": "  This paper proposes a novel Gaussian process approach to fault removal in time-series data. Fault removal does not delete the faulty signal data but, instead, massages the fault from the data. We assume that only one fault occurs at any one time and model the signal by two separate non-parametric Gaussian process models for both the physical phenomenon and the fault. In order to facilitate fault removal we introduce the Markov Region Link kernel for handling non-stationary Gaussian processes. This kernel is piece-wise stationary but guarantees that functions generated by it and their derivatives (when required) are everywhere continuous. We apply this kernel to the removal of drift and bias errors in faulty sensor data and also to the recovery of EOG artifact corrupted EEG signals."}
{"text": "  Kernel Bayes' rule has been proposed as a nonparametric kernel-based method to realize Bayesian inference in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the prediction result by kernel Bayes' rule is in some cases unnatural. We consider that this phenomenon is in part due to the fact that the assumptions in kernel Bayes' rule do not hold in general."}
{"text": "  In Gold's framework of inductive inference, the model of partial learning requires the learner to output exactly one correct index for the target object and only the target object infinitely often. Since infinitely many of the learner's hypotheses may be incorrect, it is not obvious whether a partial learner can be modifed to \"approximate\" the target object.   Fulk and Jain (Approximate inference and scientific method. Information and Computation 114(2):179--191, 1994) introduced a model of approximate learning of recursive functions. The present work extends their research and solves an open problem of Fulk and Jain by showing that there is a learner which approximates and partially identifies every recursive function by outputting a sequence of hypotheses which, in addition, are also almost all finite variants of the target function.   The subsequent study is dedicated to the question how these findings generalise to the learning of r.e. languages from positive data. Here three variants of approximate learning will be introduced and investigated with respect to the question whether they can be combined with partial learning. Following the line of Fulk and Jain's research, further investigations provide conditions under which partial language learners can eventually output only finite variants of the target language. The combinabilities of other partial learning criteria will also be briefly studied."}

{"text": "  The dictionary-aided sparse regression (SR) approach has recently emerged as a promising alternative to hyperspectral unmixing (HU) in remote sensing. By using an available spectral library as a dictionary, the SR approach identifies the underlying materials in a given hyperspectral image by selecting a small subset of spectral samples in the dictionary to represent the whole image. A drawback with the current SR developments is that an actual spectral signature in the scene is often assumed to have zero mismatch with its corresponding dictionary sample, and such an assumption is considered too ideal in practice. In this paper, we tackle the spectral signature mismatch problem by proposing a dictionary-adjusted nonconvex sparsity-encouraging regression (DANSER) framework. The main idea is to incorporate dictionary correcting variables in an SR formulation. A simple and low per-iteration complexity algorithm is tailor-designed for practical realization of DANSER. Using the same dictionary correcting idea, we also propose a robust subspace solution for dictionary pruning. Extensive simulations and real-data experiments show that the proposed method is effective in mitigating the undesirable spectral signature mismatch effects."}
{"text": "  We propose a Bayesian approach for recursively estimating the classifier weights in online learning of a classifier ensemble. In contrast with past methods, such as stochastic gradient descent or online boosting, our approach estimates the weights by recursively updating its posterior distribution. For a specified class of loss functions, we show that it is possible to formulate a suitably defined likelihood function and hence use the posterior distribution as an approximation to the global empirical loss minimizer. If the stream of training data is sampled from a stationary process, we can also show that our approach admits a superior rate of convergence to the expected loss minimizer than is possible with standard stochastic gradient descent. In experiments with real-world datasets, our formulation often performs better than state-of-the-art stochastic gradient descent and online boosting algorithms."}
{"text": "  Kernel methods are considered an effective technique for on-line learning. Many approaches have been developed for compactly representing the dual solution of a kernel method when the problem imposes memory constraints. However, in literature no work is specifically tailored to streams of graphs. Motivated by the fact that the size of the feature space representation of many state-of-the-art graph kernels is relatively small and thus it is explicitly computable, we study whether executing kernel algorithms in the feature space can be more effective than the classical dual approach. We study three different algorithms and various strategies for managing the budget. Efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approaches are experimentally assessed on relatively large graph streams exhibiting concept drift. It turns out that, when strict memory budget constraints have to be enforced, working in feature space, given the current state of the art on graph kernels, is more than a viable alternative to dual approaches, both in terms of speed and classification performance."}
{"text": "  Graph kernels are usually defined in terms of simpler kernels over local substructures of the original graphs. Different kernels consider different types of substructures. However, in some cases they have similar predictive performances, probably because the substructures can be interpreted as approximations of the subgraphs they induce. In this paper, we propose to associate to each feature a piece of information about the context in which the feature appears in the graph. A substructure appearing in two different graphs will match only if it appears with the same context in both graphs. We propose a kernel based on this idea that considers trees as substructures, and where the contexts are features too. The kernel is inspired from the framework in [6], even if it is not part of it. We give an efficient algorithm for computing the kernel and show promising results on real-world graph classification datasets."}

{"text": "  Many statistical methods for network data parameterize the edge-probability by attributing latent traits to the vertices such as block structure and assume exchangeability in the sense of the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem. Empirical studies of networks indicate that many real-world networks have a power-law distribution of the vertices which in turn implies the number of edges scale slower than quadratically in the number of vertices. These assumptions are fundamentally irreconcilable as the Aldous-Hoover theorem implies quadratic scaling of the number of edges. Recently Caron and Fox (2014) proposed the use of a different notion of exchangeability due to Kallenberg (2009) and obtained a network model which admits power-law behaviour while retaining desirable statistical properties, however this model does not capture latent vertex traits such as block-structure. In this work we re-introduce the use of block-structure for network models obeying Kallenberg's notion of exchangeability and thereby obtain a model which admits the inference of block-structure and edge inhomogeneity. We derive a simple expression for the likelihood and an efficient sampling method. The obtained model is not significantly more difficult to implement than existing approaches to block-modelling and performs well on real network datasets."}
{"text": "  We consider stochastic smoothing of spectral functions of matrices using perturbations commonly studied in random matrix theory. We show that a spectral function remains spectral when smoothed using a unitarily invariant perturbation distribution. We then derive state-of-the-art smoothing bounds for the maximum eigenvalue function using the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). Smoothing the maximum eigenvalue function is important for applications in semidefinite optimization and online learning. As a direct consequence of our GOE smoothing results, we obtain an $O((N \\log N)^{1/4} \\sqrt{T})$ expected regret bound for the online variance minimization problem using an algorithm that performs only a single maximum eigenvector computation per time step. Here $T$ is the number of rounds and $N$ is the matrix dimension. Our algorithm and its analysis also extend to the more general online PCA problem where the learner has to output a rank $k$ subspace. The algorithm just requires computing $k$ maximum eigenvectors per step and enjoys an $O(k (N \\log N)^{1/4} \\sqrt{T})$ expected regret bound."}
{"text": "  Random survival forests (RSF) are a powerful method for risk prediction of right-censored outcomes in biomedical research. RSF use the log-rank split criterion to form an ensemble of survival trees. The most common approach to evaluate the prediction accuracy of a RSF model is Harrell's concordance index for survival data ('C index'). Conceptually, this strategy implies that the split criterion in RSF is different from the evaluation criterion of interest. This discrepancy can be overcome by using Harrell's C for both node splitting and evaluation. We compare the difference between the two split criteria analytically and in simulation studies with respect to the preference of more unbalanced splits, termed end-cut preference (ECP). Specifically, we show that the log-rank statistic has a stronger ECP compared to the C index. In simulation studies and with the help of two medical data sets we demonstrate that the accuracy of RSF predictions, as measured by Harrell's C, can be improved if the log-rank statistic is replaced by the C index for node splitting. This is especially true in situations where the censoring rate or the fraction of informative continuous predictor variables is high. Conversely, log-rank splitting is preferable in noisy scenarios. Both C-based and log-rank splitting are implemented in the R~package ranger. We recommend Harrell's C as split criterion for use in smaller scale clinical studies and the log-rank split criterion for use in large-scale 'omics' studies."}
{"text": "  The fields of machine learning and mathematical optimization increasingly intertwined. The special topic on supervised learning and convex optimization examines this interplay. The training part of most supervised learning algorithms can usually be reduced to an optimization problem that minimizes a loss between model predictions and training data. While most optimization techniques focus on accuracy and speed of convergence, the qualities of good optimization algorithm from the machine learning perspective can be quite different since machine learning is more than fitting the data. Better optimization algorithms that minimize the training loss can possibly give very poor generalization performance. In this paper, we examine a particular kind of machine learning algorithm, boosting, whose training process can be viewed as functional coordinate descent on the exponential loss. We study the relation between optimization techniques and machine learning by implementing a new boosting algorithm. DABoost, based on dual-averaging scheme and study its generalization performance. We show that DABoost, although slower in reducing the training error, in general enjoys a better generalization error than AdaBoost."}
{"text": "  Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aims to factorize a matrix into two optimized nonnegative matrices appropriate for the intended applications. The method has been widely used for unsupervised learning tasks, including recommender systems (rating matrix of users by items) and document clustering (weighting matrix of papers by keywords). However, traditional NMF methods typically assume the number of latent factors (i.e., dimensionality of the loading matrices) to be fixed. This assumption makes them inflexible for many applications. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric NMF framework to mitigate this issue by using dependent Indian Buffet Processes (dIBP). In a nutshell, we apply a correlation function for the generation of two stick weights associated with each pair of columns of loading matrices, while still maintaining their respective marginal distribution specified by IBP. As a consequence, the generation of two loading matrices will be column-wise (indirectly) correlated. Under this same framework, two classes of correlation function are proposed (1) using Bivariate beta distribution and (2) using Copula function. Both methods allow us to adopt our work for various applications by flexibly choosing an appropriate parameter settings. Compared with the other state-of-the art approaches in this area, such as using Gaussian Process (GP)-based dIBP, our work is seen to be much more flexible in terms of allowing the two corresponding binary matrix columns to have greater variations in their non-zero entries. Our experiments on the real-world and synthetic datasets show that three proposed models perform well on the document clustering task comparing standard NMF without predefining the dimension for the factor matrices, and the Bivariate beta distribution-based and Copula-based models have better flexibility than the GP-based model."}
{"text": "  Networks capture our intuition about relationships in the world. They describe the friendships between Facebook users, interactions in financial markets, and synapses connecting neurons in the brain. These networks are richly structured with cliques of friends, sectors of stocks, and a smorgasbord of cell types that govern how neurons connect. Some networks, like social network friendships, can be directly observed, but in many cases we only have an indirect view of the network through the actions of its constituents and an understanding of how the network mediates that activity. In this work, we focus on the problem of latent network discovery in the case where the observable activity takes the form of a mutually-excitatory point process known as a Hawkes process. We build on previous work that has taken a Bayesian approach to this problem, specifying prior distributions over the latent network structure and a likelihood of observed activity given this network. We extend this work by proposing a discrete-time formulation and developing a computationally efficient stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm that allows us to scale the approach to long sequences of observations. We demonstrate our algorithm on the calcium imaging data used in the Chalearn neural connectomics challenge."}
{"text": "  Linear regression models depend directly on the design matrix and its properties. Techniques that efficiently estimate model coefficients by partitioning rows of the design matrix are increasingly popular for large-scale problems because they fit well with modern parallel computing architectures. We propose a simple measure of {\\em concordance} between a design matrix and a subset of its rows that estimates how well a subset captures the variance-covariance structure of a larger data set. We illustrate the use of this measure in a heuristic method for selecting row partition sizes that balance statistical and computational efficiency goals in real-world problems."}
{"text": "  Predicting the future location of users in wireless net- works has numerous applications, and can help service providers to improve the quality of service perceived by their clients. The location predictors proposed so far estimate the next location of a specific user by inspecting the past individual trajectories of this user. As a consequence, when the training data collected for a given user is limited, the resulting prediction is inaccurate. In this paper, we develop cluster-aided predictors that exploit past trajectories collected from all users to predict the next location of a given user. These predictors rely on clustering techniques and extract from the training data similarities among the mobility patterns of the various users to improve the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we present CAMP (Cluster-Aided Mobility Predictor), a cluster-aided predictor whose design is based on recent non-parametric bayesian statistical tools. CAMP is robust and adaptive in the sense that it exploits similarities in users' mobility only if such similarities are really present in the training data. We analytically prove the consistency of the predictions provided by CAMP, and investigate its performance using two large-scale datasets. CAMP significantly outperforms existing predictors, and in particular those that only exploit individual past trajectories."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we show how the Ordered Decomposition DAGs (ODD) kernel framework, a framework that allows the definition of graph kernels from tree kernels, allows to easily define new state-of-the-art graph kernels. Here we consider a fast graph kernel based on the Subtree kernel (ST), and we propose various enhancements to increase its expressiveness. The proposed DAG kernel has the same worst-case complexity as the one based on ST, but an improved expressivity due to an augmented set of features. Moreover, we propose a novel weighting scheme for the features, which can be applied to other kernels of the ODD framework. These improvements allow the proposed kernels to improve on the classification performances of the ST-based kernel for several real-world datasets, reaching state-of-the-art performances."}
{"text": "  It is well known that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can learn deterministic automata. Learning nondeterministic automata is another matter. This is important because much of the world is nondeterministic, taking the form of unpredictable or probabilistic events that must be acted upon. If ANNs are to engage such phenomena, then they must be able to learn how to deal with nondeterminism. In this project the game of Pong poses a nondeterministic environment. The learner is given an incomplete view of the game state and underlying deterministic physics, resulting in a nondeterministic game. Three models were trained and tested on the game: Mona, Elman, and Numenta's NuPIC."}
{"text": "  We consider factoring low-rank tensors in the presence of outlying slabs. This problem is important in practice, because data collected in many real-world applications, such as speech, fluorescence, and some social network data, fit this paradigm. Prior work tackles this problem by iteratively selecting a fixed number of slabs and fitting, a procedure which may not converge. We formulate this problem from a group-sparsity promoting point of view, and propose an alternating optimization framework to handle the corresponding $\\ell_p$ ($0<p\\leq 1$) minimization-based low-rank tensor factorization problem. The proposed algorithm features a similar per-iteration complexity as the plain trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is also easy to analyze under the framework of alternating optimization and its variants. In addition, regularization and constraints can be easily incorporated to make use of \\emph{a priori} information on the latent loading factors. Simulations and real data experiments on blind speech separation, fluorescence data analysis, and social network mining are used to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  This work provides two statistical Gaussian forecasting methods for predicting First Daily Departure Times (FDDTs) of everyday use electric vehicles. This is important in smart grid applications to understand disconnection times of such mobile storage units, for instance to forecast storage of non dispatchable loads (e.g. wind and solar power). We provide a review of the relevant state-of-the-art driving behavior features towards FDDT prediction, to then propose an approximated Gaussian method which qualitatively forecasts how many vehicles will depart within a given time frame, by assuming that departure times follow a normal distribution. This method considers sampling sessions as Poisson distributions which are superimposed to obtain a single approximated Gaussian model. Given the Gaussian distribution assumption of the departure times, we also model the problem with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), in which the priorly set number of clusters represents the desired time granularity. Evaluation has proven that for the dataset tested, low error and high confidence ($\\approx 95\\%$) is possible for 15 and 10 minute intervals, and that GMM outperforms traditional modeling but is less generalizable across datasets, as it is a closer fit to the sampling data. Conclusively we discuss future possibilities and practical applications of the discussed model."}
{"text": "  We highlight a pitfall when applying stochastic variational inference to general Bayesian networks. For global random variables approximated by an exponential family distribution, natural gradient steps, commonly starting from a unit length step size, are averaged to convergence. This useful insight into the scaling of initial step sizes is lost when the approximation factorizes across a general Bayesian network, and care must be taken to ensure practical convergence. We experimentally investigate how much of the baby (well-scaled steps) is thrown out with the bath water (exact gradients)."}
{"text": "  Variational methods have been recently considered for scaling the training process of Gaussian process classifiers to large datasets. As an alternative, we describe here how to train these classifiers efficiently using expectation propagation. The proposed method allows for handling datasets with millions of data instances. More precisely, it can be used for (i) training in a distributed fashion where the data instances are sent to different nodes in which the required computations are carried out, and for (ii) maximizing an estimate of the marginal likelihood using a stochastic approximation of the gradient. Several experiments indicate that the method described is competitive with the variational approach."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study the problem of estimating uniformly well the mean values of several distributions given a finite budget of samples. If the variance of the distributions were known, one could design an optimal sampling strategy by collecting a number of independent samples per distribution that is proportional to their variance. However, in the more realistic case where the distributions are not known in advance, one needs to design adaptive sampling strategies in order to select which distribution to sample from according to the previously observed samples. We describe two strategies based on pulling the distributions a number of times that is proportional to a high-probability upper-confidence-bound on their variance (built from previous observed samples) and report a finite-sample performance analysis on the excess estimation error compared to the optimal allocation. We show that the performance of these allocation strategies depends not only on the variances but also on the full shape of the distributions."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a general framework for exploiting the representational capacity of neural networks to approximate complex, nonlinear reward functions in the context of solving the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem. We show in this context that the Maximum Entropy paradigm for IRL lends itself naturally to the efficient training of deep architectures. At test time, the approach leads to a computational complexity independent of the number of demonstrations, which makes it especially well-suited for applications in life-long learning scenarios. Our approach achieves performance commensurate to the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks while exceeding on an alternative benchmark based on highly varying reward structures. Finally, we extend the basic architecture - which is equivalent to a simplified subclass of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with width one - to include larger convolutions in order to eliminate dependency on precomputed spatial features and work on raw input representations."}
{"text": "  We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with non-equivalent multiple plays where, at each step, an agent chooses not only a set of arms, but also their order, which influences reward distribution. In several problem formulations with different assumptions, we provide lower bounds for regret with standard asymptotics $O(\\log{t})$ but novel coefficients and provide optimal algorithms, thus proving that these bounds cannot be improved."}
{"text": "  We introduce incremental variational inference and apply it to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Incremental variational inference is inspired by incremental EM and provides an alternative to stochastic variational inference. Incremental LDA can process massive document collections, does not require to set a learning rate, converges faster to a local optimum of the variational bound and enjoys the attractive property of monotonically increasing it. We study the performance of incremental LDA on large benchmark data sets. We further introduce a stochastic approximation of incremental variational inference which extends to the asynchronous distributed setting. The resulting distributed algorithm achieves comparable performance as single host incremental variational inference, but with a significant speed-up."}
{"text": "  Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) using a sequential Monte Carlo method provides a comprehensive platform for parameter estimation, model selection and sensitivity analysis in differential equations. However, this method, like other Monte Carlo methods, incurs a significant computational cost as it requires explicit numerical integration of differential equations to carry out inference. In this paper we propose a novel method for circumventing the requirement of explicit integration by using derivatives of Gaussian processes to smooth the observations from which parameters are estimated. We evaluate our methods using synthetic data generated from model biological systems described by ordinary and delay differential equations. Upon comparing the performance of our method to existing ABC techniques, we demonstrate that it produces comparably reliable parameter estimates at a significantly reduced execution time."}
{"text": "  The density matrices are positively semi-definite Hermitian matrices of unit trace that describe the state of a quantum system. The goal of the paper is to develop minimax lower bounds on error rates of estimation of low rank density matrices in trace regression models used in quantum state tomography (in particular, in the case of Pauli measurements) with explicit dependence of the bounds on the rank and other complexity parameters. Such bounds are established for several statistically relevant distances, including quantum versions of Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy distance) and of Hellinger distance (so called Bures distance), and Schatten $p$-norm distances. Sharp upper bounds and oracle inequalities for least squares estimator with von Neumann entropy penalization are obtained showing that minimax lower bounds are attained (up to logarithmic factors) for these distances."}
{"text": "  Many modern data analysis problems involve inferences from streaming data. However, streaming data is not easily amenable to the standard probabilistic modeling approaches, which assume that we condition on finite data. We develop population variational Bayes, a new approach for using Bayesian modeling to analyze streams of data. It approximates a new type of distribution, the population posterior, which combines the notion of a population distribution of the data with Bayesian inference in a probabilistic model. We study our method with latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixtures on several large-scale data sets."}
{"text": "  The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension is a combinatorial parameter that reflects the \"complexity\" of a set of sets (a.k.a. concept classes). It has been introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in their seminal 1971 paper and has since found many applications, most notably in machine learning theory and in computational geometry. Arguably the most influential consequence of the VC analysis is the fundamental theorem of statistical machine learning, stating that a concept class is learnable (in some precise sense) if and only if its VC-dimension is finite. Furthermore, for such classes a most simple learning rule - empirical risk minimization (ERM) - is guaranteed to succeed.   The simplest non-trivial structures, in terms of the VC-dimension, are the classes (i.e., sets of subsets) for which that dimension is 1.   In this note we show a couple of curious results concerning such classes. The first result shows that such classes share a very simple structure, and, as a corollary, the labeling information contained in any sample labeled by such a class can be compressed into a single instance.   The second result shows that due to some subtle measurability issues, in spite of the above mentioned fundamental theorem, there are classes of dimension 1 for which an ERM learning rule fails miserably."}
{"text": "  Methods of transfer learning try to combine knowledge from several related tasks (or domains) to improve performance on a test task. Inspired by causal methodology, we relax the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant over all tasks. We show how this assumption can be motivated from ideas in the field of causality. We focus on the problem of Domain Generalization, in which no examples from the test task are observed. We prove that in an adversarial setting using this subset for prediction is optimal in Domain Generalization; we further provide examples, in which the tasks are sufficiently diverse and the estimator therefore outperforms pooling the data, even on average. If examples from the test task are available, we also provide a method to transfer knowledge from the training tasks and exploit all available features for prediction. However, we provide no guarantees for this method. We introduce a practical method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset and provide corresponding code. We present results on synthetic data sets and a gene deletion data set."}
{"text": "  The characterisation of time-series data via their most salient features is extremely important in a range of machine learning task, not least of all with regards to classification and clustering. While there exist many feature extraction techniques suitable for non-intermittent time-series data, these approaches are not always appropriate for intermittent time-series data, where intermittency is characterized by constant values for large periods of time punctuated by sharp and transient increases or decreases in value.   Motivated by this, we present aggregation, mode decomposition and projection (AMP) a feature extraction technique particularly suited to intermittent time-series data which contain time-frequency patterns. For our method all individual time-series within a set are combined to form a non-intermittent aggregate. This is decomposed into a set of components which represent the intrinsic time-frequency signals within the data set. Individual time-series can then be fit to these components to obtain a set of numerical features that represent their intrinsic time-frequency patterns. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AMP, we evaluate against the real word task of clustering intermittent time-series data. Using synthetically generated data we show that a clustering approach which uses the features derived from AMP significantly outperforms traditional clustering methods. Our technique is further exemplified on a real world data set where AMP can be used to discover groupings of individuals which correspond to real world sub-populations."}
{"text": "  Adaptive Monte Carlo schemes developed over the last years usually seek to ensure ergodicity of the sampling process in line with MCMC tradition. This poses constraints on what is possible in terms of adaptation. In the general case ergodicity can only be guaranteed if adaptation is diminished at a certain rate. Importance Sampling approaches offer a way to circumvent this limitation and design sampling algorithms that keep adapting. Here I present a gradient informed variant of SMC (and its special case Population Monte Carlo) for static problems."}
{"text": "  We consider a task assignment problem in crowdsourcing, which is aimed at collecting as many reliable labels as possible within a limited budget. A challenge in this scenario is how to cope with the diversity of tasks and the task-dependent reliability of workers, e.g., a worker may be good at recognizing the name of sports teams, but not be familiar with cosmetics brands. We refer to this practical setting as heterogeneous crowdsourcing. In this paper, we propose a contextual bandit formulation for task assignment in heterogeneous crowdsourcing, which is able to deal with the exploration-exploitation trade-off in worker selection. We also theoretically investigate the regret bounds for the proposed method, and demonstrate its practical usefulness experimentally."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider a statistical problem of learning a linear model from noisy samples. Existing work has focused on approximating the least squares solution by using leverage-based scores as an importance sampling distribution. However, no finite sample statistical guarantees and no computationally efficient optimal sampling strategies have been proposed. To evaluate the statistical properties of different sampling strategies, we propose a simple yet effective estimator, which is easy for theoretical analysis and is useful in multitask linear regression. We derive the exact mean square error of the proposed estimator for any given sampling scores. Based on minimizing the mean square error, we propose the optimal sampling scores for both estimator and predictor, and show that they are influenced by the noise-to-signal ratio. Numerical simulations match the theoretical analysis well."}
{"text": "  Supervised manifold learning methods learn data representations by preserving the geometric structure of data while enhancing the separation between data samples from different classes. In this work, we propose a theoretical study of supervised manifold learning for classification. We consider nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms that yield linearly separable embeddings of training data and present generalization bounds for this type of algorithms. A necessary condition for satisfactory generalization performance is that the embedding allow the construction of a sufficiently regular interpolation function in relation with the separation margin of the embedding. We show that for supervised embeddings satisfying this condition, the classification error decays at an exponential rate with the number of training samples. Finally, we examine the separability of supervised nonlinear embeddings that aim to preserve the low-dimensional geometric structure of data based on graph representations. The proposed analysis is supported by experiments on several real data sets."}
{"text": "  Capturing the dependence structure of multivariate extreme events is a major concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple sources, e.g. portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management and anomaly detection. One convenient (non-parametric) characterization of extremal dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable 'directions' of extremes, that is, the relative contribution of each feature/coordinate of the 'largest' observations. Modeling the angular measure in high dimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at exhibiting a sparsity pattern within the dependence structure of extremes. This is done by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on representative sets of directions, corresponding to specific sub-cones of $R^d\\_+$. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct application a --first-- anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT. This algorithm builds a sparse 'normal profile' of extreme behaviours, to be confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach."}
{"text": "  Recent decades have seen an interest in prediction problems for which Bayesian methodology has been used ubiquitously. Sampling from or approximating the posterior predictive distribution in a Bayesian model allows one to make inferential statements about potentially observable random quantities given observed data. The purpose of this note is to use statistical decision theory as a basis to justify the use of a posterior predictive distribution for making a point prediction."}
{"text": "  Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent LSTM. The resulting \\textit{Deep Recurrent Q-Network} (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes."}
{"text": "  One of the limiting factors of using support vector machines (SVMs) in large scale applications are their super-linear computational requirements in terms of the number of training samples. To address this issue, several approaches that train SVMs on many small chunks of large data sets separately have been proposed in the literature. So far, however, almost all these approaches have only been empirically investigated. In addition, their motivation was always based on computational requirements. In this work, we consider a localized SVM approach based upon a partition of the input space. For this local SVM, we derive a general oracle inequality. Then we apply this oracle inequality to least squares regression using Gaussian kernels and deduce local learning rates that are essentially minimax optimal under some standard smoothness assumptions on the regression function. This gives the first motivation for using local SVMs that is not based on computational requirements but on theoretical predictions on the generalization performance. We further introduce a data-dependent parameter selection method for our local SVM approach and show that this method achieves the same learning rates as before. Finally, we present some larger scale experiments for our localized SVM showing that it achieves essentially the same test performance as a global SVM for a fraction of the computational requirements. In addition, it turns out that the computational requirements for the local SVMs are similar to those of a vanilla random chunk approach, while the achieved test errors are significantly better."}
{"text": "  Symbolic Data Analysis is based on special descriptions of data - symbolic objects (SO). Such descriptions preserve more detailed information about units and their clusters than the usual representations with mean values. A special kind of symbolic object is a representation with frequency or probability distributions (modal values). This representation enables us to consider in the clustering process the variables of all measurement types at the same time. In the paper a clustering criterion function for SOs is proposed such that the representative of each cluster is again composed of distributions of variables' values over the cluster. The corresponding leaders clustering method is based on this result. It is also shown that for the corresponding agglomerative hierarchical method a generalized Ward's formula holds. Both methods are compatible - they are solving the same clustering optimization problem. The leaders method efficiently solves clustering problems with large number of units; while the agglomerative method can be applied alone on the smaller data set, or it could be applied on leaders, obtained with compatible nonhierarchical clustering method. Such a combination of two compatible methods enables us to decide upon the right number of clusters on the basis of the corresponding dendrogram. The proposed methods were applied on different data sets. In the paper, some results of clustering of ESS data are presented."}
{"text": "  Online decision tree learning algorithms typically examine all features of a new data point to update model parameters. We propose a novel alternative, Reinforcement Learning- based Decision Trees (RLDT), that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to actively examine a minimal number of features of a data point to classify it with high accuracy. Furthermore, RLDT optimizes a long term return, providing a better alternative to the traditional myopic greedy approach to growing decision trees. We demonstrate that this approach performs as well as batch learning algorithms and other online decision tree learning algorithms, while making significantly fewer queries about the features of the data points. We also show that RLDT can effectively handle concept drift."}
{"text": "  In this paper we introduce a novel framework for making exact nonparametric Bayesian inference on latent functions, that is particularly suitable for Big Data tasks. Firstly, we introduce a class of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs), which are not to be mistaken for Gaussian processes operating on text. We construct string GPs so that their finite-dimensional marginals exhibit suitable local conditional independence structures, which allow for scalable, distributed, and flexible nonparametric Bayesian inference, without resorting to approximations, and while ensuring some mild global regularity constraints. Furthermore, string GP priors naturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learned latent function is readily available for explanatory analysis. Secondly, we provide some theoretical results relating our approach to the standard GP paradigm. In particular, we prove that some string GPs are Gaussian processes, which provides a complementary global perspective on our framework. Finally, we derive a scalable and distributed MCMC scheme for supervised learning tasks under string GP priors. The proposed MCMC scheme has computational time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ and memory requirement $\\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $N$ is the data size and $d$ the dimension of the input space. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on several synthetic and real-world datasets, including a dataset with $6$ millions input points and $8$ attributes."}
{"text": "  The amount of data in our society has been exploding in the era of big data today. In this paper, we address several open challenges of big data stream classification, including high volume, high velocity, high dimensionality, high sparsity, and high class-imbalance. Many existing studies in data mining literature solve data stream classification tasks in a batch learning setting, which suffers from poor efficiency and scalability when dealing with big data. To overcome the limitations, this paper investigates an online learning framework for big data stream classification tasks. Unlike some existing online data stream classification techniques that are often based on first-order online learning, we propose a framework of Sparse Online Classification (SOC) for data stream classification, which includes some state-of-the-art first-order sparse online learning algorithms as special cases and allows us to derive a new effective second-order online learning algorithm for data stream classification. In addition, we also propose a new cost-sensitive sparse online learning algorithm by extending the framework with application to tackle online anomaly detection tasks where class distribution of data could be very imbalanced. We also analyze the theoretical bounds of the proposed method, and finally conduct an extensive set of experiments, in which encouraging results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in comparison to a family of state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of data stream classification tasks."}

{"text": "  Task selection (picking an appropriate labeling task) and worker selection (assigning the labeling task to a suitable worker) are two major challenges in task assignment for crowdsourcing. Recently, worker selection has been successfully addressed by the bandit-based task assignment (BBTA) method, while task selection has not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this paper, we experimentally compare several task selection strategies borrowed from active learning literature, and show that the least confidence strategy significantly improves the performance of task assignment in crowdsourcing."}
{"text": "  In this work, we focus on the problem of learning a classification model that performs inference on patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Often, a large amount of costly expert supervision is required to learn such a model. To reduce this cost, we obtain confidence labels that indicate how sure an expert is in the class labels she provides. If meaningful confidence information can be incorporated into a learning method, fewer patient instances may need to be labeled to learn an accurate model. In addition, while accuracy of predictions is important for any inference model, a model of patients must be interpretable so that clinicians can understand how the model is making decisions. To these ends, we develop a novel metric learning method called Confidence bAsed MEtric Learning (CAMEL) that supports inclusion of confidence labels, but also emphasizes interpretability in three ways. First, our method induces sparsity, thus producing simple models that use only a few features from patient EHRs. Second, CAMEL naturally produces confidence scores that can be taken into consideration when clinicians make treatment decisions. Third, the metrics learned by CAMEL induce multidimensional spaces where each dimension represents a different \"factor\" that clinicians can use to assess patients. In our experimental evaluation, we show on a real-world clinical data set that our CAMEL methods are able to learn models that are as or more accurate as other methods that use the same supervision. Furthermore, we show that when CAMEL uses confidence scores it is able to learn models as or more accurate as others we tested while using only 10% of the training instances. Finally, we perform qualitative assessments on the metrics learned by CAMEL and show that they identify and clearly articulate important factors in how the model performs inference."}
{"text": "  The problem of detecting a small number of outliers in a large dataset is an important task in many fields from fraud detection to high-energy physics. Two approaches have emerged to tackle this problem: unsupervised and supervised. Supervised approaches require a sufficient amount of labeled data and are challenged by novel types of outliers and inherent class imbalance, whereas unsupervised methods do not take advantage of available labeled training examples and often exhibit poorer predictive performance. We propose BORE (a Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble) which uses unsupervised outlier scoring functions (OSFs) as features in a supervised learning framework. BORE is able to adapt to arbitrary OSF feature representations, to the imbalance in labeled data as well as to prediction-time constraints on computational cost. We demonstrate the good performance of BORE compared to a variety of competing methods in the non-budgeted and the budgeted outlier detection problem on 12 real-world datasets."}
{"text": "  This work studies the class of algorithms for learning with side-information that emerge by extending generative models with embedded context-related variables. Using finite mixture models (FMM) as the prototypical Bayesian network, we show that maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of parameters through expectation-maximization (EM) improves over the regular unsupervised case and can approach the performances of supervised learning, despite the absence of any explicit ground truth data labeling. By direct application of the missing information principle (MIP), the algorithms' performances are proven to range between the conventional supervised and unsupervised MLE extremities proportionally to the information content of the contextual assistance provided. The acquired benefits regard higher estimation precision, smaller standard errors, faster convergence rates and improved classification accuracy or regression fitness shown in various scenarios, while also highlighting important properties and differences among the outlined situations. Applicability is showcased with three real-world unsupervised classification scenarios employing Gaussian Mixture Models. Importantly, we exemplify the natural extension of this methodology to any type of generative model by deriving an equivalent context-aware algorithm for variational autoencoders (VAs), thus broadening the spectrum of applicability to unsupervised deep learning with artificial neural networks. The latter is contrasted with a neural-symbolic algorithm exploiting side-information."}
{"text": "  T-SNE is a well-known approach to embedding high-dimensional data and has been widely used in data visualization. The basic assumption of t-SNE is that the data are non-constrained in the Euclidean space and the local proximity can be modelled by Gaussian distributions. This assumption does not hold for a wide range of data types in practical applications, for instance spherical data for which the local proximity is better modelled by the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution instead of the Gaussian. This paper presents a vMF-SNE embedding algorithm to embed spherical data. An iterative process is derived to produce an efficient embedding. The results on a simulation data set demonstrated that vMF-SNE produces better embeddings than t-SNE for spherical data."}
{"text": "  Log-density gradient estimation is a fundamental statistical problem and possesses various practical applications such as clustering and measuring non-Gaussianity. A naive two-step approach of first estimating the density and then taking its log-gradient is unreliable because an accurate density estimate does not necessarily lead to an accurate log-density gradient estimate. To cope with this problem, a method to directly estimate the log-density gradient without density estimation has been explored, and demonstrated to work much better than the two-step method. The objective of this paper is to further improve the performance of this direct method in multi-dimensional cases. Our idea is to regard the problem of log-density gradient estimation in each dimension as a task, and apply regularized multi-task learning to the direct log-density gradient estimator. We experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed multi-task method in log-density gradient estimation and mode-seeking clustering."}
{"text": "  Predicting the turnover of a company in the ever fluctuating Stock market has always proved to be a precarious situation and most certainly a difficult task in hand. Data mining is a well-known sphere of Computer Science that aims on extracting meaningful information from large databases. However, despite the existence of many algorithms for the purpose of predicting the future trends, their efficiency is questionable as their predictions suffer from a high error rate. The objective of this paper is to investigate various classification algorithms to predict the turnover of different companies based on the Stock price. The authorized dataset for predicting the turnover was taken from www.bsc.com and included the stock market values of various companies over the past 10 years. The algorithms were investigated using the \"R\" tool. The feature selection algorithm, Boruta, was run on this dataset to extract the important and influential features for classification. With these extracted features, the Total Turnover of the company was predicted using various classification algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM and Multinomial Regression. This prediction mechanism was implemented to predict the turnover of a company on an everyday basis and hence could help navigate through dubious stock market trades. An accuracy rate of 95% was achieved by the above prediction process. Moreover, the importance of stock market attributes was established as well."}
{"text": "  Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures and critical infrastructures against common threats and illegal activities. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis framework to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. The proposed framework views vessel behavior as probabilistic processes and uses machine learning to model common vessel interaction patterns. We represent patterns of interest as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify such patterns using Support Vector Machines."}
{"text": "  Determinantal point processes (DPPs) offer an elegant tool for encoding probabilities over subsets of a ground set. Discrete DPPs are parametrized by a positive semidefinite matrix (called the DPP kernel), and estimating this kernel is key to learning DPPs from observed data. We consider the task of learning the DPP kernel, and develop for it a surprisingly simple yet effective new algorithm. Our algorithm offers the following benefits over previous approaches: (a) it is much simpler; (b) it yields equally good and sometimes even better local maxima; and (c) it runs an order of magnitude faster on large problems. We present experimental results on both real and simulated data to illustrate the numerical performance of our technique."}
{"text": "  A typical goal of supervised dimension reduction is to find a low-dimensional subspace of the input space such that the projected input variables preserve maximal information about the output variables. The dependence maximization approach solves the supervised dimension reduction problem through maximizing a statistical dependence between projected input variables and output variables. A well-known statistical dependence measure is mutual information (MI) which is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, it is known that the KL divergence is sensitive to outliers. On the other hand, quadratic MI (QMI) is a variant of MI based on the $L_2$ distance which is more robust against outliers than the KL divergence, and a computationally efficient method to estimate QMI from data, called least-squares QMI (LSQMI), has been proposed recently. For these reasons, developing a supervised dimension reduction method based on LSQMI seems promising. However, not QMI itself, but the derivative of QMI is needed for subspace search in supervised dimension reduction, and the derivative of an accurate QMI estimator is not necessarily a good estimator of the derivative of QMI. In this paper, we propose to directly estimate the derivative of QMI without estimating QMI itself. We show that the direct estimation of the derivative of QMI is more accurate than the derivative of the estimated QMI. Finally, we develop a supervised dimension reduction algorithm which efficiently uses the proposed derivative estimator, and demonstrate through experiments that the proposed method is more robust against outliers than existing methods."}
{"text": "  We study statistical calibration, i.e., adjusting features of a computational model that are not observable or controllable in its associated physical system. We focus on functional calibration, which arises in many manufacturing processes where the unobservable features, called calibration variables, are a function of the input variables. A major challenge in many applications is that computational models are expensive and can only be evaluated a limited number of times. Furthermore, without making strong assumptions, the calibration variables are not identifiable. We propose Bayesian non-isometric matching calibration (BNMC) that allows calibration of expensive computational models with only a limited number of samples taken from a computational model and its associated physical system. BNMC replaces the computational model with a dynamic Gaussian process (GP) whose parameters are trained in the calibration procedure. To resolve the identifiability issue, we present the calibration problem from a geometric perspective of non-isometric curve to surface matching, which enables us to take advantage of combinatorial optimization techniques to extract necessary information for constructing prior distributions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that in terms of prediction accuracy BNMC outperforms, or is comparable to, other existing calibration frameworks."}
{"text": "  We study large-scale spatial systems that contain exogenous variables, e.g. environmental factors that are significant predictors in spatial processes. Building predictive models for such processes is challenging because the large numbers of observations present makes it inefficient to apply full Kriging. In order to reduce computational complexity, this paper proposes Sparse Pseudo-input Local Kriging (SPLK), which utilizes hyperplanes to partition a domain into smaller subdomains and then applies a sparse approximation of the full Kriging to each subdomain. We also develop an optimization procedure to find the desired hyperplanes. To alleviate the problem of discontinuity in the global predictor, we impose continuity constraints on the boundaries of the neighboring subdomains. Furthermore, partitioning the domain into smaller subdomains makes it possible to use different parameter values for the covariance function in each region and, therefore, the heterogeneity in the data structure can be effectively captured. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SPLK outperforms, or is comparable to, the algorithms commonly applied to spatial datasets."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of structure learning for bow-free acyclic path diagrams (BAPs). BAPs can be viewed as a generalization of linear Gaussian DAG models that allow for certain hidden variables. We present a first method for this problem using a greedy score-based search algorithm. We also prove some necessary and some sufficient conditions for distributional equivalence of BAPs which are used in an algorithmic ap- proach to compute (nearly) equivalent model structures. This allows us to infer lower bounds of causal effects. We also present applications to real and simulated datasets using our publicly available R-package."}
{"text": "  Dropout and other feature noising schemes have shown promising results in controlling over-fitting by artificially corrupting the training data. Though extensive theoretical and empirical studies have been performed for generalized linear models, little work has been done for support vector machines (SVMs), one of the most successful approaches for supervised learning. This paper presents dropout training for both linear SVMs and the nonlinear extension with latent representation learning. For linear SVMs, to deal with the intractable expectation of the non-smooth hinge loss under corrupting distributions, we develop an iteratively re-weighted least square (IRLS) algorithm by exploring data augmentation techniques. Our algorithm iteratively minimizes the expectation of a re-weighted least square problem, where the re-weights are analytically updated. For nonlinear latent SVMs, we consider learning one layer of latent representations in SVMs and extend the data augmentation technique in conjunction with first-order Taylor-expansion to deal with the intractable expected non-smooth hinge loss and the nonlinearity of latent representations. Finally, we apply the similar data augmentation ideas to develop a new IRLS algorithm for the expected logistic loss under corrupting distributions, and we further develop a non-linear extension of logistic regression by incorporating one layer of latent representations. Our algorithms offer insights on the connection and difference between the hinge loss and logistic loss in dropout training. Empirical results on several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of dropout training on significantly boosting the classification accuracy of both linear and nonlinear SVMs. In addition, the nonlinear SVMs further improve the prediction performance on several image datasets."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel parameter estimation procedure that works efficiently for conditional random fields (CRF). This algorithm is an extension to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), using loss functions defined by Bregman divergences which measure the proximity between the model expectation and the empirical mean of the feature vectors. This leads to a flexible training framework from which multiple update strategies can be derived using natural gradient descent (NGD). We carefully choose the convex function inducing the Bregman divergence so that the types of updates are reduced, while making the optimization procedure more effective by transforming the gradients of the log-likelihood loss function. The derived algorithms are very simple and can be easily implemented on top of the existing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization procedure, yet it is very effective as illustrated by experimental results."}
{"text": "  We present improved methods of using structured SVMs in a large-scale hierarchical classification problem, that is when labels are leaves, or sets of leaves, in a tree or a DAG. We examine the need to normalize both the regularization and the margin and show how doing so significantly improves performance, including allowing achieving state-of-the-art results where unnormalized structured SVMs do not perform better than flat models. We also describe a further extension of hierarchical SVMs that highlight the connection between hierarchical SVMs and matrix factorization models."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of minimizing a sum of $n$ functions over a convex parameter set $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^p$ where $n\\gg p\\gg 1$. In this regime, algorithms which utilize sub-sampling techniques are known to be effective. In this paper, we use sub-sampling techniques together with low-rank approximation to design a new randomized batch algorithm which possesses comparable convergence rate to Newton's method, yet has much smaller per-iteration cost. The proposed algorithm is robust in terms of starting point and step size, and enjoys a composite convergence rate, namely, quadratic convergence at start and linear convergence when the iterate is close to the minimizer. We develop its theoretical analysis which also allows us to select near-optimal algorithm parameters. Our theoretical results can be used to obtain convergence rates of previously proposed sub-sampling based algorithms as well. We demonstrate how our results apply to well-known machine learning problems. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several datasets under various scenarios."}
{"text": "  Dropout has recently emerged as a powerful and simple method for training neural networks preventing co-adaptation by stochastically omitting neurons. Dropout is currently not grounded in explicit modelling assumptions which so far has precluded its adoption in Bayesian modelling. Using Bayesian entropic reasoning we show that dropout can be interpreted as optimal inference under constraints. We demonstrate this on an analytically tractable regression model providing a Bayesian interpretation of its mechanism for regularizing and preventing co-adaptation as well as its connection to other Bayesian techniques. We also discuss two general approximate techniques for applying Bayesian dropout for general models, one based on an analytical approximation and the other on stochastic variational techniques. These techniques are then applied to a Baysian logistic regression problem and are shown to improve performance as the model become more misspecified. Our framework roots dropout as a theoretically justified and practical tool for statistical modelling allowing Bayesians to tap into the benefits of dropout training."}
{"text": "  Cutting-plane methods are well-studied localization(and optimization) algorithms. We show that they provide a natural framework to perform machinelearning ---and not just to solve optimization problems posed by machinelearning--- in addition to their intended optimization use. In particular, theyallow one to learn sparse classifiers and provide good compression schemes.Moreover, we show that very little effort is required to turn them intoeffective active learning methods. This last property provides a generic way todesign a whole family of active learning algorithms from existing passivemethods. We present numerical simulations testifying of the relevance ofcutting-plane methods for passive and active learning tasks."}
{"text": "  Most existing binary classification methods target on the optimization of the overall classification risk and may fail to serve some real-world applications such as cancer diagnosis, where users are more concerned with the risk of misclassifying one specific class than the other. Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm was introduced in this context as a novel statistical framework for handling asymmetric type I/II error priorities. It seeks classifiers with a minimal type II error and a constrained type I error under a user specified level. This article is the first attempt to construct classifiers with guaranteed theoretical performance under the NP paradigm in high-dimensional settings. Based on the fundamental Neyman-Pearson Lemma, we used a plug-in approach to construct NP-type classifiers for Naive Bayes models. The proposed classifiers satisfy the NP oracle inequalities, which are natural NP paradigm counterparts of the oracle inequalities in classical binary classification. Besides their desirable theoretical properties, we also demonstrated their numerical advantages in prioritized error control via both simulation and real data studies."}
{"text": "  Research in transportation frequently involve modelling and predicting attributes of events that occur at regular intervals. The event could be arrival of a bus at a bus stop, the volume of a traffic at a particular point, the demand at a particular bus stop etc. In this work, we propose a specific implementation of probabilistic graphical models to learn the probabilistic dependency between the events that occur in a network. A dependency graph is built from the past observed instances of the event and we use the graph to understand the causal effects of some events on others in the system. The dependency graph is also used to predict the attributes of future events and is shown to have a good prediction accuracy compared to the state of the art."}
{"text": "  In this paper we introduce a novel hash learning framework that has two main distinguishing features, when compared to past approaches. First, it utilizes codewords in the Hamming space as ancillary means to accomplish its hash learning task. These codewords, which are inferred from the data, attempt to capture similarity aspects of the data's hash codes. Secondly and more importantly, the same framework is capable of addressing supervised, unsupervised and, even, semi-supervised hash learning tasks in a natural manner. A series of comparative experiments focused on content-based image retrieval highlights its performance advantages."}

{"text": "  When faced with learning a set of inter-related tasks from a limited amount of usable data, learning each task independently may lead to poor generalization performance. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) exploits the latent relations between tasks and overcomes data scarcity limitations by co-learning all these tasks simultaneously to offer improved performance. We propose a novel Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning framework based on Support Vector Machines for binary classification tasks. By considering pair-wise task affinity in terms of similarity between a pair's respective feature spaces, the new framework, compared to other similar MTL approaches, offers a high degree of flexibility in determining how similar feature spaces should be, as well as which pairs of tasks should share a common feature space in order to benefit overall performance. The associated optimization problem is solved via a block coordinate descent, which employs a consensus-form Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithm to optimize the Multiple Kernel Learning weights and, hence, to determine task affinities. Empirical evaluation on seven data sets exhibits a statistically significant improvement of our framework's results compared to the ones of several other Clustered Multi-Task Learning methods."}
{"text": "  We develop a fully discriminative learning approach for supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using Back Propagation (i.e., BP-sLDA), which maximizes the posterior probability of the prediction variable given the input document. Different from traditional variational learning or Gibbs sampling approaches, the proposed learning method applies (i) the mirror descent algorithm for maximum a posterior inference and (ii) back propagation over a deep architecture together with stochastic gradient/mirror descent for model parameter estimation, leading to scalable and end-to-end discriminative learning of the model. As a byproduct, we also apply this technique to develop a new learning method for the traditional unsupervised LDA model (i.e., BP-LDA). Experimental results on three real-world regression and classification tasks show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the previous supervised topic models, neural networks, and is on par with deep neural networks."}
{"text": "  Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a popular and efficient tool for global optimization and hyperparameter tuning. Currently, the established Bayesian optimization practice requires a user-defined bounding box which is assumed to contain the optimizer. However, when little is known about the probed objective function, it can be difficult to prescribe such bounds. In this work we modify the standard Bayesian optimization framework in a principled way to allow automatic resizing of the search space. We introduce two alternative methods and compare them on two common synthetic benchmarking test functions as well as the tasks of tuning the stochastic gradient descent optimizer of a multi-layered perceptron and a convolutional neural network on MNIST."}
{"text": "  To increase efficacy in traditional classroom courses as well as in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), automated systems supporting the instructor are needed. One important problem is to automatically detect students that are going to do poorly in a course early enough to be able to take remedial actions. Existing grade prediction systems focus on maximizing the accuracy of the prediction while overseeing the importance of issuing timely and personalized predictions. This paper proposes an algorithm that predicts the final grade of each student in a class. It issues a prediction for each student individually, when the expected accuracy of the prediction is sufficient. The algorithm learns online what is the optimal prediction and time to issue a prediction based on past history of students' performance in a course. We derive a confidence estimate for the prediction accuracy and demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a dataset obtained based on the performance of approximately 700 UCLA undergraduate students who have taken an introductory digital signal processing over the past 7 years. We demonstrate that for 85% of the students we can predict with 76% accuracy whether they are going do well or poorly in the class after the 4th course week. Using data obtained from a pilot course, our methodology suggests that it is effective to perform early in-class assessments such as quizzes, which result in timely performance prediction for each student, thereby enabling timely interventions by the instructor (at the student or class level) when necessary."}
{"text": "  We present a novel approach for fully non-stationary Gaussian process regression (GPR), where all three key parameters -- noise variance, signal variance and lengthscale -- can be simultaneously input-dependent. We develop gradient-based inference methods to learn the unknown function and the non-stationary model parameters, without requiring any model approximations. We propose to infer full parameter posterior with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which conveniently extends the analytical gradient-based GPR learning by guiding the sampling with model gradients. We also learn the MAP solution from the posterior by gradient ascent. In experiments on several synthetic datasets and in modelling of temporal gene expression, the nonstationary GPR is shown to be necessary for modeling realistic input-dependent dynamics, while it performs comparably to conventional stationary or previous non-stationary GPR models otherwise."}
{"text": "  Recently ensemble selection for consensus clustering has emerged as a research problem in Machine Intelligence. Normally consensus clustering algorithms take into account the entire ensemble of clustering, where there is a tendency of generating a very large size ensemble before computing its consensus. One can avoid considering the entire ensemble and can judiciously select few partitions in the ensemble without compromising on the quality of the consensus. This may result in an efficient consensus computation technique and may save unnecessary computational overheads. The ensemble selection problem addresses this issue of consensus clustering. In this paper, we propose an efficient method of ensemble selection for a large ensemble. We prioritize the partitions in the ensemble based on diversity and frequency. Our method selects top K of the partitions in order of priority, where K is decided by the user. We observe that considering jointly the diversity and frequency helps in identifying few representative partitions whose consensus is qualitatively better than the consensus of the entire ensemble. Experimental analysis on a large number of datasets shows our method gives better results than earlier ensemble selection methods."}
{"text": "  We are interested in solving the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem for instances, where the underlying sparsity pattern exhibit spatio-temporal structure motivated by the electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization problem. We propose a probabilistic model that takes this structure into account by generalizing the structured spike and slab prior and the associated Expectation Propagation inference scheme. Based on numerical experiments, we demonstrate the viability of the model and the approximate inference scheme."}
{"text": "  We consider how to learn multi-step predictions efficiently. Conventional algorithms wait until observing actual outcomes before performing the computations to update their predictions. If predictions are made at a high rate or span over a large amount of time, substantial computation can be required to store all relevant observations and to update all predictions when the outcome is finally observed. We show that the exact same predictions can be learned in a much more computationally congenial way, with uniform per-step computation that does not depend on the span of the predictions. We apply this idea to various settings of increasing generality, repeatedly adding desired properties and each time deriving an equivalent span-independent algorithm for the conventional algorithm that satisfies these desiderata. Interestingly, along the way several known algorithmic constructs emerge spontaneously from our derivations, including dutch eligibility traces, temporal difference errors, and averaging. This allows us to link these constructs one-to-one to the corresponding desiderata, unambiguously connecting the `how' to the `why'. Each step, we make sure that the derived algorithm subsumes the previous algorithms, thereby retaining their properties. Ultimately we arrive at a single general temporal-difference algorithm that is applicable to the full setting of reinforcement learning."}
{"text": "  Gear drives are one of the most widely used transmission system in many machinery. Sound signals of a rotating machine contain the dynamic information about its health conditions. Not much information available in the literature reporting suitability of sound signals for fault diagnosis applications. Maximum numbers of literature are based on FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis and have its own limitations with non-stationary signals like the ones from gears. In this paper, attempt has been made in using sound signals acquired from gears in good and simulated faulty conditions for the purpose of fault diagnosis through a machine learning approach. The descriptive statistical features were extracted from the acquired sound signals and the predominant features were selected using J48 decision tree technique. The selected features were then used for classification using Large Margin K-nearest neighbor approach. The paper also discusses the effect of various parameters on classification accuracy."}

Both optimization and linear algebra methods can be used for efficientcomputation of the classification functions. We demonstrate on numerical examples that theRegularized Laplacian method is competitive with respect to the other state of the art semi-supervisedlearning methods."}
{"text": "  Distance weighted discrimination (DWD) is a margin-based classifier with an interesting geometric motivation. DWD was originally proposed as a superior alternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be popular compared with the SVM. The main reasons are twofold. First, the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone programming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is much more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD mainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting and data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency of DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work, we advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and theoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving DWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing state-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can handle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a special DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural kernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel DWD. We compare DWD and the SVM on several benchmark data sets and show that the two have comparable classification accuracy, but DWD equipped with our new algorithm can be much faster to compute than the SVM."}
{"text": "  Several sparsity-constrained algorithms such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit or the Frank-Wolfe algorithm with sparsity constraints work by iteratively selecting a novel atom to add to the current non-zero set of variables. This selection step is usually performed by computing the gradient and then by looking for the gradient component with maximal absolute entry. This step can be computationally expensive especially for large-scale and high-dimensional data. In this work, we aim at accelerating these sparsity-constrained optimization algorithms by exploiting the key observation that, for these algorithms to work, one only needs the coordinate of the gradient's top entry. Hence, we introduce algorithms based on greedy methods and randomization approaches that aim at cheaply estimating the gradient and its top entry. Another of our contribution is to cast the problem of finding the best gradient entry as a best arm identification in a multi-armed bandit problem. Owing to this novel insight, we are able to provide a bandit-based algorithm that directly estimates the top entry in a very efficient way. Theoretical observations stating that the resulting inexact Frank-Wolfe or Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithms act, with high probability, similarly to their exact versions are also given. We have carried out several experiments showing that the greedy deterministic and the bandit approaches we propose can achieve an acceleration of an order of magnitude while being as efficient as the exact gradient when used in algorithms such as OMP, Frank-Wolfe or CoSaMP."}
{"text": "  Anomaly detection is an important task in many real world applications such as fraud detection, suspicious activity detection, health care monitoring etc. In this paper, we tackle this problem from supervised learning perspective in online learning setting. We maximize well known \\emph{Gmean} metric for class-imbalance learning in online learning framework. Specifically, we show that maximizing \\emph{Gmean} is equivalent to minimizing a convex surrogate loss function and based on that we propose novel online learning algorithm for anomaly detection. We then show, by extensive experiments, that the performance of the proposed algorithm with respect to $sum$ metric is as good as a recently proposed Cost-Sensitive Online Classification(CSOC) algorithm for class-imbalance learning over various benchmarked data sets while keeping running time close to the perception algorithm. Our another conclusion is that other competitive online algorithms do not perform consistently over data sets of varying size. This shows the potential applicability of our proposed approach."}
{"text": "  We consider a variant of the multi-armed bandit model, which we call multi-armed bandit problem with known trend, where the gambler knows the shape of the reward function of each arm but not its distribution. This new problem is motivated by different online problems like active learning, music and interface recommendation applications, where when an arm is sampled by the model the received reward change according to a known trend. By adapting the standard multi-armed bandit algorithm UCB1 to take advantage of this setting, we propose the new algorithm named A-UCB that assumes a stochastic model. We provide upper bounds of the regret which compare favourably with the ones of UCB1. We also confirm that experimentally with different simulations"}
{"text": "  The paper has been withdrawn since more effective experiments should be completed.   Auto-encoders (AE) has been widely applied in different fields of machine learning. However, as a deep model, there are a large amount of learnable parameters in the AE, which would cause over-fitting and slow learning speed in practice. Many researchers have been study the intrinsic structure of AE and showed different useful methods to regularize those parameters. In this paper, we present a novel regularization method based on a clustering algorithm which is able to classify the parameters into different groups. With this regularization, parameters in a given group have approximate equivalent values and over-fitting problem could be alleviated. Moreover, due to the competitive behavior of clustering algorithm, this model also overcomes some intrinsic problems of clustering algorithms like the determination of number of clusters. Experiments on handwritten digits recognition verify the effectiveness of our novel model."}
{"text": "  A general approach for anomaly detection or novelty detection consists in estimating high density regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates. Results on actual data sets are also presented."}
{"text": "  With the rapid growth in multimedia services and the enormous offers of video contents in online social networks, users have difficulty in obtaining their interests. Therefore, various personalized recommendation systems have been proposed. However, they ignore that the accelerated proliferation of social media data has led to the big data era, which has greatly impeded the process of video recommendation. In addition, none of them has considered both the privacy of users' contexts (e,g., social status, ages and hobbies) and video service vendors' repositories, which are extremely sensitive and of significant commercial value. To handle the problems, we propose a cloud-assisted differentially private video recommendation system based on distributed online learning. In our framework, service vendors are modeled as distributed cooperative learners, recommending videos according to user's context, while simultaneously adapting the video-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks (reward). Considering the sparsity and heterogeneity of big social media data, we also propose a novel geometric differentially private model, which can greatly reduce the performance (recommendation accuracy) loss. Our simulation shows the proposed algorithms outperform other existing methods and keep a delicate balance between computing accuracy and privacy preserving level."}
{"text": "  Many sensors/meters are deployed in commercial buildings to monitor and optimize their performance. However, because sensor metadata is inconsistent across buildings, software-based solutions are tightly coupled to the sensor metadata conventions (i.e. schemas and naming) for each building. Running the same software across buildings requires significant integration effort.   Metadata normalization is critical for scaling the deployment process and allows us to decouple building-specific conventions from the code written for building applications. It also allows us to deal with missing metadata. One important aspect of normalization is to differentiate sensors by the typeof phenomena being observed. In this paper, we propose a general, simple, yet effective classification scheme to differentiate sensors in buildings by type. We perform ensemble learning on data collected from over 2000 sensor streams in two buildings. Our approach is able to achieve more than 92% accuracy for classification within buildings and more than 82% accuracy for across buildings. We also introduce a method for identifying potential misclassified streams. This is important because it allows us to identify opportunities to attain more input from experts -- input that could help improve classification accuracy when ground truth is unavailable. We show that by adjusting a threshold value we are able to identify at least 30% of the misclassified instances."}

Here, we introduce a Perpetual Learning Machine; a new type of DNN that is capable of brain-like dynamic 'on the fly' learning because it exists in a self-supervised state of Perpetual Stochastic Gradient Descent. Thus, we provide the means to unify learning and memory within a machine learning framework. We also explore the elegant duality of abstraction and synthesis: the Yin and Yang of deep learning."}
{"text": "  We propose an alternative method for training a classification model. Using the MNIST set of handwritten digits and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, it is possible to reach a classification performance competitive to semi-supervised learning if we first train a model in an unsupervised fashion on unlabeled data only, and then manually add labels to model samples instead of training data samples with the help of a GUI. This approach can benefit from the fact that model samples can be presented to the human labeler in a video-like fashion, resulting in a higher number of labeled examples. Also, after some initial training, hard-to-classify examples can be distinguished from easy ones automatically, saving manual work."}
{"text": "  The availability of graph data with node attributes that can be either discrete or real-valued is constantly increasing. While existing kernel methods are effective techniques for dealing with graphs having discrete node labels, their adaptation to non-discrete or continuous node attributes has been limited, mainly for computational issues. Recently, a few kernels especially tailored for this domain, and that trade predictive performance for computational efficiency, have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a graph kernel for complex and continuous nodes' attributes, whose features are tree structures extracted from specific graph visits. The kernel manages to keep the same complexity of state-of-the-art kernels while implicitly using a larger feature space. We further present an approximated variant of the kernel which reduces its complexity significantly. Experimental results obtained on six real-world datasets show that the kernel is the best performing one on most of them. Moreover, in most cases the approximated version reaches comparable performances to current state-of-the-art kernels in terms of classification accuracy while greatly shortening the running times."}
{"text": "  One of the challenging problems in biology is to classify plants based on their reaction on genetic mutation. Arabidopsis Thaliana is a plant that is so interesting, because its genetic structure has some similarities with that of human beings. Biologists classify the type of this plant to mutated and not mutated (wild) types. Phenotypic analysis of these types is a time-consuming and costly effort by individuals. In this paper, we propose a modified feature extraction step by using velocity and acceleration of root growth. In the second step, for plant classification, we employed different Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels and two hybrid systems of neural networks. Gated Negative Correlation Learning (GNCL) and Mixture of Negatively Correlated Experts (MNCE) are two ensemble methods based on complementary feature of classical classifiers; Mixture of Expert (ME) and Negative Correlation Learning (NCL). The hybrid systems conserve of advantages and decrease the effects of disadvantages of NCL and ME. Our Experimental shows that MNCE and GNCL improve the efficiency of classical classifiers, however, some SVM kernels function has better performance than classifiers based on neural network ensemble method. Moreover, kernels consume less time to obtain a classification rate."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose another version of help-training approach by employing a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) that improves the performance of the main discriminative classifier in the semi-supervised strategy. We introduce the PNN-training algorithm and use it for training the support vector machine (SVM) with a few numbers of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data. We try to find the best labels for unlabeled data and then use SVM to enhance the classification rate. We test our method on two famous benchmarks and show the efficiency of our method in comparison with pervious methods."}
{"text": "  Deep learning has demonstrated the power of detailed modeling of complex high-order (multivariate) interactions in data. For some learning tasks there is power in learning models that are not only Deep but also Broad. By Broad, we mean models that incorporate evidence from large numbers of features. This is of especial value in applications where many different features and combinations of features all carry small amounts of information about the class. The most accurate models will integrate all that information. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for Deep Broad Learning called DBL. The proposed algorithm has a tunable parameter $n$, that specifies the depth of the model. It provides straightforward paths towards out-of-core learning for large data. We demonstrate that DBL learns models from large quantities of data with accuracy that is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "  Two approaches for graph based semi-supervised learning are proposed. The firstapproach is based on iteration of an affine map. A key element of the affine map iteration is sparsematrix-vector multiplication, which has several very efficient parallel implementations. The secondapproach belongs to the class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. It is based onsampling of nodes by performing a random walk on the graph. The latter approach is distributedby its nature and can be easily implemented on several processors or over the network. Boththeoretical and practical evaluations are provided. It is found that the nodes are classified intotheir class with very small error. The sampling algorithm's ability to track new incoming nodesand to classify them is also demonstrated."}
{"text": "  Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of repulsion and diversity over discrete sets of items. But their applicability to large sets is hindered by expensive cubic-complexity matrix operations for basic tasks such as sampling. In light of this, we propose a new method for approximate sampling from discrete $k$-DPPs. Our method takes advantage of the diversity property of subsets sampled from a DPP, and proceeds in two stages: first it constructs coresets for the ground set of items; thereafter, it efficiently samples subsets based on the constructed coresets. As opposed to previous approaches, our algorithm aims to minimize the total variation distance to the original distribution. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that our sampling algorithm works efficiently on large data sets, and yields more accurate samples than previous approaches."}
{"text": "  While stochastic variational inference is relatively well known for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models, related methods also offer ways to circumnavigate the approximation of analytically intractable expectations. The key challenge in either setting is controlling the variance of gradient estimates: recent work has shown that for continuous latent variables, particularly multivariate Gaussians, this can be achieved by using the gradient of the log posterior. In this paper we apply the same idea to gamma distributed latent variables given gamma variational distributions, enabling straightforward \"black box\" variational inference in models where sparsity and non-negativity are appropriate. We demonstrate the method on a recently proposed gamma process model for network data, as well as a novel sparse factor analysis. We outperform generic sampling algorithms and the approach of using Gaussian variational distributions on transformed variables."}
{"text": "  The downfall of many supervised learning algorithms, such as neural networks, is the inherent need for a large amount of training data. Although there is a lot of buzz about big data, there is still the problem of doing classification from a small dataset. Other methods such as support vector machines, although capable of dealing with few samples, are inherently binary classifiers, and are in need of learning strategies such as One vs All in the case of multi-classification. In the presence of a large number of classes this can become problematic. In this paper we present, a novel approach to supervised learning through the method of clustering. Unlike traditional methods such as K-Means, Gravitational Clustering does not require the initial number of clusters, and automatically builds the clusters, individual samples can be arbitrarily weighted and it requires only few samples while staying resilient to over-fitting."}
{"text": "  Domain adaptation problems arise in a variety of applications, where a training dataset from the \\textit{source} domain and a test dataset from the \\textit{target} domain typically follow different distributions. The primary difficulty in designing effective learning models to solve such problems lies in how to bridge the gap between the source and target distributions. In this paper, we provide comprehensive analysis of feature learning algorithms used in conjunction with linear classifiers for domain adaptation. Our analysis shows that in order to achieve good adaptation performance, the second moments of the source domain distribution and target domain distribution should be similar. Based on our new analysis, a novel extremely easy feature learning algorithm for domain adaptation is proposed. Furthermore, our algorithm is extended by leveraging multiple layers, leading to a deep linear model. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of domain adaptation tasks on the Amazon review dataset and the spam dataset from the ECML/PKDD 2006 discovery challenge."}
{"text": "  This text investigates relations between two well-known family of algorithms, matrix factorisations and recursive linear filters, by describing a probabilistic model in which approximate inference corresponds to a matrix factorisation algorithm. Using the probabilistic model, we derive a matrix factorisation algorithm as a recursive linear filter. More precisely, we derive a matrix-variate recursive linear filter in order to perform efficient inference in high dimensions. We also show that it is possible to interpret our algorithm as a nontrivial stochastic gradient algorithm. Demonstrations and comparisons on an image restoration task are given."}
{"text": "  Large sample size brings the computation bottleneck for modern data analysis. Subsampling is one of efficient strategies to handle this problem. In previous studies, researchers make more fo- cus on subsampling with replacement (SSR) than on subsampling without replacement (SSWR). In this paper we investigate a kind of SSWR, poisson subsampling (PSS), for fast algorithm in ordinary least-square problem. We establish non-asymptotic property, i.e, the error bound of the correspond- ing subsample estimator, which provide a tradeoff between computation cost and approximation efficiency. Besides the non-asymptotic result, we provide asymptotic consistency and normality of the subsample estimator. Methodologically, we propose a two-step subsampling algorithm, which is efficient with respect to a statistical objective and independent on the linear model assumption.. Synthetic and real data are used to empirically study our proposed subsampling strategies. We argue by these empirical studies that, (1) our proposed two-step algorithm has obvious advantage when the assumed linear model does not accurate, and (2) the PSS strategy performs obviously better than SSR when the subsampling ratio increases."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we focus on the stochastic block model (SBM),a probabilistic tool describing interactions between nodes of a network using latent clusters. The SBM assumes that the networkhas a stationary structure, in which connections of time varying intensity are not taken into account. In other words, interactions between two groups are forced to have the same features during the whole observation time. To overcome this limitation,we propose a partition of the whole time horizon, in which interactions are observed, and develop a non stationary extension of the SBM,allowing to simultaneously cluster the nodes in a network along with fixed time intervals in which the interactions take place. The number of clusters (K for nodes, D for time intervals) as well as the class memberships are finallyobtained through maximizing the complete-data integrated likelihood by means of a greedy search approach. After showing that the model works properly with simulated data, we focus on a real data set. We thus consider the three days ACM Hypertext conference held in Turin,June 29th - July 1st 2009. Proximity interactions between attendees during the first day are modelled and an interestingclustering of the daily hours is finally obtained, with times of social gathering (e.g. coffee breaks) recovered by the approach. Applications to large networks are limited due to the computational complexity of the greedy search which is dominated bythe number $K\\_{max}$ and $D\\_{max}$ of clusters used in the initialization. Therefore,advanced clustering tools are considered to reduce the number of clusters expected in the data, making the greedy search applicable to large networks."}
{"text": "  We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We show that finding the best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression. We also show that, under some asumptions, universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization remains possible using the MAPE."}
{"text": "  Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is a class of online margin-based algorithms suitable for a wide range of real-time prediction tasks, including classification and regression. PA algorithms are formulated in terms of deterministic point-estimation problems governed by a set of user-defined hyperparameters: the approach fails to capture model/prediction uncertainty and makes their performance highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. In this paper, we introduce a novel PA learning framework for regression that overcomes the above limitations. We contribute a Bayesian state-space interpretation of PA regression, along with a novel online variational inference scheme, that not only produces probabilistic predictions, but also offers the benefit of automatic hyperparameter tuning. Experiments with various real-world data sets show that our approach performs significantly better than a more standard, linear Gaussian state-space model."}
{"text": "  We propose a second-order (Hessian or Hessian-free) based optimization method for variational inference inspired by Gaussian backpropagation, and argue that quasi-Newton optimization can be developed as well. This is accomplished by generalizing the gradient computation in stochastic backpropagation via a reparametrization trick with lower complexity. As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to the problems of Bayesian logistic regression and variational auto-encoder (VAE). Additionally, we compute bounds on the estimator variance of intractable expectations for the family of Lipschitz continuous function. Our method is practical, scalable and model free. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets and provide comparisons with other stochastic gradient methods to show substantial enhancement in convergence rates."}
{"text": "  In this study, we propose an automatic learning method for variables selection based on Lasso in epidemiology context. One of the aim of this approach is to overcome the pretreatment of experts in medicine and epidemiology on collected data. These pretreatment consist in recoding some variables and to choose some interactions based on expertise. The approach proposed uses all available explanatory variables without treatment and generate automatically all interactions between them. This lead to high dimension. We use Lasso, one of the robust methods of variable selection in high dimension. To avoid over fitting a two levels cross-validation is used. Because the target variable is account variable and the lasso estimators are biased, variables selected by lasso are debiased by a GLM and used to predict the distribution of the main vector of malaria which is Anopheles. Results show that only few climatic and environmental variables are the mains factors associated to the malaria risk exposure."}
{"text": "  In a recent article we described a new type of deep neural network - a Perpetual Learning Machine (PLM) - which is capable of learning 'on the fly' like a brain by existing in a state of Perpetual Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD). Here, by simulating the process of practice, we demonstrate both selective memory and selective forgetting when we introduce statistical recall biases during PSGD. Frequently recalled memories are remembered, whilst memories recalled rarely are forgotten. This results in a 'use it or lose it' stimulus driven memory process that is similar to human memory."}
{"text": "  Cluster analysis is one of the primary data analysis technique in data mining and K-means is one of the commonly used partitioning clustering algorithm. In K-means algorithm, resulting set of clusters depend on the choice of initial centroids. If we can find initial centroids which are coherent with the arrangement of data, the better set of clusters can be obtained. This paper proposes a method based on the Dissimilarity Tree to find, the better initial centroid as well as every bit more accurate cluster with less computational time. Theory analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of clusters and reduce the computational complexity of the K-means algorithm."}
{"text": "  Using a proper model to characterize a time series is crucial in making accurate predictions. In this work we use time-varying autoregressive process (TVAR) to describe non-stationary time series and model it as a mixture of multiple stable autoregressive (AR) processes. We introduce a new model selection technique based on Gap statistics to learn the appropriate number of AR filters needed to model a time series. We define a new distance measure between stable AR filters and draw a reference curve that is used to measure how much adding a new AR filter improves the performance of the model, and then choose the number of AR filters that has the maximum gap with the reference curve. To that end, we propose a new method in order to generate uniform random stable AR filters in root domain. Numerical results are provided demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Feature weighting algorithms try to solve a problem of great importance nowadays in machine learning: The search of a relevance measure for the features of a given domain. This relevance is primarily used for feature selection as feature weighting can be seen as a generalization of it, but it is also useful to better understand a problem's domain or to guide an inductor in its learning process. Relief family of algorithms are proven to be very effective in this task. Some other feature weighting methods are reviewed in order to give some context and then the different existing extensions to the original algorithm are explained.   One of Relief's known issues is the performance degradation of its estimates when redundant features are present. A novel theoretical definition of redundancy level is given in order to guide the work towards an extension of the algorithm that is more robust against redundancy. A new extension is presented that aims for improving the algorithms performance. Some experiments were driven to test this new extension against the existing ones with a set of artificial and real datasets and denoted that in certain cases it improves the weight's estimation accuracy."}
{"text": "  This paper presents an algorithm, Voted Kernel Regularization , that provides the flexibility of using potentially very complex kernel functions such as predictors based on much higher-degree polynomial kernels, while benefitting from strong learning guarantees. The success of our algorithm arises from derived bounds that suggest a new regularization penalty in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding families of kernel maps. In a series of experiments we demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithm as compared to baselines. Furthermore, the algorithm enjoys several favorable properties. The optimization problem is convex, it allows for learning with non-PDS kernels, and the solutions are highly sparse, resulting in improved classification speed and memory requirements."}
{"text": "  In this work, we study distance metric learning (DML) for high dimensional data. A typical approach for DML with high dimensional data is to perform the dimensionality reduction first before learning the distance metric. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it may result in a suboptimal solution due to the subspace removed by the dimensionality reduction method. In this work, we present a dual random projection frame for DML with high dimensional data that explicitly addresses the limitation of dimensionality reduction for DML. The key idea is to first project all the data points into a low dimensional space by random projection, and compute the dual variables using the projected vectors. It then reconstructs the distance metric in the original space using the estimated dual variables. The proposed method, on one hand, enjoys the light computation of random projection, and on the other hand, alleviates the limitation of most dimensionality reduction methods. We verify both empirically and theoretically the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for high dimensional DML."}
{"text": "  We study the restless bandit associated with an extremely simple scalar Kalman filter model in discrete time. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the problem is indexable in the sense that the Whittle index is a non-decreasing function of the relevant belief state. In spite of the long history of this problem, this appears to be the first such proof. We use results about Schur-convexity and mechanical words, which are particular binary strings intimately related to palindromes."}
{"text": "  We propose Macau, a powerful and flexible Bayesian factorization method for heterogeneous data. Our model can factorize any set of entities and relations that can be represented by a relational model, including tensors and also multiple relations for each entity. Macau can also incorporate side information, specifically entity and relation features, which are crucial for predicting sparsely observed relations. Macau scales to millions of entity instances, hundred millions of observations, and sparse entity features with millions of dimensions. To achieve the scale up, we specially designed sampling procedure for entity and relation features that relies primarily on noise injection in linear regressions. We show performance and advanced features of Macau in a set of experiments, including challenging drug-protein activity prediction task."}
{"text": "  This paper addresses the problem of scalable optimization for L1-regularized conditional Gaussian graphical models. Conditional Gaussian graphical models generalize the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional distributions to model the output network influenced by conditioning input variables. While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation, state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly, fail due to memory constraints for very large problems. In this paper, we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently iterates over two sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared to the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems under memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show that our methods can solve one million dimensional problems to high accuracy in a little over a day on a single machine."}
{"text": "  The paper is focused on the forecasting method for time series groups with the use of algorithms for cluster analysis. $K$-means algorithm is suggested to be a basic one for clustering. The coordinates of the centers of clusters have been put in correspondence with summarizing time series data the centroids of the clusters. A description of time series, the centroids of the clusters, is implemented with the use of forecasting models. They are based on strict binary trees and a modified clonal selection algorithm. With the help of such forecasting models, the possibility of forming analytic dependences is shown. It is suggested to use a common forecasting model, which is constructed for time series the centroid of the cluster, in forecasting the private (individual) time series in the cluster. The promising application of the suggested method for grouped time series forecasting is demonstrated."}
{"text": "  Tree structures are ubiquitous in data across many domains, and many datasets are naturally modelled by unobserved tree structures. In this paper, first we review the theory of random fragmentation processes [Bertoin, 2006], and a number of existing methods for modelling trees, including the popular nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP). Then we define a general class of probability distributions over trees: the Dirichlet fragmentation process (DFP) through a novel combination of the theory of Dirichlet processes and random fragmentation processes. This DFP presents a stick-breaking construction, and relates to the nCRP in the same way the Dirichlet process relates to the Chinese restaurant process. Furthermore, we develop a novel hierarchical mixture model with the DFP, and empirically compare the new model to similar models in machine learning. Experiments show the DFP mixture model to be convincingly better than existing state-of-the-art approaches for hierarchical clustering and density modelling."}
{"text": "  Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) seem to have displaced traditional 'smooth' nonlinearities as activation-function-du-jour in many - but not all - deep neural network (DNN) applications. However, nobody seems to know why. In this article, we argue that ReLU are useful because they are ideal demodulators - this helps them perform fast abstract learning. However, this fast learning comes at the expense of serious nonlinear distortion products - decoy features. We show that Parallel Dither acts to suppress the decoy features, preventing overfitting and leaving the true features cleanly demodulated for rapid, reliable learning."}
{"text": "  The explosive growth in big data has attracted much attention in designing efficient indexing and search methods recently. In many critical applications such as large-scale search and pattern matching, finding the nearest neighbors to a query is a fundamental research problem. However, the straightforward solution using exhaustive comparison is infeasible due to the prohibitive computational complexity and memory requirement. In response, Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search based on hashing techniques has become popular due to its promising performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Prior randomized hashing methods, e.g., Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), explore data-independent hash functions with random projections or permutations. Although having elegant theoretic guarantees on the search quality in certain metric spaces, performance of randomized hashing has been shown insufficient in many real-world applications. As a remedy, new approaches incorporating data-driven learning methods in development of advanced hash functions have emerged. Such learning to hash methods exploit information such as data distributions or class labels when optimizing the hash codes or functions. Importantly, the learned hash codes are able to preserve the proximity of neighboring data in the original feature spaces in the hash code spaces. The goal of this paper is to provide readers with systematic understanding of insights, pros and cons of the emerging techniques. We provide a comprehensive survey of the learning to hash framework and representative techniques of various types, including unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. In addition, we also summarize recent hashing approaches utilizing the deep learning models. Finally, we discuss the future direction and trends of research in this area."}
{"text": "  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is arguably the most popular of the machine learning methods applied to training deep neural networks (DNN) today. It has recently been demonstrated that SGD can be statistically biased so that certain elements of the training set are learned more rapidly than others. In this article, we place SGD into a feedback loop whereby the probability of selection is proportional to error magnitude. This provides a novelty-driven oddball SGD process that learns more rapidly than traditional SGD by prioritising those elements of the training set with the largest novelty (error). In our DNN example, oddball SGD trains some 50x faster than regular SGD."}
{"text": "  In this paper we develop a statistical theory and an implementation of deep learning models. We show that an elegant variable splitting scheme for the alternating direction method of multipliers optimises a deep learning objective. We allow for non-smooth non-convex regularisation penalties to induce sparsity in parameter weights. We provide a link between traditional shallow layer statistical models such as principal component and sliced inverse regression and deep layer models. We also define the degrees of freedom of a deep learning predictor and a predictive MSE criteria to perform model selection for comparing architecture designs. We focus on deep multiclass logistic learning although our methods apply more generally. Our results suggest an interesting and previously under-exploited relationship between deep learning and proximal splitting techniques. To illustrate our methodology, we provide a multi-class logit classification analysis of Fisher's Iris data where we illustrate the convergence of our algorithm. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research."}
{"text": "  We explore the utility of clustering in reducing error in various prediction tasks. Previous work has hinted at the improvement in prediction accuracy attributed to clustering algorithms if used to pre-process the data. In this work we more deeply investigate the direct utility of using clustering to improve prediction accuracy and provide explanations for why this may be so. We look at a number of datasets, run k-means at different scales and for each scale we train predictors. This produces k sets of predictions. These predictions are then combined by a na\\\"ive ensemble. We observed that this use of a predictor in conjunction with clustering improved the prediction accuracy in most datasets. We believe this indicates the predictive utility of exploiting structure in the data and the data compression handed over by clustering. We also found that using this method improves upon the prediction of even a Random Forests predictor which suggests this method is providing a novel, and useful source of variance in the prediction process."}
{"text": "  The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games."}
{"text": "  Despite their success, convolutional neural networks are computationally expensive because they must examine all image locations. Stochastic attention-based models have been shown to improve computational efficiency at test time, but they remain difficult to train because of intractable posterior inference and high variance in the stochastic gradient estimates. Borrowing techniques from the literature on training deep generative models, we present the Wake-Sleep Recurrent Attention Model, a method for training stochastic attention networks which improves posterior inference and which reduces the variability in the stochastic gradients. We show that our method can greatly speed up the training time for stochastic attention networks in the domains of image classification and caption generation."}
{"text": "  Given i.i.d samples from some unknown continuous density on hyper-rectangle $[0, 1]^d$, we attempt to learn a piecewise constant function that approximates this underlying density non-parametrically. Our density estimate is defined on a binary split of $[0, 1]^d$ and built up sequentially according to discrepancy criteria; the key ingredient is to control the discrepancy adaptively in each sub-rectangle to achieve overall bound. We prove that the estimate, even though simple as it appears, preserves most of the estimation power. By exploiting its structure, it can be directly applied to some important pattern recognition tasks such as mode seeking and density landscape exploration. We demonstrate its applicability through simulations and examples."}
{"text": "  In recent years, quadratic weighted kappa has been growing in popularity in the machine learning community as an evaluation metric in domains where the target labels to be predicted are drawn from integer ratings, usually obtained from human experts. For example, it was the metric of choice in several recent, high profile machine learning contests hosted on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes , https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-sas , https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection . Yet, little is understood about the nature of this metric, its underlying mathematical properties, where it fits among other common evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and correlation, or if it can be optimized analytically, and if so, how. Much of this is due to the cumbersome way that this metric is commonly defined. In this paper we first derive an equivalent but much simpler, and more useful, definition for quadratic weighted kappa, and then employ this alternate form to address the above issues."}
{"text": "  This paper describes an exponential transient excision algorithm (ETEA). In biomedical time series analysis, e.g., in vivo neural recording and electrocorticography (ECoG), some measurement artifacts take the form of piecewise exponential transients. The proposed method is formulated as an unconstrained convex optimization problem, regularized by smoothed l1-norm penalty function, which can be solved by majorization-minimization (MM) method. With a slight modification of the regularizer, ETEA can also suppress more irregular piecewise smooth artifacts, especially, ocular artifacts (OA) in electroencephalog- raphy (EEG) data. Examples of synthetic signal, EEG data, and ECoG data are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "  We propose an off-line approach to explicitly encode temporal patterns spatially as different types of images, namely, Gramian Angular Fields and Markov Transition Fields. This enables the use of techniques from computer vision for feature learning and classification. We used Tiled Convolutional Neural Networks to learn high-level features from individual GAF, MTF, and GAF-MTF images on 12 benchmark time series datasets and two real spatial-temporal trajectory datasets. The classification results of our approach are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on both types of data. An analysis of the features and weights learned by the CNNs explains why the approach works."}
{"text": "  We briefly review recent progress in techniques for modeling and analyzing hyperspectral images and movies, in particular for detecting plumes of both known and unknown chemicals. For detecting chemicals of known spectrum, we extend the technique of using a single subspace for modeling the background to a \"mixture of subspaces\" model to tackle more complicated background. Furthermore, we use partial least squares regression on a resampled training set to boost performance. For the detection of unknown chemicals we view the problem as an anomaly detection problem, and use novel estimators with low-sampled complexity for intrinsically low-dimensional data in high-dimensions that enable us to model the \"normal\" spectra and detect anomalies. We apply these algorithms to benchmark data sets made available by the Automated Target Detection program co-funded by NSF, DTRA and NGA, and compare, when applicable, to current state-of-the-art algorithms, with favorable results."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study a special bandit setting of online stochastic linear optimization, where only one-bit of information is revealed to the learner at each round. This problem has found many applications including online advertisement and online recommendation. We assume the binary feedback is a random variable generated from the logit model, and aim to minimize the regret defined by the unknown linear function. Although the existing method for generalized linear bandit can be applied to our problem, the high computational cost makes it impractical for real-world problems. To address this challenge, we develop an efficient online learning algorithm by exploiting particular structures of the observation model. Specifically, we adopt online Newton step to estimate the unknown parameter and derive a tight confidence region based on the exponential concavity of the logistic loss. Our analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(d\\sqrt{T})$, which matches the optimal result of stochastic linear bandits."}
{"text": "  Clustering is one of the most fundamental problems in data analysis and it has been studied extensively in the literature. Though many clustering algorithms have been proposed, clustering theories that justify the use of these clustering algorithms are still unsatisfactory. In particular, one of the fundamental challenges is to address the following question:   What is a cluster in a set of data points?   In this paper, we make an attempt to address such a question by considering a set of data points associated with a distance measure (metric). We first propose a new cohesion measure in terms of the distance measure. Using the cohesion measure, we define a cluster as a set of points that are cohesive to themselves. For such a definition, we show there are various equivalent statements that have intuitive explanations. We then consider the second question:   How do we find clusters and good partitions of clusters under such a definition?   For such a question, we propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm and a partitional algorithm. Unlike standard hierarchical agglomerative algorithms, our hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has a specific stopping criterion and it stops with a partition of clusters. Our partitional algorithm, called the K-sets algorithm in the paper, appears to be a new iterative algorithm. Unlike the Lloyd iteration that needs two-step minimization, our K-sets algorithm only takes one-step minimization.   One of the most interesting findings of our paper is the duality result between a distance measure and a cohesion measure. Such a duality result leads to a dual K-sets algorithm for clustering a set of data points with a cohesion measure. The dual K-sets algorithm converges in the same way as a sequential version of the classical kernel K-means algorithm. The key difference is that a cohesion measure does not need to be positive semi-definite."}
{"text": "  We study stochastic linear optimization problem with bandit feedback. The set of arms take values in an $N$-dimensional space and belong to a bounded polyhedron described by finitely many linear inequalities. We provide a lower bound for the expected regret that scales as $\\Omega(N\\log T)$. We then provide a nearly optimal algorithm and show that its expected regret scales as $O(N\\log^{1+\\epsilon}(T))$ for an arbitrary small $\\epsilon >0$. The algorithm alternates between exploration and exploitation intervals sequentially where deterministic set of arms are played in the exploration intervals and greedily selected arm is played in the exploitation intervals. We also develop an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret when sub-Gaussianity parameter of the noise term is known. Our key insight is that for a polyhedron the optimal arm is robust to small perturbations in the reward function. Consequently, a greedily selected arm is guaranteed to be optimal when the estimation error falls below some suitable threshold. Our solution resolves a question posed by Rusmevichientong and Tsitsiklis (2011) that left open the possibility of efficient algorithms with asymptotic logarithmic regret bounds. We also show that the regret upper bounds hold with probability $1$. Our numerical investigations show that while theoretical results are asymptotic the performance of our algorithms compares favorably to state-of-the-art algorithms in finite time as well."}
{"text": "  Super-resolution is the problem of recovering a superposition of point sources using bandlimited measurements, which may be corrupted with noise. This signal processing problem arises in numerous imaging problems, ranging from astronomy to biology to spectroscopy, where it is common to take (coarse) Fourier measurements of an object. Of particular interest is in obtaining estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier measurements (bounded by some cutoff frequency); we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run quickly.   Suppose we have k point sources in d dimensions, where the points are separated by at least \\Delta from each other (in Euclidean distance). This work provides an algorithm with the following favorable guarantees: - The algorithm uses Fourier measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by O(1/\\Delta) (up to log factors). Previous algorithms require a cutoff frequency which may be as large as {\\Omega}( d/\\Delta). - The number of measurements taken by and the computational complexity of our algorithm are bounded by a polynomial in both the number of points k and the dimension d, with no dependence on the separation \\Delta. In contrast, previous algorithms depended inverse polynomially on the minimal separation and exponentially on the dimension for both of these quantities.   Our estimation procedure itself is simple: we take random bandlimited measurements (as opposed to taking an exponential number of measurements on the hyper-grid). Furthermore, our analysis and algorithm are elementary (based on concentration bounds for sampling and the singular value decomposition)."}
{"text": "  The nearest neighbor rule is a classic yet essential classification model, particularly in problems where the supervising information is given by pairwise dissimilarities and the embedding function are not easily obtained. Prototype selection provides means of generalization and improving efficiency of the nearest neighbor model, but many existing methods assume and rely on the analyses of the input vector space. In this paper, we explore a dissimilarity-based, parametrized model of the nearest neighbor rule. In the proposed model, the selection of the nearest prototypes is influenced by the parameters of the respective prototypes. It provides a formulation for minimizing the violation of the extended nearest neighbor rule over the training set in a tractable form to exploit numerical techniques. We show that the minimization problem reduces to a large-margin principle learning and demonstrate its advantage by empirical comparisons with other prototype selection methods."}
{"text": "  Hyperspectral data consists of large number of features which require sophisticated analysis to be extracted. A popular approach to reduce computational cost, facilitate information representation and accelerate knowledge discovery is to eliminate bands that do not improve the classification and analysis methods being applied. In particular, algorithms that perform band elimination should be designed to take advantage of the specifics of the classification method being used. This paper employs a recently proposed filter-feature-selection algorithm based on minimizing a tight bound on the VC dimension. We have successfully applied this algorithm to determine a reasonable subset of bands without any user-defined stopping criteria on widely used hyperspectral images and demonstrate that this method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both sparsity of feature set as well as accuracy of classification.\\end{abstract}"}
{"text": "  We consider continuous time Markovian processes where populations of individual agents interact stochastically according to kinetic rules. Despite the increasing prominence of such models in fields ranging from biology to smart cities, Bayesian inference for such systems remains challenging, as these are continuous time, discrete state systems with potentially infinite state-space. Here we propose a novel efficient algorithm for joint state / parameter posterior sampling in population Markov Jump processes. We introduce a class of pseudo-marginal sampling algorithms based on a random truncation method which enables a principled treatment of infinite state spaces. Extensive evaluation on a number of benchmark models shows that this approach achieves considerable savings compared to state of the art methods, retaining accuracy and fast convergence. We also present results on a synthetic biology data set showing the potential for practical usefulness of our work."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of transforming samples from one continuous source distribution into samples from another target distribution. We demonstrate with optimal transport theory that when the source distribution can be easily sampled from and the target distribution is log-concave, this can be tractably solved with convex optimization. We show that a special case of this, when the source is the prior and the target is the posterior, is Bayesian inference. Here, we can tractably calculate the normalization constant and draw posterior i.i.d. samples. Remarkably, our Bayesian tractability criterion is simply log concavity of the prior and likelihood: the same criterion for tractable calculation of the maximum a posteriori point estimate. With simulated data, we demonstrate how we can attain the Bayes risk in simulations. With physiologic data, we demonstrate improvements over point estimation in intensive care unit outcome prediction and electroencephalography-based sleep staging."}
{"text": "  The estimation of probabilities of network edges from the observed adjacency matrix has important applications to predicting missing links and network denoising. It has usually been addressed by estimating the graphon, a function that determines the matrix of edge probabilities, but this is ill-defined without strong assumptions on the network structure. Here we propose a novel computationally efficient method, based on neighborhood smoothing to estimate the expectation of the adjacency matrix directly, without making the structural assumptions that graphon estimation requires. The neighborhood smoothing method requires little tuning, has a competitive mean-squared error rate, and outperforms many benchmark methods on link prediction in simulated and real networks."}
{"text": "  We formulate problems of statistical recognition and learning in a common framework of complex hypothesis testing. Based on arguments from multi-criteria optimization, we identify strategies that are improper for solving these problems and derive a common form of the remaining strategies. We show that some widely used approaches to recognition and learning are improper in this sense. We then propose a generalized formulation of the recognition and learning problem which embraces the whole range of sizes of the learning sample, including the zero size. Learning becomes a special case of recognition without learning. We define the concept of closest to optimal strategy, being a solution to the formulated problem, and describe a technique for finding such a strategy. On several illustrative cases, the strategy is shown to be superior to the widely used learning methods based on maximal likelihood estimation."}
{"text": "  Prediction of survival for cancer patients is an open area of research. However, many of these studies focus on datasets with a large number of patients. We present a novel method that is specifically designed to address the challenge of data scarcity, which is often the case for cancer datasets. Our method is able to use unlabeled data to improve classification by adopting a semi-supervised training approach to learn an ensemble classifier. The results of applying our method to three cancer datasets show the promise of semi-supervised learning for prediction of cancer survival."}
{"text": "  Two popular approaches for distributed training of SVMs on big data are parameter averaging and ADMM. Parameter averaging is efficient but suffers from loss of accuracy with increase in number of partitions, while ADMM in the feature space is accurate but suffers from slow convergence. In this paper, we report a hybrid approach called weighted parameter averaging (WPA), which optimizes the regularized hinge loss with respect to weights on parameters. The problem is shown to be same as solving SVM in a projected space. We also demonstrate an $O(\\frac{1}{N})$ stability bound on final hypothesis given by WPA, using novel proof techniques. Experimental results on a variety of toy and real world datasets show that our approach is significantly more accurate than parameter averaging for high number of partitions. It is also seen the proposed method enjoys much faster convergence compared to ADMM in features space."}
{"text": "  An orthogonal Haar scattering transform is a deep network, computed with a hierarchy of additions, subtractions and absolute values, over pairs of coefficients. It provides a simple mathematical model for unsupervised deep network learning. It implements non-linear contractions, which are optimized for classification, with an unsupervised pair matching algorithm, of polynomial complexity. A structured Haar scattering over graph data computes permutation invariant representations of groups of connected points in the graph. If the graph connectivity is unknown, unsupervised Haar pair learning can provide a consistent estimation of connected dyadic groups of points. Classification results are given on image data bases, defined on regular grids or graphs, with a connectivity which may be known or unknown."}
{"text": "  Gibbs sampling on factor graphs is a widely used inference technique, which often produces good empirical results. Theoretical guarantees for its performance are weak: even for tree structured graphs, the mixing time of Gibbs may be exponential in the number of variables. To help understand the behavior of Gibbs sampling, we introduce a new (hyper)graph property, called hierarchy width. We show that under suitable conditions on the weights, bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time. Our study of hierarchy width is in part motivated by a class of factor graph templates, hierarchical templates, which have bounded hierarchy width---regardless of the data used to instantiate them. We demonstrate a rich application from natural language processing in which Gibbs sampling provably mixes rapidly and achieves accuracy that exceeds human volunteers."}
{"text": "  This is a machine learning application paper involving big data. We present high-accuracy prediction methods of rare events in semi-structured machine log files, which are produced at high velocity and high volume by NORC's computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) network for conducting surveys. We judiciously apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques and data-mining strategies to train effective learning and prediction models for classifying uncommon error messages in the log---without access to source code, updated documentation or dictionaries. In particular, our simple but effective approach of features preallocation for learning from imbalanced data coupled with naive Bayes classifiers can be conceivably generalized to supervised or semi-supervised learning and prediction methods for other critical events such as cyberattack detection."}
{"text": "  A latent space model for a family of random graphs assigns real-valued vectors to nodes of the graph such that edge probabilities are determined by latent positions. Latent space models provide a natural statistical framework for graph visualizing and clustering. A latent space model of particular interest is the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), which can be fit using an efficient spectral method; however, this method is based on a heuristic that can fail, even in simple cases. Here, we consider a closely related latent space model, the Logistic RDPG, which uses a logistic link function to map from latent positions to edge likelihoods. Over this model, we show that asymptotically exact maximum likelihood inference of latent position vectors can be achieved using an efficient spectral method. Our method involves computing top eigenvectors of a normalized adjacency matrix and scaling eigenvectors using a regression step. The novel regression scaling step is an essential part of the proposed method. In simulations, we show that our proposed method is more accurate and more robust than common practices. We also show the effectiveness of our approach over standard real networks of the karate club and political blogs."}
{"text": "  Hierarchical learning models, such as mixture models and Bayesian networks, are widely employed for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering analysis. They consist of observable and hidden variables, which represent the given data and their hidden generation process, respectively. It has been pointed out that conventional statistical analysis is not applicable to these models, because redundancy of the latent variable produces singularities in the parameter space. In recent years, a method based on algebraic geometry has allowed us to analyze the accuracy of predicting observable variables when using Bayesian estimation. However, how to analyze latent variables has not been sufficiently studied, even though one of the main issues in unsupervised learning is to determine how accurately the latent variable is estimated. A previous study proposed a method that can be used when the range of the latent variable is redundant compared with the model generating data. The present paper extends that method to the situation in which the latent variables have redundant dimensions. We formulate new error functions and derive their asymptotic forms. Calculation of the error functions is demonstrated in two-layered Bayesian networks."}
{"text": "  Information projections are the key building block of variational inference algorithms and are used to approximate a target probabilistic model by projecting it onto a family of tractable distributions. In general, there is no guarantee on the quality of the approximation obtained. To overcome this issue, we introduce a new class of random projections to reduce the dimensionality and hence the complexity of the original model. In the spirit of random projections, the projection preserves (with high probability) key properties of the target distribution. We show that information projections can be combined with random projections to obtain provable guarantees on the quality of the approximation obtained, regardless of the complexity of the original model. We demonstrate empirically that augmenting mean field with a random projection step dramatically improves partition function and marginal probability estimates, both on synthetic and real world data."}
{"text": "  We consider the \\mnk{classical} problem of a controller activating (or sampling) sequentially from a finite number of $N \\geq 2$ populations, specified by unknown distributions. Over some time horizon, at each time $n = 1, 2, \\ldots$, the controller wishes to select a population to sample, with the goal of sampling from a population that optimizes some \"score\" function of its distribution, e.g., maximizing the expected sum of outcomes or minimizing variability. We define a class of \\textit{Uniformly Fast (UF)} sampling policies and show, under mild regularity conditions, that there is an asymptotic lower bound for the expected total number of sub-optimal population activations. Then, we provide sufficient conditions under which a UCB policy is UF and asymptotically optimal, since it attains this lower bound. Explicit solutions are provided for a number of examples of interest, including general score functionals on unconstrained Pareto distributions (of potentially infinite mean), and uniform distributions of unknown support. Additional results on bandits of Normal distributions are also provided."}
{"text": "  Deep CCA is a recently proposed deep neural network extension to the traditional canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and has been successful for multi-view representation learning in several domains. However, stochastic optimization of the deep CCA objective is not straightforward, because it does not decouple over training examples. Previous optimizers for deep CCA are either batch-based algorithms or stochastic optimization using large minibatches, which can have high memory consumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of stochastic optimization for deep CCA with small minibatches, based on an iterative solution to the CCA objective, and show that we can achieve as good performance as previous optimizers and thus alleviate the memory requirement."}
{"text": "  We consider sequential decision making problems for binary classification scenario in which the learner takes an active role in repeatedly selecting samples from the action pool and receives the binary label of the selected alternatives. Our problem is motivated by applications where observations are time consuming and/or expensive, resulting in small samples. The goal is to identify the best alternative with the highest response. We use Bayesian logistic regression to predict the response of each alternative. By formulating the problem as a Markov decision process, we develop a knowledge-gradient type policy to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information of labeling each alternative and provide a finite-time analysis on the estimated error. Experiments on benchmark UCI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  When training deep neural networks, it is typically assumed that the training examples are uniformly difficult to learn. Or, to restate, it is assumed that the training error will be uniformly distributed across the training examples. Based on these assumptions, each training example is used an equal number of times. However, this assumption may not be valid in many cases. \"Oddball SGD\" (novelty-driven stochastic gradient descent) was recently introduced to drive training probabilistically according to the error distribution - training frequency is proportional to training error magnitude. In this article, using a deep neural network to encode a video, we show that oddball SGD can be used to enforce uniform error across the training set."}

{"text": "  We show that Langevin MCMC inference in an energy-based model with latent variables has the property that the early steps of inference, starting from a stationary point, correspond to propagating error gradients into internal layers, similarly to back-propagation. The error that is back-propagated is with respect to visible units that have received an outside driving force pushing them away from the stationary point. Back-propagated error gradients correspond to temporal derivatives of the activation of hidden units. This observation could be an element of a theory for explaining how brains perform credit assignment in deep hierarchies as efficiently as back-propagation does. In this theory, the continuous-valued latent variables correspond to averaged voltage potential (across time, spikes, and possibly neurons in the same minicolumn), and neural computation corresponds to approximate inference and error back-propagation at the same time."}
{"text": "  In this paper we introduce a novel online time series forecasting model we refer to as the pM-GP filter. We show that our model is equivalent to Gaussian process regression, with the advantage that both online forecasting and online learning of the hyper-parameters have a constant (rather than cubic) time complexity and a constant (rather than squared) memory requirement in the number of observations, without resorting to approximations. Moreover, the proposed model is expressive in that the family of covariance functions of the implied latent process, namely the spectral Matern kernels, have recently been proven to be capable of approximating arbitrarily well any translation-invariant covariance function. The benefit of our approach compared to competing models is demonstrated using experiments on several real-life datasets."}
{"text": "  In model-based solution approaches to the problem of learning in an unknown environment, exploring to learn the model parameters takes a toll on the regret. The optimal performance with respect to regret or PAC bounds is achievable, if the algorithm exploits with respect to reward or explores with respect to the model parameters, respectively. In this paper, we propose TSEB, a Thompson Sampling based algorithm with adaptive exploration bonus that aims to solve the problem with tighter PAC guarantees, while being cautious on the regret as well. The proposed approach maintains distributions over the model parameters which are successively refined with more experience. At any given time, the agent solves a model sampled from this distribution, and the sampled reward distribution is skewed by an exploration bonus in order to generate more informative exploration. The policy by solving is then used for generating more experience that helps in updating the posterior over the model parameters. We provide a detailed analysis of the PAC guarantees, and convergence of the proposed approach. We show that our adaptive exploration bonus encourages the additional exploration required for better PAC bounds on the algorithm. We provide empirical analysis on two different simulated domains."}
{"text": "  Feature selection plays an important role in the data mining process. It is needed to deal with the excessive number of features, which can become a computational burden on the learning algorithms. It is also necessary, even when computational resources are not scarce, since it improves the accuracy of the machine learning tasks, as we will see in the upcoming sections. In this review, we discuss the different feature selection approaches, and the relation between them and the various machine learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  Algorithm designers typically assume that the input data is correct, and then proceed to find \"optimal\" or \"sub-optimal\" solutions using this input data. However this assumption of correct data does not always hold in practice, especially in the context of online learning systems where the objective is to learn appropriate feature weights given some training samples. Such scenarios necessitate the study of inverse optimization problems where one is given an input instance as well as a desired output and the task is to adjust the input data so that the given output is indeed optimal. Motivated by learning structured prediction models, in this paper we consider inverse optimization with a margin, i.e., we require the given output to be better than all other feasible outputs by a desired margin. We consider such inverse optimization problems for maximum weight matroid basis, matroid intersection, perfect matchings, minimum cost maximum flows, and shortest paths and derive the first known results for such problems with a non-zero margin. The effectiveness of these algorithmic approaches to online learning for structured prediction is also discussed."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of extracting a low-dimensional, linear latent variable structure from high-dimensional random variables. Specifically, we show that under mild conditions and when this structure manifests itself as a linear space that spans the conditional means, it is possible to consistently recover the structure using only information up to the second moments of these random variables. This finding, specialized to one-parameter exponential families whose variance function is quadratic in their means, allows for the derivation of an explicit estimator of such latent structure. This approach serves as a latent variable model estimator and as a tool for dimension reduction for a high-dimensional matrix of data composed of many related variables. Our theoretical results are verified by simulation studies and an application to genomic data."}
{"text": "  We study the improper learning of multi-layer neural networks. Suppose that the neural network to be learned has $k$ hidden layers and that the $\\ell_1$-norm of the incoming weights of any neuron is bounded by $L$. We present a kernel-based method, such that with probability at least $1 - \\delta$, it learns a predictor whose generalization error is at most $\\epsilon$ worse than that of the neural network. The sample complexity and the time complexity of the presented method are polynomial in the input dimension and in $(1/\\epsilon,\\log(1/\\delta),F(k,L))$, where $F(k,L)$ is a function depending on $(k,L)$ and on the activation function, independent of the number of neurons. The algorithm applies to both sigmoid-like activation functions and ReLU-like activation functions. It implies that any sufficiently sparse neural network is learnable in polynomial time."}
{"text": "  Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are endowed with the universal power of modeling (binary) joint distributions. Meanwhile, as a result of their confining network structure, training RBMs confronts less difficulties (compared with more complicated models, e.g., Boltzmann machines) when dealing with approximation and inference issues. However, in certain computational biology scenarios, such as the cancer data analysis, employing RBMs to model data features may lose its efficacy due to the \"$p\\gg N$\" problem, in which the number of features/predictors is much larger than the sample size. The \"$p\\gg N$\" problem puts the bias-variance trade-off in a more crucial place when designing statistical learning methods. In this manuscript, we try to address this problem by proposing a novel RBM model, called elastic restricted Boltzmann machine (eRBM), which incorporates the elastic regularization term into the likelihood/cost function. We provide several theoretical analysis on the superiority of our model. Furthermore, attributed to the classic contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm, eRBMs can be trained efficiently. Our novel model is a promising method for future cancer data analysis."}
{"text": "  In order to identify important variables that are involved in making optimal treatment decision, Lu et al. (2013) proposed a penalized least squared regression framework for a fixed number of predictors, which is robust against the misspecification of the conditional mean model. Two problems arise: (i) in a world of explosively big data, effective methods are needed to handle ultra-high dimensional data set, for example, with the dimension of predictors is of the non-polynomial (NP) order of the sample size; (ii) both the propensity score and conditional mean models need to be estimated from data under NP dimensionality.   In this paper, we propose a two-step estimation procedure for deriving the optimal treatment regime under NP dimensionality. In both steps, penalized regressions are employed with the non-concave penalty function, where the conditional mean model of the response given predictors may be misspecified. The asymptotic properties, such as weak oracle properties, selection consistency and oracle distributions, of the proposed estimators are investigated. In addition, we study the limiting distribution of the estimated value function for the obtained optimal treatment regime. The empirical performance of the proposed estimation method is evaluated by simulations and an application to a depression dataset from the STAR*D study."}
{"text": "  The online Markov decision process (MDP) is a generalization of the classical Markov decision process that incorporates changing reward functions. In this paper, we propose practical online MDP algorithms with policy iteration and theoretically establish a sublinear regret bound. A notable advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can be easily combined with function approximation, and thus large and possibly continuous state spaces can be efficiently handled. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Quantification is the task of estimating the class-distribution of a data-set. While typically considered as a parameter estimation problem with strict assumptions on the data-set shift, we consider quantification in-the-wild, on two large scale data-sets from marine ecology: a survey of Caribbean coral reefs, and a plankton time series from Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. We investigate several quantification methods from the literature and indicate opportunities for future work. In particular, we show that a deep neural network can be fine-tuned on a very limited amount of data (25 - 100 samples) to outperform alternative methods."}
{"text": "  We address the problem of detecting changes in multivariate datastreams, and we investigate the intrinsic difficulty that change-detection methods have to face when the data dimension scales. In particular, we consider a general approach where changes are detected by comparing the distribution of the log-likelihood of the datastream over different time windows. Despite the fact that this approach constitutes the frame of several change-detection methods, its effectiveness when data dimension scales has never been investigated, which is indeed the goal of our paper. We show that the magnitude of the change can be naturally measured by the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions, and that the detectability of a change of a given magnitude worsens when the data dimension increases. This problem, which we refer to as \\emph{detectability loss}, is due to the linear relationship between the variance of the log-likelihood and the data dimension. We analytically derive the detectability loss on Gaussian-distributed datastreams, and empirically demonstrate that this problem holds also on real-world datasets and that can be harmful even at low data-dimensions (say, 10)."}
{"text": "  This is the first of a series of papers that the authors propose to write on the subject of improving the speed of response of learning systems using multiple models. During the past two decades, the first author has worked on numerous methods for improving the stability, robustness, and performance of adaptive systems using multiple models and the other authors have collaborated with him on some of them. Independently, they have also worked on several learning methods, and have considerable experience with their advantages and limitations. In particular, they are well aware that it is common knowledge that machine learning is in general very slow. Numerous attempts have been made by researchers to improve the speed of convergence of algorithms in different contexts. In view of the success of multiple model based methods in improving the speed of convergence in adaptive systems, the authors believe that the same approach will also prove fruitful in the domain of learning. In this paper, a first attempt is made to use multiple models for improving the speed of response of the simplest learning schemes that have been studied. i.e. Learning Automata."}
{"text": "  Gradient backpropagation (BP) requires symmetric feedforward and feedback connections -- the same weights must be used for forward and backward passes. This \"weight transport problem\" (Grossberg 1987) is thought to be one of the main reasons to doubt BP's biologically plausibility. Using 15 different classification datasets, we systematically investigate to what extent BP really depends on weight symmetry. In a study that turned out to be surprisingly similar in spirit to Lillicrap et al.'s demonstration (Lillicrap et al. 2014) but orthogonal in its results, our experiments indicate that: (1) the magnitudes of feedback weights do not matter to performance (2) the signs of feedback weights do matter -- the more concordant signs between feedforward and their corresponding feedback connections, the better (3) with feedback weights having random magnitudes and 100% concordant signs, we were able to achieve the same or even better performance than SGD. (4) some normalizations/stabilizations are indispensable for such asymmetric BP to work, namely Batch Normalization (BN) (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) and/or a \"Batch Manhattan\" (BM) update rule."}
{"text": "  Robust Bayesian models are appealing alternatives to standard models, providing protection from data that contains outliers or other departures from the model assumptions. Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches, especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation."}
{"text": "  We introduce a multivariate stochastic volatility model for asset returns that imposes no restrictions to the structure of the volatility matrix and treats all its elements as functions of latent stochastic processes. When the number of assets is prohibitively large, we propose a factor multivariate stochastic volatility model in which the variances and correlations of the factors evolve stochastically over time. Inference is achieved via a carefully designed feasible and scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that combines two computationally important ingredients: it utilizes invariant to the prior Metropolis proposal densities for simultaneously updating all latent paths and has quadratic, rather than cubic, computational complexity when evaluating the multivariate normal densities required. We apply our modelling and computational methodology to $571$ stock daily returns of Euro STOXX index for data over a period of $10$ years. MATLAB software for this paper is available at http://www.aueb.gr/users/mtitsias/code/msv.zip."}
{"text": "  Clustering algorithms start with a fixed divergence, which captures the possibly asymmetric distance between a sample and a centroid. In the mixture model setting, the sample distribution plays the same role. When all attributes have the same topology and dispersion, the data are said to be homogeneous. If the prior knowledge of the distribution is inaccurate or the set of plausible distributions is large, an adaptive approach is essential. The motivation is more compelling for heterogeneous data, where the dispersion or the topology differs among attributes. We propose an adaptive approach to clustering using classes of parametrized Bregman divergences. We first show that the density of a steep exponential dispersion model (EDM) can be represented with a Bregman divergence. We then propose AdaCluster, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to cluster heterogeneous data using classes of steep EDMs. We compare AdaCluster with EM for a Gaussian mixture model on synthetic data and nine UCI data sets. We also propose an adaptive hard clustering algorithm based on Generalized Method of Moments. We compare the hard clustering algorithm with k-means on the UCI data sets. We empirically verified that adaptively learning the underlying topology yields better clustering of heterogeneous data."}

{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of stochastic optimization under a bandit feedback model. We generalize the GP-UCB algorithm [Srinivas and al., 2012] to arbitrary kernels and search spaces. To do so, we use a notion of localized chaining to control the supremum of a Gaussian process, and provide a novel optimization scheme based on the computation of covering numbers. The theoretical bounds we obtain on the cumulative regret are more generic and present the same convergence rates as the GP-UCB algorithm. Finally, the algorithm is shown to be empirically more efficient than its natural competitors on simple and complex input spaces."}

{"text": "  Early stopping is a well known approach to reduce the time complexity for performing training and model selection of large scale learning machines. On the other hand, memory/space (rather than time) complexity is the main constraint in many applications, and randomized subsampling techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. In this paper we ask whether early stopping and subsampling ideas can be combined in a fruitful way. We consider the question in a least squares regression setting and propose a form of randomized iterative regularization based on early stopping and subsampling. In this context, we analyze the statistical and computational properties of the proposed method. Theoretical results are complemented and validated by a thorough experimental analysis."}
{"text": "  Consider a binary classification problem in which the learner is given a labeled training set, an unlabeled test set, and is restricted to choosing exactly $k$ test points to output as positive predictions. Problems of this kind---{\\it transductive precision@$k$}---arise in information retrieval, digital advertising, and reserve design for endangered species. Previous methods separate the training of the model from its use in scoring the test points. This paper introduces a new approach, Transductive Top K (TTK), that seeks to minimize the hinge loss over all training instances under the constraint that exactly $k$ test instances are predicted as positive. The paper presents two optimization methods for this challenging problem. Experiments and analysis confirm the importance of incorporating the knowledge of $k$ into the learning process. Experimental evaluations of the TTK approach show that the performance of TTK matches or exceeds existing state-of-the-art methods on 7 UCI datasets and 3 reserve design problem instances."}
{"text": "  We present an efficient method for training slack-rescaled structural SVM. Although finding the most violating label in a margin-rescaled formulation is often easy since the target function decomposes with respect to the structure, this is not the case for a slack-rescaled formulation, and finding the most violated label might be very difficult. Our core contribution is an efficient method for finding the most-violating-label in a slack-rescaled formulation, given an oracle that returns the most-violating-label in a (slightly modified) margin-rescaled formulation. We show that our method enables accurate and scalable training for slack-rescaled SVMs, reducing runtime by an order of magnitude compared to previous approaches to slack-rescaled SVMs."}

If available, using multiple relations (or graphs) between the instances can improve the prediction performance. On the other hand, when these relations have varying levels of veracity and exhibit varying relevance for the task, very noisy and/or irrelevant relations may deteriorate the performance. As a result, an effective weighing scheme needs to be put in place. In this work, we propose a robust and scalable approach for multi-relational graph-regularized semi-supervised classification. Under a convex optimization scheme, we simultaneously infer weights for the multiple graphs as well as a solution. We provide a careful analysis of the inferred weights, based on which we devise an algorithm that filters out irrelevant and noisy graphs and produces weights proportional to the informativeness of the remaining graphs. Moreover, the proposed method is linearly scalable w.r.t. the number of edges in the union of the multiple graphs. Through extensive experiments we show that our method yields superior results under different noise models, and under increasing number of noisy graphs and intensity of noise, as compared to a list of baselines and state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel method for multiple clustering that assumes a co-clustering structure (partitions in both rows and columns of the data matrix) in each view. The new method is applicable to high-dimensional data. It is based on a nonparametric Bayesian approach in which the number of views and the number of feature-/subject clusters are inferred in a data-driven manner. We simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and multinomial distributions in each cluster block. This makes our method applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical variables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based on variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed method to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other multiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in computation time. Finally, we apply our method to a depression dataset with no true cluster structure available, from which useful inferences are drawn about possible clustering structures of the data."}
{"text": "  We present GLASSES: Global optimisation with Look-Ahead through Stochastic Simulation and Expected-loss Search. The majority of global optimisation approaches in use are myopic, in only considering the impact of the next function value; the non-myopic approaches that do exist are able to consider only a handful of future evaluations. Our novel algorithm, GLASSES, permits the consideration of dozens of evaluations into the future. This is done by approximating the ideal look-ahead loss function, which is expensive to evaluate, by a cheaper alternative in which the future steps of the algorithm are simulated beforehand. An Expectation Propagation algorithm is used to compute the expected value of the loss.We show that the far-horizon planning thus enabled leads to substantive performance gains in empirical tests."}
{"text": "  Inventory control with unknown demand distribution is considered, with emphasis placed on the case involving discrete nonperishable items. We focus on an adaptive policy which in every period uses, as much as possible, the optimal newsvendor ordering quantity for the empirical distribution learned up to that period. The policy is assessed using the regret criterion, which measures the price paid for ambiguity on demand distribution over $T$ periods. When there are guarantees on the latter's separation from the critical newsvendor parameter $\\beta=b/(h+b)$, a constant upper bound on regret can be found. Without any prior information on the demand distribution, we show that the regret does not grow faster than the rate $T^{1/2+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. In view of a known lower bound, this is almost the best one could hope for. Simulation studies involving this along with other policies are also conducted."}
{"text": "  We present tree- and list- structured density estimation methods for high dimensional binary/categorical data. Our density estimation models are high dimensional analogies to variable bin width histograms. In each leaf of the tree (or list), the density is constant, similar to the flat density within the bin of a histogram. Histograms, however, cannot easily be visualized in higher dimensions, whereas our models can. The accuracy of histograms fades as dimensions increase, whereas our models have priors that help with generalization. Our models are sparse, unlike high-dimensional histograms. We present three generative models, where the first one allows the user to specify the number of desired leaves in the tree within a Bayesian prior. The second model allows the user to specify the desired number of branches within the prior. The third model returns lists (rather than trees) and allows the user to specify the desired number of rules and the length of rules within the prior. Our results indicate that the new approaches yield a better balance between sparsity and accuracy of density estimates than other methods for this task."}

Lastly, the specifics of the system are explained, and some experimental results are presented to prove the effectiveness of the system."}

{"text": "  Estimating the strength of dependency between two variables is fundamental for exploratory analysis and many other applications in data mining. For example: non-linear dependencies between two continuous variables can be explored with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC); and categorical variables that are dependent to the target class are selected using Gini gain in random forests. Nonetheless, because dependency measures are estimated on finite samples, the interpretability of their quantification and the accuracy when ranking dependencies become challenging. Dependency estimates are not equal to 0 when variables are independent, cannot be compared if computed on different sample size, and they are inflated by chance on variables with more categories. In this paper, we propose a framework to adjust dependency measure estimates on finite samples. Our adjustments, which are simple and applicable to any dependency measure, are helpful in improving interpretability when quantifying dependency and in improving accuracy on the task of ranking dependencies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the interpretability of MIC when used as a proxy for the amount of noise between variables, and to gain accuracy when ranking variables during the splitting procedure in random forests."}
{"text": "  We present Blitzkriging, a new approach to fast inference for Gaussian processes, applicable to regression, optimisation and classification. State-of-the-art (stochastic) inference for Gaussian processes on very large datasets scales cubically in the number of 'inducing inputs', variables introduced to factorise the model. Blitzkriging shares state-of-the-art scaling with data, but reduces the scaling in the number of inducing points to approximately linear. Further, in contrast to other methods, Blitzkriging: does not force the data to conform to any particular structure (including grid-like); reduces reliance on error-prone optimisation of inducing point locations; and is able to learn rich (covariance) structure from the data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on real data in regression, time-series prediction and signal-interpolation experiments."}
{"text": "  Laplacian Eigenvectors of the graph constructed from a data set are used in many spectral manifold learning algorithms such as diffusion maps and spectral clustering. Given a graph constructed from a random sample of a $d$-dimensional compact submanifold $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, we establish the spectral convergence rate of the graph Laplacian. It implies the consistency of the spectral clustering algorithm via a standard perturbation argument. A simple numerical study indicates the necessity of a denoising step before applying spectral algorithms."}
{"text": "  Kernel methods obtain superb performance in terms of accuracy for various machine learning tasks since they can effectively extract nonlinear relations. However, their time complexity can be rather large especially for clustering tasks. In this paper we define a general class of kernels that can be easily approximated by randomization. These kernels appear in various applications, in particular, traditional spectral clustering, landmark-based spectral clustering and landmark-based subspace clustering. We show that for $n$ data points from $K$ clusters with $D$ landmarks, the randomization procedure results in an algorithm of complexity $O(KnD)$. Furthermore, we bound the error between the original clustering scheme and its randomization. To illustrate the power of this framework, we propose a new fast landmark subspace (FLS) clustering algorithm. Experiments over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FLS in accelerating subspace clustering with marginal sacrifice of accuracy."}
{"text": "  Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are popular tools for studying network structures. However, many modern applications such as gene network discovery and social interactions analysis often involve high-dimensional noisy data with outliers or heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose the Trimmed Graphical Lasso for robust estimation of sparse GGMs. Our method guards against outliers by an implicit trimming mechanism akin to the popular Least Trimmed Squares method used for linear regression. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of our estimator in the high-dimensional setting. In contrast, existing approaches for robust sparse GGMs estimation lack statistical guarantees. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on simulated and real gene expression data which further demonstrate the value of our approach."}
{"text": "  The singular value decomposition (SVD) is not only a classical theory in matrix computation and analysis, but also is a powerful tool in machine learning and modern data analysis. In this tutorial we first study the basic notion of SVD and then show the central role of SVD in matrices. Using majorization theory, we consider variational principles of singular values and eigenvalues. Built on SVD and a theory of symmetric gauge functions, we discuss unitarily invariant norms, which are then used to formulate general results for matrix low rank approximation. We study the subdifferentials of unitarily invariant norms. These results would be potentially useful in many machine learning problems such as matrix completion and matrix data classification. Finally, we discuss matrix low rank approximation and its recent developments such as randomized SVD, approximate matrix multiplication, CUR decomposition, and Nystrom approximation. Randomized algorithms are important approaches to large scale SVD as well as fast matrix computations."}
{"text": "  In this paper we study nonconvex penalization using Bernstein functions whose first-order derivatives are completely monotone. The Bernstein function can induce a class of nonconvex penalty functions for high-dimensional sparse estimation problems. We derive a thresholding function based on the Bernstein penalty and discuss some important mathematical properties in sparsity modeling. We show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for regression problems penalized by the Bernstein function. We also consider the application of the Bernstein penalty in classification problems and devise a proximal alternating linearized minimization method. Based on theory of the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality, we conduct convergence analysis of these alternating iteration procedures. We particularly exemplify a family of Bernstein nonconvex penalties based on a generalized Gamma measure and conduct empirical analysis for this family."}
{"text": "  We present an attention-based modular neural framework for computer vision. The framework uses a soft attention mechanism allowing models to be trained with gradient descent. It consists of three modules: a recurrent attention module controlling where to look in an image or video frame, a feature-extraction module providing a representation of what is seen, and an objective module formalizing why the model learns its attentive behavior. The attention module allows the model to focus computation on task-related information in the input. We apply the framework to several object tracking tasks and explore various design choices. We experiment with three data sets, bouncing ball, moving digits and the real-world KTH data set. The proposed Recurrent Attentive Tracking Model performs well on all three tasks and can generalize to related but previously unseen sequences from a challenging tracking data set."}
{"text": "  Since the early 1980s, the research community has developed ever more sophisticated algorithms for the problem of energy disaggregation, but despite decades of research, there is still a dearth of applications with demonstrated value. In this work, we explore a question that is highly pertinent to this research community: how good does energy disaggregation need to be in order to infer characteristics of a household? We present novel techniques that use unsupervised energy disaggregation to predict both household occupancy and static properties of the household such as size of the home and number of occupants. Results show that basic disaggregation approaches performs up to 30% better at occupancy estimation than using aggregate power data alone, and are up to 10% better at estimating static household characteristics. These results show that even rudimentary energy disaggregation techniques are sufficient for improved inference of household characteristics. To conclude, we re-evaluate the bar set by the community for energy disaggregation accuracy and try to answer the question \"how good is good enough?\""}
{"text": "  We investigate attention as the active pursuit of useful information. This contrasts with attention as a mechanism for the attenuation of irrelevant information. We also consider the role of short-term memory, whose use is critical to any model incapable of simultaneously perceiving all information on which its output depends. We present several simple synthetic tasks, which become considerably more interesting when we impose strong constraints on how a model can interact with its input, and on how long it can take to produce its output. We develop a model with a different structure from those seen in previous work, and we train it using stochastic variational inference with a learned proposal distribution."}
{"text": "  Given a multi-armed bandit problem it may be desirable to achieve a smaller-than-usual worst-case regret for some special actions. I show that the price for such unbalanced worst-case regret guarantees is rather high. Specifically, if an algorithm enjoys a worst-case regret of B with respect to some action, then there must exist another action for which the worst-case regret is at least {\\Omega}(nK/B), where n is the horizon and K the number of actions. I also give upper bounds in both the stochastic and adversarial settings showing that this result cannot be improved. For the stochastic case the pareto regret frontier is characterised exactly up to constant factors."}
{"text": "  This paper studies theoretically and empirically a method of turning machine-learning algorithms into probabilistic predictors that automatically enjoys a property of validity (perfect calibration) and is computationally efficient. The price to pay for perfect calibration is that these probabilistic predictors produce imprecise (in practice, almost precise for large data sets) probabilities. When these imprecise probabilities are merged into precise probabilities, the resulting predictors, while losing the theoretical property of perfect calibration, are consistently more accurate than the existing methods in empirical studies."}
{"text": "  Building recommendation algorithms is one of the most challenging tasks in Machine Learning. Although most of the recommendation systems are built on explicit feedback available from the users in terms of rating or text, a majority of the applications do not receive such feedback. Here we consider the recommendation task where the only available data is the records of user-item interaction over web applications over time, in terms of subscription or purchase of items; this is known as implicit feedback recommendation. There is usually a massive amount of such user-item interaction available for any web applications. Algorithms like PLSI or Matrix Factorization runs several iterations through the dataset, and may prove very expensive for large datasets. Here we propose a recommendation algorithm based on Method of Moment, which involves factorization of second and third order moments of the dataset. Our algorithm can be proven to be globally convergent using PAC learning theory. Further, we show how to extract the parameters using only three passes through the entire dataset. This results in a highly scalable algorithm that scales up to million of users even on a machine with a single-core processor and 8 GB RAM and produces competitive performance in comparison with existing algorithms."}
{"text": "  Dimensionality reduction methods are very common in the field of high dimensional data analysis. Typically, algorithms for dimensionality reduction are computationally expensive. Therefore, their applications for the analysis of massive amounts of data are impractical. For example, repeated computations due to accumulated data are computationally prohibitive. In this paper, an out-of-sample extension scheme, which is used as a complementary method for dimensionality reduction, is presented. We describe an algorithm which performs an out-of-sample extension to newly-arrived data points. Unlike other extension algorithms such as Nystr\\\"om algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses the intrinsic geometry of the data and properties for dimensionality reduction map. We prove that the error of the proposed algorithm is bounded. Additionally to the out-of-sample extension, the algorithm provides a degree of the abnormality of any newly-arrived data point."}
{"text": "  We propose novel model transfer-learning methods that refine a decision forest model M learned within a \"source\" domain using a training set sampled from a \"target\" domain, assumed to be a variation of the source. We present two random forest transfer algorithms. The first algorithm searches greedily for locally optimal modifications of each tree structure by trying to locally expand or reduce the tree around individual nodes. The second algorithm does not modify structure, but only the parameter (thresholds) associated with decision nodes. We also propose to combine both methods by considering an ensemble that contains the union of the two forests. The proposed methods exhibit impressive experimental results over a range of problems."}
{"text": "  In life sciences, the experts generally use empirical knowledge to recode variables, choose interactions and perform selection by classical approach. The aim of this work is to perform automatic learning algorithm for variables selection which can lead to know if experts can be help in they decision or simply replaced by the machine and improve they knowledge and results. The Lasso method can detect the optimal subset of variables for estimation and prediction under some conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which uses automatically all variables available and all interactions. By a double cross-validation combine with Lasso, we select a best subset of variables and with GLM through a simple cross-validation perform predictions. The algorithm assures the stability and the the consistency of estimators."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we utilize stochastic optimization to reduce the space complexity of convex composite optimization with a nuclear norm regularizer, where the variable is a matrix of size $m \\times n$. By constructing a low-rank estimate of the gradient, we propose an iterative algorithm based on stochastic proximal gradient descent (SPGD), and take the last iterate of SPGD as the final solution. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that its space complexity is $O(m+n)$, in contrast, most of previous algorithms have a $O(mn)$ space complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that it achieves $O(\\log T/\\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\\log T/T)$ convergence rates for general convex functions and strongly convex functions, respectively."}
{"text": "  Consider the binary classification problem of predicting a target variable $Y$ from a discrete feature vector $X = (X_1,...,X_d)$. When the probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}(X,Y)$ is known, the optimal classifier, leading to the minimum misclassification rate, is given by the Maximum A-posteriori Probability decision rule. However, estimating the complete joint distribution $\\mathbb{P}(X,Y)$ is computationally and statistically impossible for large values of $d$. An alternative approach is to first estimate some low order marginals of $\\mathbb{P}(X,Y)$ and then design the classifier based on the estimated low order marginals. This approach is also helpful when the complete training data instances are not available due to privacy concerns. In this work, we consider the problem of finding the optimum classifier based on some estimated low order marginals of $(X,Y)$. We prove that for a given set of marginals, the minimum Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi (HGR) correlation principle introduced in [1] leads to a randomized classification rule which is shown to have a misclassification rate no larger than twice the misclassification rate of the optimal classifier. Then, under a separability condition, we show that the proposed algorithm is equivalent to a randomized linear regression approach. In addition, this method naturally results in a robust feature selection method selecting a subset of features having the maximum worst case HGR correlation with the target variable. Our theoretical upper-bound is similar to the recent Discrete Chebyshev Classifier (DCC) approach [2], while the proposed algorithm has significant computational advantages since it only requires solving a least square optimization problem. Finally, we numerically compare our proposed algorithm with the DCC classifier and show that the proposed algorithm results in better misclassification rate over various datasets."}
{"text": "  Currently, machine learning plays an important role in the lives and individual activities of numerous people. Accordingly, it has become necessary to design machine learning algorithms to ensure that discrimination, biased views, or unfair treatment do not result from decision making or predictions made via machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework for supervised learning, neutralized ERM (NERM) that ensures that any classifiers obtained can be guaranteed to be neutral with respect to a viewpoint hypothesis. More specifically, given a viewpoint hypothesis, NERM works to find a target hypothesis that minimizes the empirical risk while simultaneously identifying a target hypothesis that is neutral to the viewpoint hypothesis. Within the NERM framework, we derive a theoretical bound on empirical and generalization neutrality risks. Furthermore, as a realization of NERM with linear classification, we derive a max-margin algorithm, neutral support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that our neutral SVM shows improved classification performance in real datasets without sacrificing the neutrality guarantee."}
{"text": "  We present diffusion-convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), a new model for graph-structured data. Through the introduction of a diffusion-convolution operation, we show how diffusion-based representations can be learned from graph-structured data and used as an effective basis for node classification. DCNNs have several attractive qualities, including a latent representation for graphical data that is invariant under isomorphism, as well as polynomial-time prediction and learning that can be represented as tensor operations and efficiently implemented on the GPU. Through several experiments with real structured datasets, we demonstrate that DCNNs are able to outperform probabilistic relational models and kernel-on-graph methods at relational node classification tasks."}
{"text": "  We propose a framework to perform streaming covariance selection. Our approach employs regularization constraints where a time-varying sparsity parameter is iteratively estimated via stochastic gradient descent. This allows for the regularization parameter to be efficiently learnt in an online manner. The proposed framework is developed for linear regression models and extended to graphical models via neighbourhood selection. Under mild assumptions, we are able to obtain convergence results in a non-stochastic setting. The capabilities of such an approach are demonstrated using both synthetic data as well as neuroimaging data."}
{"text": "  In order for the predicted interactions to be directly adopted by biologists, the ma- chine learning predictions have to be of high precision, regardless of recall. This aspect cannot be evaluated or numerically represented well by traditional metrics like accuracy, ROC, or precision-recall curve. In this work, we start from the alignment in sensitivity of ROC and recall of precision-recall curve, and propose an evaluation metric focusing on the ability of a model to be adopted by biologists. This metric evaluates the ability of a machine learning algorithm to predict only new interactions, meanwhile, it eliminates the influence of test dataset. In the experiment of evaluating different classifiers with a same data set and evaluating the same predictor with different datasets, our new metric fulfills the evaluation task of our interest while two widely recognized metrics, ROC and precision-recall curve fail the tasks for different reasons."}

The goal of this study is to select a good \"quality\", bounded-size subset of a given set of items, while maintaining their diversity relative to a semi-metric distance function. This problem was first studied by Borodin et al\\cite{borodin}, but a crucial property used throughout their proof is the triangle inequality. In this modified proof, we want to relax the triangle inequality and relate the approximation ratio of max-sum diversification problem to the parameter of the relaxed triangle inequality in the normal form of the problem (i.e., a uniform matroid) and also in an arbitrary matroid."}
{"text": "  Learning a causal effect from observational data is not straightforward, as this is not possible without further assumptions. If hidden common causes between treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$ cannot be blocked by other measurements, one possibility is to use an instrumental variable. In principle, it is possible under some assumptions to discover whether a variable is structurally instrumental to a target causal effect $X \\rightarrow Y$, but current frameworks are somewhat lacking on how general these assumptions can be. A instrumental variable discovery problem is challenging, as no variable can be tested as an instrument in isolation but only in groups, but different variables might require different conditions to be considered an instrument. Moreover, identification constraints might be hard to detect statistically. In this paper, we give a theoretical characterization of instrumental variable discovery, highlighting identifiability problems and solutions, the need for non-Gaussianity assumptions, and how they fit within existing methods."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we investigate whether \"big-data\" is more valuable than \"precise\" data for the problem of energy disaggregation: the process of breaking down aggregate energy usage on a per-appliance basis. Existing techniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1 minute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per month, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new technique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from 'neighbouring' homes to disaggregate energy given only a single energy reading per month. The key intuition behind our approach is that 'similar' homes have 'similar' energy consumption on a per-appliance basis. Neighbourhood NILM matches every home with a set of 'neighbours' that have direct submetering infrastructure, i.e. power meters on individual circuits or loads. Many such homes already exist. Then, it estimates the appliance-level energy consumption of the target home to be the average of its K neighbours. We evaluate this approach using 25 homes and results show that our approach gives comparable or better disaggregation in comparison to state-of-the-art accuracy reported in the literature that depend on manual model training, high frequency power metering, or both. Results show that Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83% and 79% accuracy disaggregating fridge and heating/cooling loads, compared to 74% and 73% for a technique called FHMM. Furthermore, it achieves up to 64% accuracy on washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, and lighting loads, which is higher than previously reported results. Many existing techniques are not able to disaggregate these loads at all. These results indicate a potentially substantial advantage to installing submetering infrastructure in a select few homes rather than installing new high-frequency smart metering infrastructure in all homes."}
{"text": "  Reduced order models are computationally inexpensive approximations that capture the important dynamical characteristics of large, high-fidelity computer models of physical systems. This paper applies machine learning techniques to improve the design of parametric reduced order models. Specifically, machine learning is used to develop feasible regions in the parameter space where the admissible target accuracy is achieved with a predefined reduced order basis, to construct parametric maps, to chose the best two already existing bases for a new parameter configuration from accuracy point of view and to pre-select the optimal dimension of the reduced basis such as to meet the desired accuracy. By combining available information using bases concatenation and interpolation as well as high-fidelity solutions interpolation we are able to build accurate reduced order models associated with new parameter settings. Promising numerical results with a viscous Burgers model illustrate the potential of machine learning approaches to help design better reduced order models."}

Experimental results demonstrate that resulting learning method greatly improves the robustness of the classification models produced."}
{"text": "  We present a new perspective on the popular multi-class algorithmic techniques of one-vs-all and error correcting output codes. Rather than studying the behavior of these techniques for supervised learning, we establish a connection between the success of these methods and the existence of label-efficient learning procedures. We show that in both the realizable and agnostic cases, if output codes are successful at learning from labeled data, they implicitly assume structure on how the classes are related. By making that structure explicit, we design learning algorithms to recover the classes with low label complexity. We provide results for the commonly studied cases of one-vs-all learning and when the codewords of the classes are well separated. We additionally consider the more challenging case where the codewords are not well separated, but satisfy a boundary features condition that captures the natural intuition that every bit of the codewords should be significant."}
{"text": "  Black-box alpha (BB-$\\alpha$) is a new approximate inference method based on the minimization of $\\alpha$-divergences. BB-$\\alpha$ scales to large datasets because it can be implemented using stochastic gradient descent. BB-$\\alpha$ can be applied to complex probabilistic models with little effort since it only requires as input the likelihood function and its gradients. These gradients can be easily obtained using automatic differentiation. By changing the divergence parameter $\\alpha$, the method is able to interpolate between variational Bayes (VB) ($\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$) and an algorithm similar to expectation propagation (EP) ($\\alpha = 1$). Experiments on probit regression and neural network regression and classification problems show that BB-$\\alpha$ with non-standard settings of $\\alpha$, such as $\\alpha = 0.5$, usually produces better predictions than with $\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$ (VB) or $\\alpha = 1$ (EP)."}
{"text": "  A method for large scale Gaussian process classification has been recently proposed based on expectation propagation (EP). Such a method allows Gaussian process classifiers to be trained on very large datasets that were out of the reach of previous deployments of EP and has been shown to be competitive with related techniques based on stochastic variational inference. Nevertheless, the memory resources required scale linearly with the dataset size, unlike in variational methods. This is a severe limitation when the number of instances is very large. Here we show that this problem is avoided when stochastic EP is used to train the model."}
{"text": "  Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations of Gaussian processes (GPs) and are formally equivalent to neural networks with multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are probabilistic and non-parametric and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to generalise, and provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than alternative deep models. The focus of this paper is scalable approximate Bayesian learning of these networks. The paper develops a novel and efficient extension of probabilistic backpropagation, a state-of-the-art method for training Bayesian neural networks, that can be used to train DGPs. The new method leverages a recently proposed method for scaling Expectation Propagation, called stochastic Expectation Propagation. The method is able to automatically discover useful input warping, expansion or compression, and it is therefore is a flexible form of Bayesian kernel design. We demonstrate the success of the new method for supervised learning on several real-world datasets, showing that it typically outperforms GP regression and is never much worse."}
{"text": "  Clinical medical data, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU), consist of multivariate time series of observations. For each patient visit (or episode), sensor data and lab test results are recorded in the patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR). While potentially containing a wealth of insights, the data is difficult to mine effectively, owing to varying length, irregular sampling and missing data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly those using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden units, are powerful and increasingly popular models for learning from sequence data. They effectively model varying length sequences and capture long range dependencies. We present the first study to empirically evaluate the ability of LSTMs to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements. Specifically, we consider multilabel classification of diagnoses, training a model to classify 128 diagnoses given 13 frequently but irregularly sampled clinical measurements. First, we establish the effectiveness of a simple LSTM network for modeling clinical data. Then we demonstrate a straightforward and effective training strategy in which we replicate targets at each sequence step. Trained only on raw time series, our models outperform several strong baselines, including a multilayer perceptron trained on hand-engineered features."}
{"text": "  This paper shows that simply prescribing \"none of the above\" labels to unlabeled data has a beneficial regularization effect to supervised learning. We call it universum prescription by the fact that the prescribed labels cannot be one of the supervised labels. In spite of its simplicity, universum prescription obtained competitive results in training deep convolutional networks for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10 and ImageNet datasets. A qualitative justification of these approaches using Rademacher complexity is presented. The effect of a regularization parameter -- probability of sampling from unlabeled data -- is also studied empirically."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we develop a randomized algorithm and theory for learning a sparse model from large-scale and high-dimensional data, which is usually formulated as an empirical risk minimization problem with a sparsity-inducing regularizer. Under the assumption that there exists a (approximately) sparse solution with high classification accuracy, we argue that the dual solution is also sparse or approximately sparse. The fact that both primal and dual solutions are sparse motivates us to develop a randomized approach for a general convex-concave optimization problem. Specifically, the proposed approach combines the strength of random projection with that of sparse learning: it utilizes random projection to reduce the dimensionality, and introduces $\\ell_1$-norm regularization to alleviate the approximation error caused by random projection. Theoretical analysis shows that under favored conditions, the randomized algorithm can accurately recover the optimal solutions to the convex-concave optimization problem (i.e., recover both the primal and dual solutions)."}
{"text": "  Supervised learning is an active research area, with numerous applications in diverse fields such as data analytics, computer vision, speech and audio processing, and image understanding. In most cases, the loss functions used in machine learning assume symmetric noise models, and seek to estimate the unknown function parameters. However, loss functions such as quantile and quantile Huber generalize the symmetric $\\ell_1$ and Huber losses to the asymmetric setting, for a fixed quantile parameter. In this paper, we propose to jointly infer the quantile parameter and the unknown function parameters, for the asymmetric quantile Huber and quantile losses. We explore various properties of the quantile Huber loss and implement a convexity certificate that can be used to check convexity in the quantile parameter. When the loss if convex with respect to the parameter of the function, we prove that it is biconvex in both the function and the quantile parameters, and propose an algorithm to jointly estimate these. Results with synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically recover the quantile parameter corresponding to the noise and also provide an improved recovery of function parameters. To illustrate the potential of the framework, we extend the gradient boosting machines with quantile losses to automatically estimate the quantile parameter at each iteration."}
{"text": "  For regular particle filter algorithm or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, the initial weights are traditionally dependent on the proposed distribution, the posterior distribution at the current timestamp in the sampled sequence, and the target is the posterior distribution of the previous timestamp. This is technically correct, but leads to algorithms which usually have practical issues with degeneracy, where all particles eventually collapse onto a single particle. In this paper, we propose and evaluate using $k$ means clustering to attack and even take advantage of this degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a Stochastic SMC algorithm which initializes the set of $k$ means, providing the initial centers chosen from the collapsed particles. To fight against degeneracy, we adjust the regular SMC weights, mediated by cluster proportions, and then correct them to retain the same expectation as before. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach has better performance than vanilla algorithms."}
{"text": "  We compute approximate solutions to L0 regularized linear regression using L1 regularization, also known as the Lasso, as an initialization step. Our algorithm, the Lass-0 (\"Lass-zero\"), uses a computationally efficient stepwise search to determine a locally optimal L0 solution given any L1 regularization solution. We present theoretical results of consistency under orthogonality and appropriate handling of redundant features. Empirically, we use synthetic data to demonstrate that Lass-0 solutions are closer to the true sparse support than L1 regularization models. Additionally, in real-world data Lass-0 finds more parsimonious solutions than L1 regularization while maintaining similar predictive accuracy."}
{"text": "  We present a scalable Gaussian process model for identifying and characterizing smooth multidimensional changepoints, and automatically learning changes in expressive covariance structure. We use Random Kitchen Sink features to flexibly define a change surface in combination with expressive spectral mixture kernels to capture the complex statistical structure. Finally, through the use of novel methods for additive non-separable kernels, we can scale the model to large datasets. We demonstrate the model on numerical and real world data, including a large spatio-temporal disease dataset where we identify previously unknown heterogeneous changes in space and time."}
{"text": "  We introduce Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis (DeepLDA) which learns linearly separable latent representations in an end-to-end fashion. Classic LDA extracts features which preserve class separability and is used for dimensionality reduction for many classification problems. The central idea of this paper is to put LDA on top of a deep neural network. This can be seen as a non-linear extension of classic LDA. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual samples, we propose an objective function that pushes the network to produce feature distributions which: (a) have low variance within the same class and (b) high variance between different classes. Our objective is derived from the general LDA eigenvalue problem and still allows to train with stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation. For evaluation we test our approach on three different benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and STL-10). DeepLDA produces competitive results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 and outperforms a network trained with categorical cross entropy (same architecture) on a supervised setting of STL-10."}
{"text": "  Kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) is a nonlinear multi-view representation learning technique with broad applicability in statistics and machine learning. Although there is a closed-form solution for the KCCA objective, it involves solving an $N\\times N$ eigenvalue system where $N$ is the training set size, making its computational requirements in both memory and time prohibitive for large-scale problems. Various approximation techniques have been developed for KCCA. A commonly used approach is to first transform the original inputs to an $M$-dimensional random feature space so that inner products in the feature space approximate kernel evaluations, and then apply linear CCA to the transformed inputs. In many applications, however, the dimensionality $M$ of the random feature space may need to be very large in order to obtain a sufficiently good approximation; it then becomes challenging to perform the linear CCA step on the resulting very high-dimensional data matrices. We show how to use a stochastic optimization algorithm, recently proposed for linear CCA and its neural-network extension, to further alleviate the computation requirements of approximate KCCA. This approach allows us to run approximate KCCA on a speech dataset with $1.4$ million training samples and a random feature space of dimensionality $M=100000$ on a typical workstation."}
{"text": "  Online learning with multiple kernels has gained increasing interests in recent years and found many applications. For classification tasks, Online Multiple Kernel Classification (OMKC), which learns a kernel based classifier by seeking the optimal linear combination of a pool of single kernel classifiers in an online fashion, achieves superior accuracy and enjoys great flexibility compared with traditional single-kernel classifiers. Despite being studied extensively, existing OMKC algorithms suffer from high computational cost due to their unbounded numbers of support vectors. To overcome this drawback, we present a novel framework of Budget Online Multiple Kernel Learning (BOMKL) and propose a new Sparse Passive Aggressive learning to perform effective budget online learning. Specifically, we adopt a simple yet effective Bernoulli sampling to decide if an incoming instance should be added to the current set of support vectors. By limiting the number of support vectors, our method can significantly accelerate OMKC while maintaining satisfactory accuracy that is comparable to that of the existing OMKC algorithms. We theoretically prove that our new method achieves an optimal regret bound in expectation, and empirically found that the proposed algorithm outperforms various OMKC algorithms and can easily scale up to large-scale datasets."}
{"text": "  We present a convex approach to probabilistic segmentation and modeling of time series data. Our approach builds upon recent advances in multivariate total variation regularization, and seeks to learn a separate set of parameters for the distribution over the observations at each time point, but with an additional penalty that encourages the parameters to remain constant over time. We propose efficient optimization methods for solving the resulting (large) optimization problems, and a two-stage procedure for estimating recurring clusters under such models, based upon kernel density estimation. Finally, we show on a number of real-world segmentation tasks, the resulting methods often perform as well or better than existing latent variable models, while being substantially easier to train."}
{"text": "  The field of Movement Ecology, like so many other fields, is experiencing a period of rapid growth in availability of data. As the volume rises, traditional methods are giving way to machine learning and data science, which are playing an increasingly large part it turning this data into science-driving insights. One rich and interesting source is the bio-logger. These small electronic wearable devices are attached to animals free to roam in their natural habitats, and report back readings from multiple sensors, including GPS and accelerometer bursts. A common use of accelerometer data is for supervised learning of behavioral modes. However, we need unsupervised analysis tools as well, in order to overcome the inherent difficulties of obtaining a labeled dataset, which in some cases is either infeasible or does not successfully encompass the full repertoire of behavioral modes of interest. Here we present a matrix factorization based topic-model method for accelerometer bursts, derived using a linear mixture property of patch features. Our method is validated via comparison to a labeled dataset, and is further compared to standard clustering algorithms."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks are powerful parametric models that can be trained efficiently using the backpropagation algorithm. Stochastic neural networks combine the power of large parametric functions with that of graphical models, which makes it possible to learn very complex distributions. However, as backpropagation is not directly applicable to stochastic networks that include discrete sampling operations within their computational graph, training such networks remains difficult. We present MuProp, an unbiased gradient estimator for stochastic networks, designed to make this task easier. MuProp improves on the likelihood-ratio estimator by reducing its variance using a control variate based on the first-order Taylor expansion of a mean-field network. Crucially, unlike prior attempts at using backpropagation for training stochastic networks, the resulting estimator is unbiased and well behaved. Our experiments on structured output prediction and discrete latent variable modeling demonstrate that MuProp yields consistently good performance across a range of difficult tasks."}
{"text": "  We consider the hashing mechanism for constructing binary embeddings, that involves pseudo-random projections followed by nonlinear (sign function) mappings. The pseudo-random projection is described by a matrix, where not all entries are independent random variables but instead a fixed \"budget of randomness\" is distributed across the matrix. Such matrices can be efficiently stored in sub-quadratic or even linear space, provide reduction in randomness usage (i.e. number of required random values), and very often lead to computational speed ups. We prove several theoretical results showing that projections via various structured matrices followed by nonlinear mappings accurately preserve the angular distance between input high-dimensional vectors. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first that give theoretical ground for the use of general structured matrices in the nonlinear setting. In particular, they generalize previous extensions of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and prove the plausibility of the approach that was so far only heuristically confirmed for some special structured matrices. Consequently, we show that many structured matrices can be used as an efficient information compression mechanism. Our findings build a better understanding of certain deep architectures, which contain randomly weighted and untrained layers, and yet achieve high performance on different learning tasks. We empirically verify our theoretical findings and show the dependence of learning via structured hashed projections on the performance of neural network as well as nearest neighbor classifier."}
{"text": "  A new algorithm named EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE) was recently proposed to solve the problem of large-scale anomaly detection. It is a non-parametric and distribution free kernel method based on the Hilbert space embedding of probability measures. Given a dataset of $n$ samples, EXPoSE needs only $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ (linear time) to build a model and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ (constant time) to make a prediction. In this work we improve the linear computational complexity and show that an $\\epsilon$-accurate model can be estimated in constant time, which has significant implications for large-scale learning problems. To achieve this goal, we cast the original EXPoSE formulation into a stochastic optimization problem. It is crucial that this approach allows us to determine the number of iteration based on a desired accuracy $\\epsilon$, independent of the dataset size $n$. We will show that the proposed stochastic gradient descent algorithm works in general (possible infinite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces, is easy to implement and requires no additional step-size parameters."}
{"text": "  We present PESMO, a Bayesian method for identifying the Pareto set of multi-objective optimization problems, when the functions are expensive to evaluate. The central idea of PESMO is to choose evaluation points so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the posterior distribution over the Pareto set. Critically, the PESMO multi-objective acquisition function can be decomposed as a sum of objective-specific acquisition functions, which enables the algorithm to be used in \\emph{decoupled} scenarios in which the objectives can be evaluated separately and perhaps with different costs. This decoupling capability also makes it possible to identify difficult objectives that require more evaluations. PESMO also offers gains in efficiency, as its cost scales linearly with the number of objectives, in comparison to the exponential cost of other methods. We compare PESMO with other related methods for multi-objective Bayesian optimization on synthetic and real-world problems. The results show that PESMO produces better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations of the objectives, and that a decoupled evaluation can lead to improvements in performance, particularly when the number of objectives is large."}
{"text": "  We introduce techniques for rapidly transferring the information stored in one neural net into another neural net. The main purpose is to accelerate the training of a significantly larger neural net. During real-world workflows, one often trains very many different neural networks during the experimentation and design process. This is a wasteful process in which each new model is trained from scratch. Our Net2Net technique accelerates the experimentation process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previous network to each new deeper or wider network. Our techniques are based on the concept of function-preserving transformations between neural network specifications. This differs from previous approaches to pre-training that altered the function represented by a neural net when adding layers to it. Using our knowledge transfer mechanism to add depth to Inception modules, we demonstrate a new state of the art accuracy rating on the ImageNet dataset."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose the \"adversarial autoencoder\" (AAE), which is a probabilistic autoencoder that uses the recently proposed generative adversarial networks (GAN) to perform variational inference by matching the aggregated posterior of the hidden code vector of the autoencoder with an arbitrary prior distribution. Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the adversarial autoencoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution. We show how the adversarial autoencoder can be used in applications such as semi-supervised classification, disentangling style and content of images, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization. We performed experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets and show that adversarial autoencoders achieve competitive results in generative modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks."}
{"text": "  Generative models for deep learning are promising both to improve understanding of the model, and yield training methods requiring fewer labeled samples.   Recent works use generative model approaches to produce the deep net's input given the value of a hidden layer several levels above. However, there is no accompanying \"proof of correctness\" for the generative model, showing that the feedforward deep net is the correct inference method for recovering the hidden layer given the input. Furthermore, these models are complicated.   The current paper takes a more theoretical tack. It presents a very simple generative model for RELU deep nets, with the following characteristics: (i) The generative model is just the reverse of the feedforward net: if the forward transformation at a layer is $A$ then the reverse transformation is $A^T$. (This can be seen as an explanation of the old weight tying idea for denoising autoencoders.) (ii) Its correctness can be proven under a clean theoretical assumption: the edge weights in real-life deep nets behave like random numbers. Under this assumption ---which is experimentally tested on real-life nets like AlexNet--- it is formally proved that feed forward net is a correct inference method for recovering the hidden layer.   The generative model suggests a simple modification for training: use the generative model to produce synthetic data with labels and include it in the training set. Experiments are shown to support this theory of random-like deep nets; and that it helps the training."}
{"text": "  Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) have been shown to ameliorate the vanishing gradient problem, allow for efficient backpropagation, and empirically promote sparsity in the learned parameters. They have led to state-of-the-art results in a variety of applications. However, unlike threshold and sigmoid networks, ReLU networks are less explored from the perspective of their expressiveness. This paper studies the expressiveness of ReLU networks. We characterize the decision boundary of two-layer ReLU networks by constructing functionally equivalent threshold networks. We show that while the decision boundary of a two-layer ReLU network can be captured by a threshold network, the latter may require an exponentially larger number of hidden units. We also formulate sufficient conditions for a corresponding logarithmic reduction in the number of hidden units to represent a sign network as a ReLU network. Finally, we experimentally compare threshold networks and their much smaller ReLU counterparts with respect to their ability to learn from synthetically generated data."}
{"text": "  Proposed methods for prediction interval estimation so far focus on cases where input variables are numerical. In datasets with solely nominal input variables, we observe records with the exact same input $x^u$, but different real valued outputs due to the inherent noise in the system. Existing prediction interval estimation methods do not use representations that can accurately model such inherent noise in the case of nominal inputs. We propose a new prediction interval estimation method tailored for this type of data, which is prevalent in biology and medicine. We call this method Distribution Adaptive Prediction Interval Estimation given Nominal inputs (DAPIEN) and has four main phases. First, we select a distribution function that can best represent the inherent noise of the system for all unique inputs. Then we infer the parameters $\\theta_i$ (e.g. $\\theta_i=[mean_i, variance_i]$) of the selected distribution function for all unique input vectors $x^u_i$ and generate a new corresponding training set using pairs of $x^u_i, \\theta_i$. III). Then, we train a model to predict $\\theta$ given a new $x_u$. Finally, we calculate the prediction interval for a new sample using the inverse of the cumulative distribution function once the parameters $\\theta$ is predicted by the trained model. We compared DAPIEN to the commonly used Bootstrap method on three synthetic datasets. Our results show that DAPIEN provides tighter prediction intervals while preserving the requested coverage when compared to Bootstrap. This work can facilitate broader usage of regression methods in medicine and biology where it is necessary to provide tight prediction intervals while preserving coverage when input variables are nominal."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian solution for nonlinear regression in complex fields. Previous solutions for kernels methods usually assume a complexification approach, where the real-valued kernel is replaced by a complex-valued one. This approach is limited. Based on results in complex-valued linear theory and Gaussian random processes we show that a pseudo-kernel must be included. This is the starting point to develop the new complex-valued formulation for Gaussian process for regression (CGPR). We face the design of the covariance and pseudo-covariance based on a convolution approach and for several scenarios. Just in the particular case where the outputs are proper, the pseudo-kernel cancels. Also, the hyperparameters of the covariance {can be learnt} maximizing the marginal likelihood using Wirtinger's calculus and patterned complex-valued matrix derivatives. In the experiments included, we show how CGPR successfully solve systems where real and imaginary parts are correlated. Besides, we successfully solve the nonlinear channel equalization problem by developing a recursive solution with basis removal. We report remarkable improvements compared to previous solutions: a 2-4 dB reduction of the MSE with {just a quarter} of the training samples used by previous approaches."}
{"text": "  Traditional machine learning methods usually minimize a simple loss function to learn a predictive model, and then use a complex performance measure to measure the prediction performance. However, minimizing a simple loss function cannot guarantee that an optimal performance. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the complex performance measure directly to obtain a predictive model. We proposed to construct a maximum likelihood model for this problem, and to learn the model parameter, we minimize a com- plex loss function corresponding to the desired complex performance measure. To optimize the loss function, we approximate the upper bound of the complex loss. We also propose impose the sparsity to the model parameter to obtain a sparse model. An objective is constructed by combining the upper bound of the loss function and the sparsity of the model parameter, and we develop an iterative algorithm to minimize it by using the fast iterative shrinkage- thresholding algorithm framework. The experiments on optimization on three different complex performance measures, including F-score, receiver operating characteristic curve, and recall precision curve break even point, over three real-world applications, aircraft event recognition of civil aviation safety, in- trusion detection in wireless mesh networks, and image classification, show the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  The efficiency of graph-based semi-supervised algorithms depends on the graph of instances on which they are applied. The instances are often in a vectorial form before a graph linking them is built. The construction of the graph relies on a metric over the vectorial space that help define the weight of the connection between entities. The classic choice for this metric is usually a distance measure or a similarity measure based on the euclidean norm. We claim that in some cases the euclidean norm on the initial vectorial space might not be the more appropriate to solve the task efficiently. We propose an algorithm that aims at learning the most appropriate vectorial representation for building a graph on which the task at hand is solved efficiently."}
{"text": "  K-means is one of the most widely used algorithms for clustering in Data Mining applications, which attempts to minimize the sum of the square of the Euclidean distance of the points in the clusters from the respective means of the clusters. However, K-means suffers from local minima problem and is not guaranteed to converge to the optimal cost. K-means++ tries to address the problem by seeding the means using a distance-based sampling scheme. However, seeding the means in K-means++ needs $O\\left(K\\right)$ sequential passes through the entire dataset, and this can be very costly for large datasets. Here we propose a method of seeding the initial means based on factorizations of higher order moments for bounded data. Our method takes $O\\left(1\\right)$ passes through the entire dataset to extract the initial set of means, and its final cost can be proven to be within $O(\\sqrt{K})$ of the optimal cost. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in comparison with the existing algorithms on various benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  Leveraging large historical data in electronic health record (EHR), we developed Doctor AI, a generic predictive model that covers observed medical conditions and medication uses. Doctor AI is a temporal model using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and was developed and applied to longitudinal time stamped EHR data from 260K patients over 8 years. Encounter records (e.g. diagnosis codes, medication codes or procedure codes) were input to RNN to predict (all) the diagnosis and medication categories for a subsequent visit. Doctor AI assesses the history of patients to make multilabel predictions (one label for each diagnosis or medication category). Based on separate blind test set evaluation, Doctor AI can perform differential diagnosis with up to 79% recall@30, significantly higher than several baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate great generalizability of Doctor AI by adapting the resulting models from one institution to another without losing substantial accuracy."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several machine learning tasks. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the preferred optimization algorithm for training these networks and asynchronous SGD (ASGD) has been widely adopted for accelerating the training of large-scale deep networks in a distributed computing environment. However, in practice it is quite challenging to tune the training hyperparameters (such as learning rate) when using ASGD so as achieve convergence and linear speedup, since the stability of the optimization algorithm is strongly influenced by the asynchronous nature of parameter updates. In this paper, we propose a variant of the ASGD algorithm in which the learning rate is modulated according to the gradient staleness and provide theoretical guarantees for convergence of this algorithm. Experimental verification is performed on commonly-used image classification benchmarks: CIFAR10 and Imagenet to demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared to SSGD (Synchronous SGD) and the conventional ASGD algorithm."}
{"text": "  Experience replay lets online reinforcement learning agents remember and reuse experiences from the past. In prior work, experience transitions were uniformly sampled from a replay memory. However, this approach simply replays transitions at the same frequency that they were originally experienced, regardless of their significance. In this paper we develop a framework for prioritizing experience, so as to replay important transitions more frequently, and therefore learn more efficiently. We use prioritized experience replay in Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm that achieved human-level performance across many Atari games. DQN with prioritized experience replay achieves a new state-of-the-art, outperforming DQN with uniform replay on 41 out of 49 games."}
{"text": "  In clinical and neuroscientific studies, systematic differences between two populations of brain networks are investigated in order to characterize mental diseases or processes. Those networks are usually represented as graphs built from neuroimaging data and studied by means of graph analysis methods. The typical machine learning approach to study these brain graphs creates a classifier and tests its ability to discriminate the two populations. In contrast to this approach, in this work we propose to directly test whether two populations of graphs are different or not, by using the kernel two-sample test (KTST), without creating the intermediate classifier. We claim that, in general, the two approaches provides similar results and that the KTST requires much less computation. Additionally, in the regime of low sample size, we claim that the KTST has lower frequency of Type II error than the classification approach. Besides providing algorithmic considerations to support these claims, we show strong evidence through experiments and one simulation."}
{"text": "  Joint modeling of language and vision has been drawing increasing interest. A multimodal data representation allowing for bidirectional retrieval of images by sentences and vice versa is a key aspect. In this paper we present three contributions in canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based multimodal retrieval. Firstly, we show that an asymmetric weighting of the canonical weights, while achieving a cross view mapping from the search to the query space, improves the retrieval performance. Secondly, we devise a computationally efficient model selection, crucial to generalization and stability, in the framework of the Bj\\\"ork Golub algorithm for regularized CCA via spectral filtering. Finally, we introduce a Hierarchical Kernel Sentence Embedding (HKSE) that approximates Kernel CCA for a special similarity kernel between distribution of words embedded in a vector space. State of the art results are obtained on MSCOCO and Flickr benchmarks when these three techniques are used in conjunction."}
{"text": "  Policies for complex visual tasks have been successfully learned with deep reinforcement learning, using an approach called deep Q-networks (DQN), but relatively large (task-specific) networks and extensive training are needed to achieve good performance. In this work, we present a novel method called policy distillation that can be used to extract the policy of a reinforcement learning agent and train a new network that performs at the expert level while being dramatically smaller and more efficient. Furthermore, the same method can be used to consolidate multiple task-specific policies into a single policy. We demonstrate these claims using the Atari domain and show that the multi-task distilled agent outperforms the single-task teachers as well as a jointly-trained DQN agent."}
{"text": "  Deep learning has become the state-of-art tool in many applications, but the evaluation and training of deep models can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. The conditional computation approach has been proposed to tackle this problem (Bengio et al., 2013; Davis & Arel, 2013). It operates by selectively activating only parts of the network at a time. In this paper, we use reinforcement learning as a tool to optimize conditional computation policies. More specifically, we cast the problem of learning activation-dependent policies for dropping out blocks of units as a reinforcement learning problem. We propose a learning scheme motivated by computation speed, capturing the idea of wanting to have parsimonious activations while maintaining prediction accuracy. We apply a policy gradient algorithm for learning policies that optimize this loss function and propose a regularization mechanism that encourages diversification of the dropout policy. We present encouraging empirical results showing that this approach improves the speed of computation without impacting the quality of the approximation."}
{"text": "  Unregularized deep neural networks (DNNs) can be easily overfit with a limited sample size. We argue that this is mostly due to the disriminative nature of DNNs which directly model the conditional probability (or score) of labels given the input. The ignorance of input distribution makes DNNs difficult to generalize to unseen data. Recent advances in regularization techniques, such as pretraining and dropout, indicate that modeling input data distribution (either explicitly or implicitly) greatly improves the generalization ability of a DNN. In this work, we explore the manifold hypothesis which assumes that instances within the same class lie in a smooth manifold. We accordingly propose two simple regularizers to a standard discriminative DNN. The first one, named Label-Aware Manifold Regularization, assumes the availability of labels and penalizes large norms of the loss function w.r.t. data points. The second one, named Label-Independent Manifold Regularization, does not use label information and instead penalizes the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of prediction scores w.r.t. data points, which makes semi-supervised learning possible. We perform extensive control experiments on fully supervised and semi-supervised tasks using the MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets and achieve excellent results."}
{"text": "  The sparsity of signals in a transform domain or dictionary has been exploited in applications such as compression, denoising and inverse problems. More recently, data-driven adaptation of synthesis dictionaries has shown promise compared to analytical dictionary models. However, dictionary learning problems are typically non-convex and NP-hard, and the usual alternating minimization approaches for these problems are often computationally expensive, with the computations dominated by the NP-hard synthesis sparse coding step. This paper exploits the ideas that drive algorithms such as K-SVD, and investigates in detail efficient methods for aggregate sparsity penalized dictionary learning by first approximating the data with a sum of sparse rank-one matrices (outer products) and then using a block coordinate descent approach to estimate the unknowns. The resulting block coordinate descent algorithms involve efficient closed-form solutions. Furthermore, we consider the problem of dictionary-blind image reconstruction, and propose novel and efficient algorithms for adaptive image reconstruction using block coordinate descent and sum of outer products methodologies. We provide a convergence study of the algorithms for dictionary learning and dictionary-blind image reconstruction. Our numerical experiments show the promising performance and speed-ups provided by the proposed methods over previous schemes in sparse data representation and compressed sensing-based image reconstruction."}
{"text": "  The ability to act in multiple environments and transfer previous knowledge to new situations can be considered a critical aspect of any intelligent agent. Towards this goal, we define a novel method of multitask and transfer learning that enables an autonomous agent to learn how to behave in multiple tasks simultaneously, and then generalize its knowledge to new domains. This method, termed \"Actor-Mimic\", exploits the use of deep reinforcement learning and model compression techniques to train a single policy network that learns how to act in a set of distinct tasks by using the guidance of several expert teachers. We then show that the representations learnt by the deep policy network are capable of generalizing to new tasks with no prior expert guidance, speeding up learning in novel environments. Although our method can in general be applied to a wide range of problems, we use Atari games as a testing environment to demonstrate these methods."}
{"text": "  In recent years increasingly complex architectures for deep convolution networks (DCNs) have been proposed to boost the performance on image recognition tasks. However, the gains in performance have come at a cost of substantial increase in computation and model storage resources. Fixed point implementation of DCNs has the potential to alleviate some of these complexities and facilitate potential deployment on embedded hardware. In this paper, we propose a quantizer design for fixed point implementation of DCNs. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to identify optimal fixed point bit-width allocation across DCN layers. Our experiments show that in comparison to equal bit-width settings, the fixed point DCNs with optimized bit width allocation offer >20% reduction in the model size without any loss in accuracy on CIFAR-10 benchmark. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning can further enhance the accuracy of fixed point DCNs beyond that of the original floating point model. In doing so, we report a new state-of-the-art fixed point performance of 6.78% error-rate on CIFAR-10 benchmark."}
{"text": "  Denoising autoencoders (DAE) are trained to reconstruct their clean inputs with noise injected at the input level, while variational autoencoders (VAE) are trained with noise injected in their stochastic hidden layer, with a regularizer that encourages this noise injection. In this paper, we show that injecting noise both in input and in the stochastic hidden layer can be advantageous and we propose a modified variational lower bound as an improved objective function in this setup. When input is corrupted, then the standard VAE lower bound involves marginalizing the encoder conditional distribution over the input noise, which makes the training criterion intractable. Instead, we propose a modified training criterion which corresponds to a tractable bound when input is corrupted. Experimentally, we find that the proposed denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) yields better average log-likelihood than the VAE and the importance weighted autoencoder on the MNIST and Frey Face datasets."}
{"text": "  Supervised training of deep neural nets typically relies on minimizing cross-entropy. However, in many domains, we are interested in performing well on metrics specific to the application. In this paper we propose a direct loss minimization approach to train deep neural networks, which provably minimizes the application-specific loss function. This is often non-trivial, since these functions are neither smooth nor decomposable and thus are not amenable to optimization with standard gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of maximizing average precision for ranking problems. Towards this goal, we develop a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can efficiently compute the weight updates. Our approach proves superior to a variety of baselines in the context of action classification and object detection, especially in the presence of label noise."}
{"text": "  Layer-sequential unit-variance (LSUV) initialization - a simple method for weight initialization for deep net learning - is proposed. The method consists of the two steps. First, pre-initialize weights of each convolution or inner-product layer with orthonormal matrices. Second, proceed from the first to the final layer, normalizing the variance of the output of each layer to be equal to one.   Experiment with different activation functions (maxout, ReLU-family, tanh) show that the proposed initialization leads to learning of very deep nets that (i) produces networks with test accuracy better or equal to standard methods and (ii) is at least as fast as the complex schemes proposed specifically for very deep nets such as FitNets (Romero et al. (2015)) and Highway (Srivastava et al. (2015)).   Performance is evaluated on GoogLeNet, CaffeNet, FitNets and Residual nets and the state-of-the-art, or very close to it, is achieved on the MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets."}
{"text": "  The Manual labeling of data is and will remain a costly endeavor. For this reason, semi-supervised learning remains a topic of practical importance. The recently proposed Ladder Network is one such approach that has proven to be very successful. In addition to the supervised objective, the Ladder Network also adds an unsupervised objective corresponding to the reconstruction costs of a stack of denoising autoencoders. Although the empirical results are impressive, the Ladder Network has many components intertwined, whose contributions are not obvious in such a complex architecture. In order to help elucidate and disentangle the different ingredients in the Ladder Network recipe, this paper presents an extensive experimental investigation of variants of the Ladder Network in which we replace or remove individual components to gain more insight into their relative importance. We find that all of the components are necessary for achieving optimal performance, but they do not contribute equally. For semi-supervised tasks, we conclude that the most important contribution is made by the lateral connection, followed by the application of noise, and finally the choice of what we refer to as the `combinator function' in the decoder path. We also find that as the number of labeled training examples increases, the lateral connections and reconstruction criterion become less important, with most of the improvement in generalization being due to the injection of noise in each layer. Furthermore, we present a new type of combinator function that outperforms the original design in both fully- and semi-supervised tasks, reducing record test error rates on Permutation-Invariant MNIST to 0.57% for the supervised setting, and to 0.97% and 1.0% for semi-supervised settings with 1000 and 100 labeled examples respectively."}
{"text": "  We consider whether deep convolutional networks (CNNs) can represent decision functions with similar accuracy as recurrent networks such as LSTMs. First, we show that a deep CNN with an architecture inspired by the models recently introduced in image recognition can yield better accuracy than previous convolutional and LSTM networks on the standard 309h Switchboard automatic speech recognition task. Then we show that even more accurate CNNs can be trained under the guidance of LSTMs using a variant of model compression, which we call model blending because the teacher and student models are similar in complexity but different in inductive bias. Blending further improves the accuracy of our CNN, yielding a computationally efficient model of accuracy higher than any of the other individual models. Examining the effect of \"dark knowledge\" in this model compression task, we find that less than 1% of the highest probability labels are needed for accurate model compression."}
{"text": "  Deep learning methods have resulted in significant performance improvements in several application domains and as such several software frameworks have been developed to facilitate their implementation. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning frameworks, namely Caffe, Neon, TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch, on three aspects: extensibility, hardware utilization, and speed. The study is performed on several types of deep learning architectures and we evaluate the performance of the above frameworks when employed on a single machine for both (multi-threaded) CPU and GPU (Nvidia Titan X) settings. The speed performance metrics used here include the gradient computation time, which is important during the training phase of deep networks, and the forward time, which is important from the deployment perspective of trained networks. For convolutional networks, we also report how each of these frameworks support various convolutional algorithms and their corresponding performance. From our experiments, we observe that Theano and Torch are the most easily extensible frameworks. We observe that Torch is best suited for any deep architecture on CPU, followed by Theano. It also achieves the best performance on the GPU for large convolutional and fully connected networks, followed closely by Neon. Theano achieves the best performance on GPU for training and deployment of LSTM networks. Caffe is the easiest for evaluating the performance of standard deep architectures. Finally, TensorFlow is a very flexible framework, similar to Theano, but its performance is currently not competitive compared to the other studied frameworks."}
{"text": "  General unsupervised learning is a long-standing conceptual problem in machine learning. Supervised learning is successful because it can be solved by the minimization of the training error cost function. Unsupervised learning is not as successful, because the unsupervised objective may be unrelated to the supervised task of interest. For an example, density modelling and reconstruction have often been used for unsupervised learning, but they did not produced the sought-after performance gains, because they have no knowledge of the supervised tasks.   In this paper, we present an unsupervised cost function which we name the Output Distribution Matching (ODM) cost, which measures a divergence between the distribution of predictions and distributions of labels. The ODM cost is appealing because it is consistent with the supervised cost in the following sense: a perfect supervised classifier is also perfect according to the ODM cost. Therefore, by aggressively optimizing the ODM cost, we are almost guaranteed to improve our supervised performance whenever the space of possible predictions is exponentially large.   We demonstrate that the ODM cost works well on number of small and semi-artificial datasets using no (or almost no) labelled training cases. Finally, we show that the ODM cost can be used for one-shot domain adaptation, which allows the model to classify inputs that differ from the input distribution in significant ways without the need for prior exposure to the new domain."}
{"text": "  Often, the performance on a supervised machine learning task is evaluated with a emph{task loss} function that cannot be optimized directly. Examples of such loss functions include the classification error, the edit distance and the BLEU score. A common workaround for this problem is to instead optimize a emph{surrogate loss} function, such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge loss. In order for this remedy to be effective, it is important to ensure that minimization of the surrogate loss results in minimization of the task loss, a condition that we call emph{consistency with the task loss}. In this work, we propose another method for deriving differentiable surrogate losses that provably meet this requirement. We focus on the broad class of models that define a score for every input-output pair. Our idea is that this score can be interpreted as an estimate of the task loss, and that the estimation error may be used as a consistent surrogate loss. A distinct feature of such an approach is that it defines the desirable value of the score for every input-output pair. We use this property to design specialized surrogate losses for Encoder-Decoder models often used for sequence prediction tasks. In our experiment, we benchmark on the task of speech recognition. Using a new surrogate loss instead of cross-entropy to train an Encoder-Decoder speech recognizer brings a significant ~13% relative improvement in terms of Character Error Rate (CER) in the case when no extra corpora are used for language modeling."}
{"text": "  We introduce \"AnnealSGD\", a regularized stochastic gradient descent algorithm motivated by an analysis of the energy landscape of a particular class of deep networks with sparse random weights. The loss function of such networks can be approximated by the Hamiltonian of a spherical spin glass with Gaussian coupling. While different from currently-popular architectures such as convolutional ones, spin glasses are amenable to analysis, which provides insights on the topology of the loss function and motivates algorithms to minimize it. Specifically, we show that a regularization term akin to a magnetic field can be modulated with a single scalar parameter to transition the loss function from a complex, non-convex landscape with exponentially many local minima, to a phase with a polynomial number of minima, all the way down to a trivial landscape with a unique minimum. AnnealSGD starts training in the relaxed polynomial regime and gradually tightens the regularization parameter to steer the energy towards the original exponential regime. Even for convolutional neural networks, which are quite unlike sparse random networks, we empirically show that AnnealSGD improves the generalization error using competitive baselines on MNIST and CIFAR-10."}
{"text": "  In recent years there have been many successes of using deep representations in reinforcement learning. Still, many of these applications use conventional architectures, such as convolutional networks, LSTMs, or auto-encoders. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture for model-free reinforcement learning. Our dueling network represents two separate estimators: one for the state value function and one for the state-dependent action advantage function. The main benefit of this factoring is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this architecture leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions. Moreover, the dueling architecture enables our RL agent to outperform the state-of-the-art on the Atari 2600 domain."}
{"text": "  We propose `Dracula', a new framework for unsupervised feature selection from sequential data such as text. Dracula learns a dictionary of $n$-grams that efficiently compresses a given corpus and recursively compresses its own dictionary; in effect, Dracula is a `deep' extension of Compressive Feature Learning. It requires solving a binary linear program that may be relaxed to a linear program. Both problems exhibit considerable structure, their solution paths are well behaved, and we identify parameters which control the depth and diversity of the dictionary. We also discuss how to derive features from the compressed documents and show that while certain unregularized linear models are invariant to the structure of the compressed dictionary, this structure may be used to regularize learning. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of Dracula's features."}
{"text": "  Mobile phone metadata is increasingly used for humanitarian purposes in developing countries as traditional data is scarce. Basic demographic information is however often absent from mobile phone datasets, limiting the operational impact of the datasets. For these reasons, there has been a growing interest in predicting demographic information from mobile phone metadata. Previous work focused on creating increasingly advanced features to be modeled with standard machine learning algorithms. We here instead model the raw mobile phone metadata directly using deep learning, exploiting the temporal nature of the patterns in the data. From high-level assumptions we design a data representation and convolutional network architecture for modeling patterns within a week. We then examine three strategies for aggregating patterns across weeks and show that our method reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on both age and gender prediction using only the temporal modality in mobile metadata. We finally validate our method on low activity users and evaluate the modeling assumptions."}
{"text": "  Hyperparameter selection generally relies on running multiple full training trials, with selection based on validation set performance. We propose a gradient-based approach for locally adjusting hyperparameters during training of the model. Hyperparameters are adjusted so as to make the model parameter gradients, and hence updates, more advantageous for the validation cost. We explore the approach for tuning regularization hyperparameters and find that in experiments on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, the resulting regularization levels are within the optimal regions. The additional computational cost depends on how frequently the hyperparameters are trained, but the tested scheme adds only 30% computational overhead regardless of the model size. Since the method is significantly less computationally demanding compared to similar gradient-based approaches to hyperparameter optimization, and consistently finds good hyperparameter values, it can be a useful tool for training neural network models."}

{"text": "  In some speaker recognition scenarios we find conversations recorded simultaneously over multiple channels. That is the case of the interviews in the NIST SRE dataset. To take advantage of that, we propose a modification of the PLDA model that considers two different inter-session variability terms. The first term is tied between all the recordings belonging to the same conversation whereas the second is not. Thus, the former mainly intends to capture the variability due to the phonetic content of the conversation while the latter tries to capture the channel variability. In this document, we derive the equations for this model. This model was applied in the paper \"Handling Recordings Acquired Simultaneously over Multiple Channels with PLDA\" published at Interspeech 2013."}

Theoretical motivations and algorithms for joint learning for each are presented. We apply the new models to the domain of data-streams in work towards life-long learning. The proposed architectures show improved performance compared to a pseudo-labeled, drop-out rectifier network."}
{"text": "  A two--step Christoffel function based solution is proposed to distribution regression problem. On the first step, to model distribution of observations inside a bag, build Christoffel function for each bag of observations. Then, on the second step, build outcome variable Christoffel function, but use the bag's Christoffel function value at given point as the weight for the bag's outcome. The approach allows the result to be obtained in closed form and then to be evaluated numerically. While most of existing approaches minimize some kind an error between outcome and prediction, the proposed approach is conceptually different, because it uses Christoffel function for knowledge representation, what is conceptually equivalent working with probabilities only. To receive possible outcomes and their probabilities Gauss quadrature for second--step measure can be built, then the nodes give possible outcomes and normalized weights -- outcome probabilities. A library providing numerically stable polynomial basis for these calculations is available, what make the proposed approach practical."}
{"text": "  Recently diversity-inducing regularization methods for latent variable models (LVMs), which encourage the components in LVMs to be diverse, have been studied to address several issues involved in latent variable modeling: (1) how to capture long-tail patterns underlying data; (2) how to reduce model complexity without sacrificing expressivity; (3) how to improve the interpretability of learned patterns. While the effectiveness of diversity-inducing regularizers such as the mutual angular regularizer has been demonstrated empirically, a rigorous theoretical analysis of them is still missing. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and analyze how the mutual angular regularizer (MAR) affects the generalization performance of supervised LVMs. We use neural network (NN) as a model instance to carry out the study and the analysis shows that increasing the diversity of hidden units in NN would reduce estimation error and increase approximation error. In addition to theoretical analysis, we also present empirical study which demonstrates that the MAR can greatly improve the performance of NN and the empirical observations are in accordance with the theoretical analysis."}
{"text": "  Recent work (Bengio et al., 2013) has shown howDenoising Auto-Encoders(DAE) become gener-ative models as a density estimator. However,in practice, the framework suffers from a mixingproblem in the MCMC sampling process and nodirect method to estimate the test log-likelihood.We consider a directed model with an stochas-tic identity mapping (simple corruption pro-cess) as an inference model and a DAE as agenerative model. By cascading these mod-els, we propose Cascading Denoising Auto-Encoders(CDAE) which can generate samples ofdata distribution from tractable prior distributionunder the assumption that probabilistic distribu-tion of corrupted data approaches tractable priordistribution as the level of corruption increases.This work tries to answer two questions. On theone hand, can deep directed models be success-fully trained without intractable posterior infer-ence and difficult optimization of very deep neu-ral networks in inference and generative mod-els? These are unavoidable when recent suc-cessful directed model like VAE (Kingma &Welling, 2014) is trained on complex dataset likereal images. On the other hand, can DAEs getclean samples of data distribution from heavilycorrupted samples which can be considered oftractable prior distribution far from data mani-fold? so-called global denoising scheme.Our results show positive responses of thesequestions and this work can provide fairly simpleframework for generative models of very com-plex dataset."}
{"text": "  We introduce the \"exponential linear unit\" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a single crop, single model network."}

{"text": "  We introduce the concept of a Modular Autoencoder (MAE), capable of learning a set of diverse but complementary representations from unlabelled data, that can later be used for supervised tasks. The learning of the representations is controlled by a trade off parameter, and we show on six benchmark datasets the optimum lies between two extremes: a set of smaller, independent autoencoders each with low capacity, versus a single monolithic encoding, outperforming an appropriate baseline. In the present paper we explore the special case of linear MAE, and derive an SVD-based algorithm which converges several orders of magnitude faster than gradient descent."}
{"text": "  Latent variable time-series models are among the most heavily used tools from machine learning and applied statistics. These models have the advantage of learning latent structure both from noisy observations and from the temporal ordering in the data, where it is assumed that meaningful correlation structure exists across time. A few highly-structured models, such as the linear dynamical system with linear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference procedures (e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the general rule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models is intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling focuses on approximate inference procedures for one particular class of models. Here, we extend recent developments in stochastic variational inference to develop a `black-box' approximate inference technique for latent variable models with latent dynamical structure. We propose a structured Gaussian variational approximate posterior that carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman filter-smoother but, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach to approximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent variable generative models. We show that our approach recovers accurate estimates in the case of basic models with closed-form posteriors, and more interestingly performs well in comparison to variational approaches that were designed in a bespoke fashion for specific non-conjugate models."}
{"text": "  State-of-the-art speaker recognition relays on models that need a large amount of training data. This models are successful in tasks like NIST SRE because there is sufficient data available. However, in real applications, we usually do not have so much data and, in many cases, the speaker labels are unknown. We present a method to adapt a PLDA model from a domain with a large amount of labeled data to another with unlabeled data. We describe a generative model that produces both sets of data where the unknown labels are modeled like latent variables. We used variational Bayes to estimate the hidden variables. Here, we derive the equations for this model.

{"text": "  We consider the emphatic temporal-difference (TD) algorithm, ETD($\\lambda$), for learning the value functions of stationary policies in a discounted, finite state and action Markov decision process. The ETD($\\lambda$) algorithm was recently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White to solve a long-standing divergence problem of the standard TD algorithm when it is applied to off-policy training, where data from an exploratory policy are used to evaluate other policies of interest. The almost sure convergence of ETD($\\lambda$) has been proved in our recent work under general off-policy training conditions, but for a narrow range of diminishing stepsize. In this paper we present convergence results for constrained versions of ETD($\\lambda$) with constant stepsize and with diminishing stepsize from a broad range. Our results characterize the asymptotic behavior of the trajectory of iterates produced by those algorithms, and are derived by combining key properties of ETD($\\lambda$) with powerful convergence theorems from the weak convergence methods in stochastic approximation theory. For the case of constant stepsize, in addition to analyzing the behavior of the algorithms in the limit as the stepsize parameter approaches zero, we also analyze their behavior for a fixed stepsize and bound the deviations of their averaged iterates from the desired solution. These results are obtained by exploiting the weak Feller property of the Markov chains associated with the algorithms, and by using ergodic theorems for weak Feller Markov chains, in conjunction with the convergence results we get from the weak convergence methods. Besides ETD($\\lambda$), our analysis also applies to the off-policy TD($\\lambda$) algorithm, when the divergence issue is avoided by setting $\\lambda$ sufficiently large."}
{"text": "  Distance-based hierarchical clustering (HC) methods are widely used in unsupervised data analysis but few authors take account of uncertainty in the distance data. We incorporate a statistical model of the uncertainty through corruption or noise in the pairwise distances and investigate the problem of estimating the HC as unknown parameters from measurements. Specifically, we focus on single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) and study its geometry. We prove that under fairly reasonable conditions on the probability distribution governing measurements, SLHC is equivalent to maximum partial profile likelihood estimation (MPPLE) with some of the information contained in the data ignored. At the same time, we show that direct evaluation of SLHC on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of pairwise distances yields a consistent estimator. Consequently, a full MLE is expected to perform better than SLHC in getting the correct HC results for the ground truth metric."}
{"text": "  Early diagnosis of treatable diseases is essential for improving healthcare, and many diseases' onsets are predictable from annual lab tests and their temporal trends. We introduce a multi-resolution convolutional neural network for early detection of multiple diseases from irregularly measured sparse lab values. Our novel architecture takes as input both an imputed version of the data and a binary observation matrix. For imputing the temporal sparse observations, we develop a flexible, fast to train method for differentiable multivariate kernel regression. Our experiments on data from 298K individuals over 8 years, 18 common lab measurements, and 171 diseases show that the temporal signatures learned via convolution are significantly more predictive than baselines commonly used for early disease diagnosis."}

Our focus is on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this \"dendrogram structure'' is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described. These ideas are illustrated by a simple Monte Carlo simulation that, at least for small data sets, suggests the method outperforms SLHC in the presence of noise."}
{"text": "  We study non-convex empirical risk minimization for learning halfspaces and neural networks. For loss functions that are $L$-Lipschitz continuous, we present algorithms to learn halfspaces and multi-layer neural networks that achieve arbitrarily small excess risk $\\epsilon>0$. The time complexity is polynomial in the input dimension $d$ and the sample size $n$, but exponential in the quantity $(L/\\epsilon^2)\\log(L/\\epsilon)$. These algorithms run multiple rounds of random initialization followed by arbitrary optimization steps. We further show that if the data is separable by some neural network with constant margin $\\gamma>0$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning a neural network that separates the training data with margin $\\Omega(\\gamma)$.

{"text": "  The sparsity of natural signals and images in a transform domain or dictionary has been extensively exploited in several applications such as compression, denoising and inverse problems. More recently, data-driven adaptation of synthesis dictionaries has shown promise in many applications compared to fixed or analytical dictionary models. However, dictionary learning problems are typically non-convex and NP-hard, and the usual alternating minimization approaches for these problems are often computationally expensive, with the computations dominated by the NP-hard synthesis sparse coding step. In this work, we investigate an efficient method for $\\ell_{0}$ \"norm\"-based dictionary learning by first approximating the training data set with a sum of sparse rank-one matrices and then using a block coordinate descent approach to estimate the unknowns. The proposed block coordinate descent algorithm involves efficient closed-form solutions. In particular, the sparse coding step involves a simple form of thresholding. We provide a convergence analysis for the proposed block coordinate descent approach. Our numerical experiments show the promising performance and significant speed-ups provided by our method over the classical K-SVD scheme in sparse signal representation and image denoising."}
{"text": "  This essay investigates the question of how the naive Bayes classifier and the support vector machine compare in their ability to forecast the Stock Exchange of Thailand.

Then Radon--Nikodym or least squares theory can be applied, what give $y(x)$ estimator. The probability distribution of $y$ is also obtained, what requires solving generalized eigenvalues problem, matrix spectrum (not depending on $x$) give possible $y$ outcomes and depending on $x$ probabilities of outcomes can be obtained by projecting the distribution with fixed $x$ value (delta--function) to corresponding eigenvector.

{"text": "  Feature selection is important in many big data applications. Two critical challenges closely associate with big data. Firstly, in many big data applications, the dimensionality is extremely high, in millions, and keeps growing. Secondly, big data applications call for highly scalable feature selection algorithms in an online manner such that each feature can be processed in a sequential scan. We present SAOLA, a Scalable and Accurate OnLine Approach for feature selection in this paper. With a theoretical analysis on bounds of the pairwise correlations between features, SAOLA employs novel pairwise comparison techniques and maintain a parsimonious model over time in an online manner. Furthermore, to deal with upcoming features that arrive by groups, we extend the SAOLA algorithm, and then propose a new group-SAOLA algorithm for online group feature selection. The group-SAOLA algorithm can online maintain a set of feature groups that is sparse at the levels of both groups and individual features simultaneously. An empirical study using a series of benchmark real data sets shows that our two algorithms, SAOLA and group-SAOLA, are scalable on data sets of extremely high dimensionality, and have superior performance over the state-of-the-art feature selection methods."}
{"text": "  We present an information-theoretic framework for solving global black-box optimization problems that also have black-box constraints. Of particular interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the constraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic and real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require balancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of PESC and in the actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality approach and develop partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization."}
{"text": "  The understanding of the type of inhibitory interaction plays an important role in drug design. Therefore, researchers are interested to know whether a drug has competitive or non-competitive interaction to particular protein targets.   Method: to analyze the interaction types we propose factorization method Macau which allows us to combine different measurement types into a single tensor together with proteins and compounds. The compounds are characterized by high dimensional 2D ECFP fingerprints. The novelty of the proposed method is that using a specially designed noise injection MCMC sampler it can incorporate high dimensional side information, i.e., millions of unique 2D ECFP compound features, even for large scale datasets of millions of compounds. Without the side information, in this case, the tensor factorization would be practically futile.   Results: using public IC50 and Ki data from ChEMBL we trained a model from where we can identify the latent subspace separating the two measurement types (IC50 and Ki). The results suggest the proposed method can detect the competitive inhibitory activity between compounds and proteins."}
{"text": "  Electric water heaters have the ability to store energy in their water buffer without impacting the comfort of the end user. This feature makes them a prime candidate for residential demand response. However, the stochastic and nonlinear dynamics of electric water heaters, makes it challenging to harness their flexibility. Driven by this challenge, this paper formulates the underlying sequential decision-making problem as a Markov decision process and uses techniques from reinforcement learning. Specifically, we apply an auto-encoder network to find a compact feature representation of the sensor measurements, which helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. A wellknown batch reinforcement learning technique, fitted Q-iteration, is used to find a control policy, given this feature representation. In a simulation-based experiment using an electric water heater with 50 temperature sensors, the proposed method was able to achieve good policies much faster than when using the full state information. In a lab experiment, we apply fitted Q-iteration to an electric water heater with eight temperature sensors. Further reducing the state vector did not improve the results of fitted Q-iteration. The results of the lab experiment, spanning 40 days, indicate that compared to a thermostat controller, the presented approach was able to reduce the total cost of energy consumption of the electric water heater by 15%."}
{"text": "  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were primarily designed for 2-class classification. But they have been extended for N-class classification also based on the requirement of multiclasses in the practical applications. Although N-class classification using SVM has considerable research attention, getting minimum number of classifiers at the time of training and testing is still a continuing research. We propose a new algorithm CBTS-SVM (Centroid based Binary Tree Structured SVM) which addresses this issue. In this we build a binary tree of SVM models based on the similarity of the class labels by finding their distance from the corresponding centroids at the root level. The experimental results demonstrates the comparable accuracy for CBTS with OVO with reasonable gamma and cost values. On the other hand when CBTS is compared with OVA, it gives the better accuracy with reduced training time and testing time. Furthermore CBTS is also scalable as it is able to handle the large data sets."}
{"text": "  Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters."}

Its promise was demonstrated in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), a challenging framework composed of dozens of Atari 2600 games used to evaluate general competency in AI. It achieved dramatically better results than earlier approaches, showing that its ability to learn good representations is quite robust and general. This paper attempts to understand the principles that underlie DQN's impressive performance and to better contextualize its success. We systematically evaluate the importance of key representational biases encoded by DQN's network by proposing simple linear representations that make use of these concepts. Incorporating these characteristics, we obtain a computationally practical feature set that achieves competitive performance to DQN in the ALE. Besides offering insight into the strengths and weaknesses of DQN, we provide a generic representation for the ALE, significantly reducing the burden of learning a representation for each game. Moreover, we also provide a simple, reproducible benchmark for the sake of comparison to future work in the ALE."}
{"text": "  Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm for hidden Markov models, in a sequential data setting. Given a collapsed hidden Markov Model, we break its long Markov chain into a set of short subchains. We propose a novel sum-product algorithm to update the posteriors of the subchains, taking into account their boundary transitions due to the sequential dependencies. Our experiments on two discrete datasets show that our collapsed algorithm is scalable to very large datasets, memory efficient and significantly more accurate than the existing uncollapsed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm in the sequential data setting. Our algorithm is applicable to both finite hidden Markov models and hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov models, and to any datasets generated by emission distributions in the exponential family. Our experiment results on two discrete datasets show that our inference is both more efficient and more accurate than its uncollapsed version, stochastic variational inference."}
{"text": "  A deep learning approach to reinforcement learning led to a general learner able to train on visual input to play a variety of arcade games at the human and superhuman levels. Its creators at the Google DeepMind's team called the approach: Deep Q-Network (DQN). We present an extension of DQN by \"soft\" and \"hard\" attention mechanisms. Tests of the proposed Deep Attention Recurrent Q-Network (DARQN) algorithm on multiple Atari 2600 games show level of performance superior to that of DQN. Moreover, built-in attention mechanisms allow a direct online monitoring of the training process by highlighting the regions of the game screen the agent is focusing on when making decisions."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of similarity learning and its application to image retrieval with large-scale data. The similarity between pairs of images can be measured by the distances between their high dimensional representations, and the problem of learning the appropriate similarity is often addressed by distance metric learning. However, distance metric learning requires the learned metric to be a PSD matrix, which is computational expensive and not necessary for retrieval ranking problem. On the other hand, the bilinear model is shown to be more flexible for large-scale image retrieval task, hence, we adopt it to learn a matrix for estimating pairwise similarities under the regression framework. By adaptively updating the target matrix in regression, we can mimic the hinge loss, which is more appropriate for similarity learning problem. Although the regression problem can have the closed-form solution, the computational cost can be very expensive. The computational challenges come from two aspects: the number of images can be very large and image features have high dimensionality. We address the first challenge by compressing the data by a randomized algorithm with the theoretical guarantee. For the high dimensional issue, we address it by taking low rank assumption and applying alternating method to obtain the partial matrix, which has a global optimal solution. Empirical studies on real world image datasets (i.e., Caltech and ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  Boltzmann machine, as a fundamental construction block of deep belief network and deep Boltzmann machines, is widely used in deep learning community and great success has been achieved. However, theoretical understanding of many aspects of it is still far from clear. In this paper, we studied the Rademacher complexity of both the asymptotic restricted Boltzmann machine and the practical implementation with single-step contrastive divergence (CD-1) procedure. Our results disclose the fact that practical implementation training procedure indeed increased the Rademacher complexity of restricted Boltzmann machines. A further research direction might be the investigation of the VC dimension of a compositional function used in the CD-1 procedure."}
{"text": "  In neuroimaging data analysis, Gaussian graphical models are often used to model statistical dependencies across spatially remote brain regions known as functional connectivity. Typically, data is collected across a cohort of subjects and the scientific objectives consist of estimating population and subject-specific graphical models. A third objective that is often overlooked involves quantifying inter-subject variability and thus identifying regions or sub-networks that demonstrate heterogeneity across subjects. Such information is fundamental in order to thoroughly understand the human connectome. We propose Mixed Neighborhood Selection in order to simultaneously address the three aforementioned objectives. By recasting covariance selection as a neighborhood selection problem we are able to efficiently learn the topology of each node. We introduce an additional mixed effect component to neighborhood selection in order to simultaneously estimate a graphical model for the population of subjects as well as for each individual subject. The proposed method is validated empirically through a series of simulations and applied to resting state data for healthy subjects taken from the ABIDE consortium."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new surrogate loss function called orbit loss in the structured prediction framework, which has good theoretical and practical advantages. While the orbit loss is not convex, it has a simple analytical gradient and a simple perceptron-like learning rule. We analyze the new loss theoretically and state a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound. We also prove that the new loss is consistent in the strong sense; namely, the risk achieved by the set of the trained parameters approaches the infimum risk achievable by any linear decoder over the given features. Methods that are aimed at risk minimization, such as the structured ramp loss, the structured probit loss and the direct loss minimization require at least two inference operations per training iteration. In this sense, the orbit loss is more efficient as it requires only one inference operation per training iteration, while yields similar performance. We conclude the paper with an empirical comparison of the proposed loss function to the structured hinge loss, the structured ramp loss, the structured probit loss and the direct loss minimization method on several benchmark datasets and tasks."}
{"text": "  Teaching dimension is a learning theoretic quantity that specifies the minimum training set size to teach a target model to a learner. Previous studies on teaching dimension focused on version-space learners which maintain all hypotheses consistent with the training data, and cannot be applied to modern machine learners which select a specific hypothesis via optimization. This paper presents the first known teaching dimension for ridge regression, support vector machines, and logistic regression. We also exhibit optimal training sets that match these teaching dimensions. Our approach generalizes to other linear learners."}
{"text": "  With the success of modern internet based platform, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, it is now normal to collect a large number of hand labeled samples from non-experts. The Dawid- Skene algorithm, which is based on Expectation- Maximization update, has been widely used for inferring the true labels from noisy crowdsourced labels. However, Dawid-Skene scheme requires all the data to perform each EM iteration, and can be infeasible for streaming data or large scale data. In this paper, we provide an online version of Dawid- Skene algorithm that only requires one data frame for each iteration. Further, we prove that under mild conditions, the online Dawid-Skene scheme with projection converges to a stationary point of the marginal log-likelihood of the observed data. Our experiments demonstrate that the online Dawid- Skene scheme achieves state of the art performance comparing with other methods based on the Dawid- Skene scheme."}
{"text": "  In many problems in machine learning and operations research, we need to optimize a function whose input is a random variable or a probability density function, i.e. to solve optimization problems in an infinite dimensional space. On the other hand, online learning has the advantage of dealing with streaming examples, and better model a changing environ- ment. In this paper, we extend the celebrated online gradient descent algorithm to Hilbert spaces (function spaces), and analyze the convergence guarantee of the algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithms can be useful in several important problems."}
{"text": "  We investigate a class of feature allocation models that generalize the Indian buffet process and are parameterized by Gibbs-type random measures. Two existing classes are contained as special cases: the original two-parameter Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Dirichlet process, and the stable (or three-parameter) Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Pitman--Yor process. Asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs-type partitions, such as power laws holding for the number of latent clusters, translates into analogous characteristics for this class of Gibbs-type feature allocation models. Despite containing several different distinct subclasses, the properties of Gibbs-type partitions allow us to develop a black-box procedure for posterior inference within any subclass of models. Through numerical experiments, we compare and contrast a few of these subclasses and highlight the utility of varying power-law behaviors in the latent features."}
{"text": "  Gated networks are networks that contain gating connections, in which the outputs of at least two neurons are multiplied. Initially, gated networks were used to learn relationships between two input sources, such as pixels from two images. More recently, they have been applied to learning activity recognition or multi-modal representations. The aims of this paper are threefold: 1) to explain the basic computations in gated networks to the non-expert, while adopting a standpoint that insists on their symmetric nature. 2) to serve as a quick reference guide to the recent literature, by providing an inventory of applications of these networks, as well as recent extensions to the basic architecture. 3) to suggest future research directions and applications."}
{"text": "  Topic models are popular for modeling discrete data (e.g., texts, images, videos, links), and provide an efficient way to discover hidden structures/semantics in massive data. One of the core problems in this field is the posterior inference for individual data instances. This problem is particularly important in streaming environments, but is often intractable. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) for recovering sparse solutions to posterior inference. From detailed elucidation of both theoretical and practical aspects, FW exhibits many interesting properties which are beneficial to topic modeling. We then employ FW to design fast methods, including ML-FW, for learning latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) at large scales. Extensive experiments show that to reach the same predictiveness level, ML-FW can perform tens to thousand times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods for learning LDA from massive/streaming data."}
{"text": "  One of the core problems in statistical models is the estimation of a posterior distribution. For topic models, the problem of posterior inference for individual texts is particularly important, especially when dealing with data streams, but is often intractable in the worst case. As a consequence, existing methods for posterior inference are approximate and do not have any guarantee on neither quality nor convergence rate. In this paper, we introduce a provably fast algorithm, namely Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (OPE), for posterior inference in topic models. OPE has more attractive properties than existing inference approaches, including theoretical guarantees on quality and fast rate of convergence to a local maximal/stationary point of the inference problem. The discussions about OPE are very general and hence can be easily employed in a wide range of contexts. Finally, we employ OPE to design three methods for learning Latent Dirichlet Allocation from text streams or large corpora. Extensive experiments demonstrate some superior behaviors of OPE and of our new learning methods."}
{"text": "  Recursive partitioning approaches producing tree-like models are a long standing staple of predictive modeling, in the last decade mostly as ``sub-learners'' within state of the art ensemble methods like Boosting and Random Forest. However, a fundamental flaw in the partitioning (or splitting) rule of commonly used tree building methods precludes them from treating different types of variables equally. This most clearly manifests in these methods' inability to properly utilize categorical variables with a large number of categories, which are ubiquitous in the new age of big data. Such variables can often be very informative, but current tree methods essentially leave us a choice of either not using them, or exposing our models to severe overfitting. We propose a conceptual framework to splitting using leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation for selecting the splitting variable, then performing a regular split (in our case, following CART's approach) for the selected variable. The most important consequence of our approach is that categorical variables with many categories can be safely used in tree building and are only chosen if they contribute to predictive power. We demonstrate in extensive simulation and real data analysis that our novel splitting approach significantly improves the performance of both single tree models and ensemble methods that utilize trees. Importantly, we design an algorithm for LOO splitting variable selection which under reasonable assumptions does not increase the overall computational complexity compared to CART for two-class classification. For regression tasks, our approach carries an increased computational burden, replacing a O(log(n)) factor in CART splitting rule search with an O(n) term."}
{"text": "  k-medoids algorithm is a partitional, centroid-based clustering algorithm which uses pairwise distances of data points and tries to directly decompose the dataset with $n$ points into a set of $k$ disjoint clusters. However, k-medoids itself requires all distances between data points that are not so easy to get in many applications. In this paper, we introduce a new method which requires only a small proportion of the whole set of distances and makes an effort to estimate an upper-bound for unknown distances using the inquired ones. This algorithm makes use of the triangle inequality to calculate an upper-bound estimation of the unknown distances. Our method is built upon a recursive approach to cluster objects and to choose some points actively from each bunch of data and acquire the distances between these prominent points from oracle. Experimental results show that the proposed method using only a small subset of the distances can find proper clustering on many real-world and synthetic datasets."}
{"text": "  Despite the importance of sparsity in many large-scale applications, there are few methods for distributed optimization of sparsity-inducing objectives. In this paper, we present a communication-efficient framework for L1-regularized optimization in the distributed environment. By viewing classical objectives in a more general primal-dual setting, we develop a new class of methods that can be efficiently distributed and applied to common sparsity-inducing models, such as Lasso, sparse logistic regression, and elastic net-regularized problems. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our framework, and demonstrate its efficiency and flexibility with a thorough experimental comparison on Amazon EC2. Our proposed framework yields speedups of up to 50x as compared to current state-of-the-art methods for distributed L1-regularized optimization."}
{"text": "  Modern cities experience heavy traffic flows and congestions regularly across space and time. Monitoring traffic situations becomes an important challenge for the Traffic Control and Surveillance Systems (TCSS). In advanced TCSS, it is helpful to automatically detect and classify different traffic incidents such as severity of congestion, abnormal driving pattern, abrupt or illegal stop on road, etc. Although most TCSS are equipped with basic incident detection algorithms, they are however crude to be really useful as an automated tool for further classification. In literature, there is a lack of research for Automated Incident Classification (AIC). Therefore, a novel AIC method is proposed in this paper to tackle such challenges. In the proposed method, traffic signals are firstly extracted from captured videos and converted as spatial-temporal (ST) signals. Based on the characteristics of the ST signals, a set of realistic simulation data are generated to construct an extended big traffic database to cover a variety of traffic situations. Next, a Mean-Shift filter is introduced to suppress the effect of noise and extract significant features from the ST signals. The extracted features are then associated with various types of traffic data: one normal type (inliers) and multiple abnormal types (outliers). For the classification, an adaptive boosting classifier is trained to detect outliers in traffic data automatically. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is adopted to train the model for identifying the categories of outliers. In short, this hybrid approach is called an Adaptive Boosting Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM) method. Experimental results show that the proposed AB-SVM method achieves a satisfied result with more than 92% classification accuracy on average."}
{"text": "  Partially observed control problems are a challenging aspect of reinforcement learning. We extend two related, model-free algorithms for continuous control -- deterministic policy gradient and stochastic value gradient -- to solve partially observed domains using recurrent neural networks trained with backpropagation through time.   We demonstrate that this approach, coupled with long-short term memory is able to solve a variety of physical control problems exhibiting an assortment of memory requirements. These include the short-term integration of information from noisy sensors and the identification of system parameters, as well as long-term memory problems that require preserving information over many time steps. We also demonstrate success on a combined exploration and memory problem in the form of a simplified version of the well-known Morris water maze task. Finally, we show that our approach can deal with high-dimensional observations by learning directly from pixels.   We find that recurrent deterministic and stochastic policies are able to learn similarly good solutions to these tasks, including the water maze where the agent must learn effective search strategies."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we investigate the usage of autoencoders in modeling textual data. Traditional autoencoders suffer from at least two aspects: scalability with the high dimensionality of vocabulary size and dealing with task-irrelevant words. We address this problem by introducing supervision via the loss function of autoencoders. In particular, we first train a linear classifier on the labeled data, then define a loss for the autoencoder with the weights learned from the linear classifier. To reduce the bias brought by one single classifier, we define a posterior probability distribution on the weights of the classifier, and derive the marginalized loss of the autoencoder with Laplace approximation. We show that our choice of loss function can be rationalized from the perspective of Bregman Divergence, which justifies the soundness of our model. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on six sentiment analysis datasets, and show that our model significantly outperforms all the competing methods with respect to classification accuracy. We also show that our model is able to take advantage of unlabeled dataset and get improved performance. We further show that our model successfully learns highly discriminative feature maps, which explains its superior performance."}
{"text": "  This paper explains the DYCOS-Algorithm as it was introduced in by Aggarwal and Li in 2011. It operates on graphs whichs nodes are partially labeled and automatically adds missing labels to nodes. To do so, the DYCOS algorithm makes use of the structure of the graph as well as content which is assigned to the node. Aggarwal and Li measured in an experimental analysis that DYCOS adds the missing labels to a Graph with 19396 nodes of which 14814 are labeled and another Graph with 806635 nodes of which 18999 are labeld on one core of an Intel Xeon 2.5 GHz CPU with 32 G RAM within less than a minute.

{"text": "  Matrix factorization (MF) and Autoencoder (AE) are among the most successful approaches of unsupervised learning. While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE's application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures."}
{"text": "  The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a widely used random graph model for networks with communities. Despite the recent burst of interest in recovering communities in the SBM from statistical and computational points of view, there are still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic and computational limits of recovery. In this paper, we consider the SBM in its full generality, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of communities or how they grow with the number of nodes, as well as on the connection probabilities inside or across communities. This generality allows us to move past the artifacts of homogenous SBM, and understand the right parameters (such as the relative densities of communities) that define the various recovery thresholds. We outline the implications of our generalizations via a set of illustrative examples. For instance, $\\log n$ is considered to be the standard lower bound on the cluster size for exact recovery via convex methods, for homogenous SBM. We show that it is possible, in the right circumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the cluster, the denser), to recover very small clusters (up to $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ size), if there are just a few of them (at most polylogarithmic in $n$)."}
{"text": "  Minimizing empirical risk subject to a set of constraints can be a useful strategy for learning restricted classes of functions, such as monotonic functions, submodular functions, classifiers that guarantee a certain class label for some subset of examples, etc. However, these restrictions may result in a very large number of constraints. Projected stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is often the default choice for large-scale optimization in machine learning, but requires a projection after each update. For heavily-constrained objectives, we propose an efficient extension of SGD that stays close to the feasible region while only applying constraints probabilistically at each iteration. Theoretical analysis shows a compelling trade-off between per-iteration work and the number of iterations needed on problems with a large number of constraints."}
{"text": "  When learning a hidden Markov model (HMM), sequen- tial observations can often be complemented by real-valued summary response variables generated from the path of hid- den states. Such settings arise in numerous domains, includ- ing many applications in biology, like motif discovery and genome annotation. In this paper, we present a flexible frame- work for jointly modeling both latent sequence features and the functional mapping that relates the summary response variables to the hidden state sequence. The algorithm is com- patible with a rich set of mapping functions. Results show that the availability of additional continuous response vari- ables can simultaneously improve the annotation of the se- quential observations and yield good prediction performance in both synthetic data and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "  It has recently been shown that supervised learning with the popular logistic loss is equivalent to optimizing the exponential loss over sufficient statistics about the class: Rademacher observations (rados). We first show that this unexpected equivalence can actually be generalized to other example / rado losses, with necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence, exemplified on four losses that bear popular names in various fields: exponential (boosting), mean-variance (finance), Linear Hinge (on-line learning), ReLU (deep learning), and unhinged (statistics). Second, we show that the generalization unveils a surprising new connection to regularized learning, and in particular a sufficient condition under which regularizing the loss over examples is equivalent to regularizing the rados (with Minkowski sums) in the equivalent rado loss. This brings simple and powerful rado-based learning algorithms for sparsity-controlling regularization, that we exemplify on a boosting algorithm for the regularized exponential rado-loss, which formally boosts over four types of regularization, including the popular ridge and lasso, and the recently coined slope --- we obtain the first proven boosting algorithm for this last regularization. Through our first contribution on the equivalence of rado and example-based losses, Omega-R.AdaBoost~appears to be an efficient proxy to boost the regularized logistic loss over examples using whichever of the four regularizers. Experiments display that regularization consistently improves performances of rado-based learning, and may challenge or beat the state of the art of example-based learning even when learning over small sets of rados. Finally, we connect regularization to differential privacy, and display how tiny budgets can be afforded on big domains while beating (protected) example-based learning."}
{"text": "  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) stand at the forefront of many recent developments in deep learning. Yet a major difficulty with these models is their tendency to overfit, with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers. Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning."}
{"text": "  Causal inference deals with identifying which random variables \"cause\" or control other random variables. Recent advances on the topic of causal inference based on tools from statistical estimation and machine learning have resulted in practical algorithms for causal inference. Causal inference has the potential to have significant impact on medical research, prevention and control of diseases, and identifying factors that impact economic changes to name just a few. However, these promising applications for causal inference are often ones that involve sensitive or personal data of users that need to be kept private (e.g., medical records, personal finances, etc). Therefore, there is a need for the development of causal inference methods that preserve data privacy. We study the problem of inferring causality using the current, popular causal inference framework, the additive noise model (ANM) while simultaneously ensuring privacy of the users. Our framework provides differential privacy guarantees for a variety of ANM variants. We run extensive experiments, and demonstrate that our techniques are practical and easy to implement."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel classification model for weak signal data, building upon a recent model for Bayesian multi-view learning, Group Factor Analysis (GFA). Instead of assuming all data to come from a single GFA model, we allow latent clusters, each having a different GFA model and producing a different class distribution. We show that sharing information across the clusters, by sharing factors, increases the classification accuracy considerably; the shared factors essentially form a flexible noise model that explains away the part of data not related to classification. Motivation for the setting comes from single-trial functional brain imaging data, having a very low signal-to-noise ratio and a natural multi-view setting, with the different sensors, measurement modalities (EEG, MEG, fMRI) and possible auxiliary information as views. We demonstrate our model on a MEG dataset."}
{"text": "  We investigate properties of estimators obtained by minimization of U-processes with the Lasso penalty in high-dimensional settings. Our attention is focused on the ranking problem that is popular in machine learning. It is related to guessing the ordering between objects on the basis of their observed predictors. We prove the oracle inequality for the excess risk of the considered estimator as well as the bound for the l1 distance between the estimator and the oracle."}
{"text": "  Coordinate descent is one of the most popular approaches for solving Lasso and its extensions due to its simplicity and efficiency. When applying coordinate descent to solving Lasso, we update one coordinate at a time while fixing the remaining coordinates. Such an update, which is usually easy to compute, greedily decreases the objective function value. In this paper, we aim to improve its computational efficiency by reducing the number of coordinate descent iterations. To this end, we propose a novel technique called Successive Ray Refinement (SRR). SRR makes use of the following ray continuation property on the successive iterations: for a particular coordinate, the value obtained in the next iteration almost always lies on a ray that starts at its previous iteration and passes through the current iteration. Motivated by this ray-continuation property, we propose that coordinate descent be performed not directly on the previous iteration but on a refined search point that has the following properties: on one hand, it lies on a ray that starts at a history solution and passes through the previous iteration, and on the other hand, it achieves the minimum objective function value among all the points on the ray. We propose two schemes for defining the search point and show that the refined search point can be efficiently obtained. Empirical results for real and synthetic data sets show that the proposed SRR can significantly reduce the number of coordinate descent iterations, especially for small Lasso regularization parameters."}
{"text": "  We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the posterior measure over the trajec- tories of a diffusion process from discrete time observations and continuous time constraints. We cast the problem in a Bayesian framework and derive approximations to the posterior distributions of single time marginals using variational approximate inference. We then show how the approximation can be extended to a wide class of discrete-state Markov jump pro- cesses by making use of the chemical Langevin equation. Our empirical results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides good approximations for these classes of inverse problems."}
{"text": "  Data mining practitioners are facing challenges from data with network structure. In this paper, we address a specific class of global-state networks which comprises of a set of network instances sharing a similar structure yet having different values at local nodes. Each instance is associated with a global state which indicates the occurrence of an event. The objective is to uncover a small set of discriminative subnetworks that can optimally classify global network values. Unlike most existing studies which explore an exponential subnetwork space, we address this difficult problem by adopting a space transformation approach. Specifically, we present an algorithm that optimizes a constrained dual-objective function to learn a low-dimensional subspace that is capable of discriminating networks labelled by different global states, while reconciling with common network topology sharing across instances. Our algorithm takes an appealing approach from spectral graph learning and we show that the globally optimum solution can be achieved via matrix eigen-decomposition."}
{"text": "  Churn prediction, or the task of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue use of a service, is an important and lucrative concern of firms in many different industries. As these firms collect an increasing amount of large-scale, heterogeneous data on the characteristics and behaviors of customers, new methods become possible for predicting churn. In this paper, we present a unified analytic framework for detecting the early warning signs of churn, and assigning a \"Churn Score\" to each customer that indicates the likelihood that the particular individual will churn within a predefined amount of time. This framework employs a brute force approach to feature engineering, then winnows the set of relevant attributes via feature selection, before feeding the final feature-set into a suite of supervised learning algorithms. Using several terabytes of data from a large mobile phone network, our method identifies several intuitive - and a few surprising - early warning signs of churn, and our best model predicts whether a subscriber will churn with 89.4% accuracy."}
{"text": "  Embedding learning, a.k.a. representation learning, has been shown to be able to model large-scale semantic knowledge graphs. A key concept is a mapping of the knowledge graph to a tensor representation whose entries are predicted by models using latent representations of generalized entities. Knowledge graphs are typically treated as static: A knowledge graph grows more links when more facts become available but the ground truth values associated with links is considered time invariant. In this paper we address the issue of knowledge graphs where triple states depend on time. We assume that changes in the knowledge graph always arrive in form of events, in the sense that the events are the gateway to the knowledge graph. We train an event prediction model which uses both knowledge graph background information and information on recent events. By predicting future events, we also predict likely changes in the knowledge graph and thus obtain a model for the evolution of the knowledge graph as well. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach performs well in a clinical application, a recommendation engine and a sensor network application."}

{"text": "  In an online decision problem, one makes decisions often with a pool of decision sequence called experts but without knowledge of the future. After each step, one pays a cost based on the decision and observed rate. One reasonal goal would be to perform as well as the best expert in the pool. The modern and well-known way to attain this goal is the algorithm of exponential weighting. However, recently, another algorithm called follow the perturbed leader is developed and achieved about the same performance. In our work, we first show the properties shared in common by the two algorithms which explain the similarities on the performance. Next we will show that for a specific perturbation, the two algorithms are identical. Finally, we show with some examples that follow-the-leader style algorithms extend naturally to a large class of structured online problems for which the exponential algorithms are inefficient."}

{"text": "  Learning in deep models using Bayesian methods has generated significant attention recently. This is largely because of the feasibility of modern Bayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a measure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for large-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient thermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a thermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior distributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion increases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so better use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use of an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the traditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more accurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be desirable in Bayesian deep learning. Extensive experiments on two canonical models and their deep extensions demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves general Bayesian posterior sampling, particularly for deep models."}
{"text": "  Effective training of deep neural networks suffers from two main issues. The first is that the parameter spaces of these models exhibit pathological curvature. Recent methods address this problem by using adaptive preconditioning for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These methods improve convergence by adapting to the local geometry of parameter space. A second issue is overfitting, which is typically addressed by early stopping. However, recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian model averaging mitigates this problem. The posterior can be sampled by using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). However, the rapidly changing curvature renders default SGLD methods inefficient. Here, we propose combining adaptive preconditioners with SGLD. In support of this idea, we give theoretical properties on asymptotic convergence and predictive risk. We also provide empirical results for Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Nets, and Convolutional Neural Nets, demonstrating that our preconditioned SGLD method gives state-of-the-art performance on these models."}
{"text": "  As one of the most popular classifiers, linear SVMs still have challenges in dealing with very large-scale problems, even though linear or sub-linear algorithms have been developed recently on single machines. Parallel computing methods have been developed for learning large-scale SVMs. However, existing methods rely on solving local sub-optimization problems. In this paper, we develop a novel parallel algorithm for learning large-scale linear SVM. Our approach is based on a data augmentation equivalent formulation, which casts the problem of learning SVM as a Bayesian inference problem, for which we can develop very efficient parallel sampling methods. We provide empirical results for this parallel sampling SVM, and provide extensions for SVR, non-linear kernels, and provide a parallel implementation of the Crammer and Singer model. This approach is very promising in its own right, and further is a very useful technique to parallelize a broader family of general maximum-margin models."}
{"text": "  There are around a hundred installed apps on an average smartphone. The high number of apps and the limited number of app icons that can be displayed on the device's screen requires a new paradigm to address their visibility to the user. In this paper we propose a new online algorithm for dynamically predicting a set of apps that the user is likely to use. The algorithm runs on the user's device and constantly learns the user's habits at a given time, location, and device state. It is designed to actively help the user to navigate to the desired app as well as to provide a personalized feeling, and hence is aimed at maximizing the AUC. We show both theoretically and empirically that the algorithm maximizes the AUC, and yields good results on a set of 1,000 devices."}
{"text": "  Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validate the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  The histogram method is a powerful non-parametric approach for estimating the probability density function of a continuous variable. But the construction of a histogram, compared to the parametric approaches, demands a large number of observations to capture the underlying density function. Thus it is not suitable for analyzing a sparse data set, a collection of units with a small size of data. In this paper, by employing the probabilistic topic model, we develop a novel Bayesian approach to alleviating the sparsity problem in the conventional histogram estimation. Our method estimates a unit's density function as a mixture of basis histograms, in which the number of bins for each basis, as well as their heights, is determined automatically. The estimation procedure is performed by using the fast and easy-to-implement collapsed Gibbs sampling. We apply the proposed method to synthetic data, showing that it performs well."}
{"text": "  We explore the problem of binary classification in machine learning, with a twist - the classifier is allowed to abstain on any datum, professing ignorance about the true class label without committing to any prediction. This is directly motivated by applications like medical diagnosis and fraud risk assessment, in which incorrect predictions have potentially calamitous consequences. We focus on a recent spate of theoretically driven work in this area that characterizes how allowing abstentions can lead to fewer errors in very general settings. Two areas are highlighted: the surprising possibility of zero-error learning, and the fundamental tradeoff between predicting sufficiently often and avoiding incorrect predictions. We review efficient algorithms with provable guarantees for each of these areas. We also discuss connections to other scenarios, notably active learning, as they suggest promising directions of further inquiry in this emerging field."}
{"text": "  We explore the application of kernel-based multi-task learning techniques to forecast the demand of electricity in multiple nodes of a distribution network. We show that recently developed output kernel learning techniques are particularly well suited to solve this problem, as they allow to flexibly model the complex seasonal effects that characterize electricity demand data, while learning and exploiting correlations between multiple demand profiles. We also demonstrate that kernels with a multiplicative structure yield superior predictive performance with respect to the widely adopted (generalized) additive models. Our study is based on residential and industrial smart meter data provided by the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)."}
{"text": "  Causal discovery algorithms based on probabilistic graphical models have emerged in geoscience applications for the identification and visualization of dynamical processes. The key idea is to learn the structure of a graphical model from observed spatio-temporal data, which indicates information flow, thus pathways of interactions, in the observed physical system. Studying those pathways allows geoscientists to learn subtle details about the underlying dynamical mechanisms governing our planet. Initial studies using this approach on real-world atmospheric data have shown great potential for scientific discovery. However, in these initial studies no ground truth was available, so that the resulting graphs have been evaluated only by whether a domain expert thinks they seemed physically plausible. This paper seeks to fill this gap. We develop a testbed that emulates two dynamical processes dominant in many geoscience applications, namely advection and diffusion, in a 2D grid. Then we apply the causal discovery based information tracking algorithms to the simulation data to study how well the algorithms work for different scenarios and to gain a better understanding of the physical meaning of the graph results, in particular of instantaneous connections. We make all data sets used in this study available to the community as a benchmark.   Keywords: Information flow, graphical model, structure learning, causal discovery, geoscience."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel class of time-varying nonparanormal graphical models, which allows us to model high dimensional heavy-tailed systems and the evolution of their latent network structures. Under this model, we develop statistical tests for presence of edges both locally at a fixed index value and globally over a range of values. The tests are developed for a high-dimensional regime, are robust to model selection mistakes and do not require commonly assumed minimum signal strength. The testing procedures are based on a high dimensional, debiasing-free moment estimator, which uses a novel kernel smoothed Kendall's tau correlation matrix as an input statistic. The estimator consistently estimates the latent inverse Pearson correlation matrix uniformly in both the index variable and kernel bandwidth. Its rate of convergence is shown to be minimax optimal. Our method is supported by thorough numerical simulations and an application to a neural imaging data set."}
{"text": "  Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso, whose distribution can be characterized in an efficient manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism."}
{"text": "  In compressed sensing, in order to recover a sparse or nearly sparse vector from possibly noisy measurements, the most popular approach is $\\ell_1$-norm minimization. Upper bounds for the $\\ell_2$- norm of the error between the true and estimated vectors are given in [1] and reviewed in [2], while bounds for the $\\ell_1$-norm are given in [3]. When the unknown vector is not conventionally sparse but is \"group sparse\" instead, a variety of alternatives to the $\\ell_1$-norm have been proposed in the literature, including the group LASSO, sparse group LASSO, and group LASSO with tree structured overlapping groups. However, no error bounds are available for any of these modified objective functions. In the present paper, a unified approach is presented for deriving upper bounds on the error between the true vector and its approximation, based on the notion of decomposable and $\\gamma$-decomposable norms. The bounds presented cover all of the norms mentioned above, and also provide a guideline for choosing norms in future to accommodate alternate forms of sparsity."}
{"text": "  Latent state space models are a fundamental and widely used tool for modeling dynamical systems. However, they are difficult to learn from data and learned models often lack performance guarantees on inference tasks such as filtering and prediction. In this work, we present the PREDICTIVE STATE INFERENCE MACHINE (PSIM), a data-driven method that considers the inference procedure on a dynamical system as a composition of predictors. The key idea is that rather than first learning a latent state space model, and then using the learned model for inference, PSIM directly learns predictors for inference in predictive state space. We provide theoretical guarantees for inference, in both realizable and agnostic settings, and showcase practical performance on a variety of simulated and real world robotics benchmarks."}
{"text": "  We study the fundamental tradeoffs between computational tractability and statistical accuracy for a general family of hypothesis testing problems with combinatorial structures. Based upon an oracle model of computation, which captures the interactions between algorithms and data, we establish a general lower bound that explicitly connects the minimum testing risk under computational budget constraints with the intrinsic probabilistic and combinatorial structures of statistical problems. This lower bound mirrors the classical statistical lower bound by Le Cam (1986) and allows us to quantify the optimal statistical performance achievable given limited computational budgets in a systematic fashion. Under this unified framework, we sharply characterize the statistical-computational phase transition for two testing problems, namely, normal mean detection and sparse principal component detection. For normal mean detection, we consider two combinatorial structures, namely, sparse set and perfect matching. For these problems we identify significant gaps between the optimal statistical accuracy that is achievable under computational tractability constraints and the classical statistical lower bounds. Compared with existing works on computational lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms on Turing machines, and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection, we focus on the oracle computational model, which covers a broad range of popular algorithms, and do not rely on unproven hypotheses. Moreover, our result provides an intuitive and concrete interpretation for the intrinsic computational intractability of high-dimensional statistical problems. One byproduct of our result is a lower bound for a strict generalization of the matrix permanent problem, which is of independent interest."}
{"text": "  We introduce a general framework for estimation of inverse covariance, or precision, matrices from heterogeneous populations. The proposed framework uses a Laplacian shrinkage penalty to encourage similarity among estimates from disparate, but related, subpopulations, while allowing for differences among matrices. We propose an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for parameter estimation, as well as its extension for faster computation in high dimensions by thresholding the empirical covariance matrix to identify the joint block diagonal structure in the estimated precision matrices. We establish both variable selection and norm consistency of the proposed estimator for distributions with exponential or polynomial tails. Further, to extend the applicability of the method to the settings with unknown populations structure, we propose a Laplacian penalty based on hierarchical clustering, and discuss conditions under which this data-driven choice results in consistent estimation of precision matrices in heterogenous populations. Extensive numerical studies and applications to gene expression data from subtypes of cancer with distinct clinical outcomes indicate the potential advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches."}
{"text": "  The aim of this paper is to provide a new method for learning the relationships between data that have been obtained independently. Unlike existing methods like matching, the proposed technique does not require any contextual information, provided that the dependency between the variables of interest is monotone. It can therefore be easily combined with matching in order to exploit the advantages of both methods. This technique can be described as a mix between quantile matching, and deconvolution. We provide for it a theoretical and an empirical validation."}
{"text": "  Based on NFL game data we try to predict the outcome of a play in multiple different ways. An application of this is the following: by plugging in various play options one could determine the best play for a given situation in real time. While the outcome of a play can be described in many ways we had the most promising results with a newly defined measure that we call \"progress\". We see this work as a first step to include predictive analysis into NFL playcalling."}
{"text": "  A Support Vector Machine (SVM) has become a very popular machine learning method for text classification. One reason for this relates to the range of existing kernels which allow for classifying data that is not linearly separable. The linear, polynomial and RBF (Gaussian Radial Basis Function) kernel are commonly used and serve as a basis of comparison in our study. We show how to derive the primal form of the quadratic Power Kernel (PK) -- also called the Negative Euclidean Distance Kernel (NDK) -- by means of complex numbers. We exemplify the NDK in the framework of text categorization using the Dewey Document Classification (DDC) as the target scheme. Our evaluation shows that the power kernel produces F-scores that are comparable to the reference kernels, but is -- except for the linear kernel -- faster to compute. Finally, we show how to extend the NDK-approach by including the Mahalanobis distance."}
{"text": "  We present a novel hierarchical approach to multi-class classification which is generic in that it can be applied to different classification models (e.g., support vector machines, perceptrons), and makes no explicit assumptions about the probabilistic structure of the problem as it is usually done in multi-class classification. By adding a cascade of additional classifiers, each of which receives the previous classifier's output in addition to regular input data, the approach harnesses unused information that manifests itself in the form of, e.g., correlations between predicted classes. Using multilayer perceptrons as a classification model, we demonstrate the validity of this approach by testing it on a complex ten-class 3D gesture recognition task."}
{"text": "  We present a novel method to perform multi-class pattern classification with neural networks and test it on a challenging 3D hand gesture recognition problem. Our method consists of a standard one-against-all (OAA) classification, followed by another network layer classifying the resulting class scores, possibly augmented by the original raw input vector. This allows the network to disambiguate hard-to-separate classes as the distribution of class scores carries considerable information as well, and is in fact often used for assessing the confidence of a decision. We show that by this approach we are able to significantly boost our results, overall as well as for particular difficult cases, on the hard 10-class gesture classification task."}
{"text": "  This paper is about index policies for minimizing (frequentist) regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit model, inspired by a Bayesian view on the problem. Our main contribution is to prove that the Bayes-UCB algorithm, which relies on quantiles of posterior distributions, is asymptotically optimal when the reward distributions belong to a one-dimensional exponential family, for a large class of prior distributions. We also show that the Bayesian literature gives new insight on what kind of exploration rates could be used in frequentist, UCB-type algorithms. Indeed, approximations of the Bayesian optimal solution or the Finite Horizon Gittins indices provide a justification for the kl-UCB+ and kl-UCB-H+ algorithms, whose asymptotic optimality is also established."}
{"text": "  Time series classification is an application of particular interest with the increase of data to monitor. Classical techniques for time series classification rely on point-to-point distances. Recently, Bag-of-Words approaches have been used in this context. Words are quantized versions of simple features extracted from sliding windows. The SIFT framework has proved efficient for image classification. In this paper, we design a time series classification scheme that builds on the SIFT framework adapted to time series to feed a Bag-of-Words. We then refine our method by studying the impact of normalized Bag-of-Words, as well as densely extract point descriptors. Proposed adjustements achieve better performance. The evaluation shows that our method outperforms classical techniques in terms of classification."}
{"text": "  In this paper, a novel approach for coding nominal data is proposed. For the given nominal data, a rank in a form of complex number is assigned. The proposed method does not lose any information about the attribute and brings other properties previously unknown. The approach based on these knew properties can been used for classification. The analyzed example shows that classification with the use of coded nominal data or both numerical as well as coded nominal data is more effective than the classification, which uses only numerical data."}
{"text": "  We design and analyze algorithms for online linear optimization that have optimal regret and at the same time do not need to know any upper or lower bounds on the norm of the loss vectors. Our algorithms are instances of the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) and Mirror Descent (MD) meta-algorithms. We achieve adaptiveness to the norms of the loss vectors by scale invariance, i.e., our algorithms make exactly the same decisions if the sequence of loss vectors is multiplied by any positive constant. The algorithm based on FTRL works for any decision set, bounded or unbounded. For unbounded decisions sets, this is the first adaptive algorithm for online linear optimization with a non-vacuous regret bound. In contrast, we show lower bounds on scale-free algorithms based on MD on unbounded domains."}
{"text": "  The Brazilian government often misclassifies the goods it buys. That makes it hard to audit government expenditures. We cannot know whether the price paid for a ballpoint pen (code #7510) was reasonable if the pen was misclassified as a technical drawing pen (code #6675) or as any other good. This paper shows how we can use machine learning to reduce misclassification. I trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that takes a product description as input and returns the most likely category codes as output. I trained the classifier using 20 million goods purchased by the Brazilian government between 1999-04-01 and 2015-04-02. In 83.3% of the cases the correct category code was one of the three most likely category codes identified by the classifier. I used the trained classifier to develop a web app that might help the government reduce misclassification. I open sourced the code on GitHub; anyone can use and modify it."}
{"text": "  Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning becomes increasingly important due to the recent rapid growth of data. This paper focuses on a class of regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) machine learning problems, and develops two methods to provide differential privacy to distributed learning algorithms over a network. We first decentralize the learning algorithm using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and propose the methods of dual variable perturbation and primal variable perturbation to provide dynamic differential privacy. The two mechanisms lead to algorithms that can provide privacy guarantees under mild conditions of the convexity and differentiability of the loss function and the regularizer. We study the performance of the algorithms, and show that the dual variable perturbation outperforms its primal counterpart. To design an optimal privacy mechanisms, we analyze the fundamental tradeoff between privacy and accuracy, and provide guidelines to choose privacy parameters. Numerical experiments using customer information database are performed to corroborate the results on privacy and utility tradeoffs and design."}
{"text": "  In a real-world data set there is always the possibility, rather high in our opinion, that different features may have different degrees of relevance. Most machine learning algorithms deal with this fact by either selecting or deselecting features in the data preprocessing phase. However, we maintain that even among relevant features there may be different degrees of relevance, and this should be taken into account during the clustering process. With over 50 years of history, K-Means is arguably the most popular partitional clustering algorithm there is. The first K-Means based clustering algorithm to compute feature weights was designed just over 30 years ago. Various such algorithms have been designed since but there has not been, to our knowledge, a survey integrating empirical evidence of cluster recovery ability, common flaws, and possible directions for future research. This paper elaborates on the concept of feature weighting and addresses these issues by critically analysing some of the most popular, or innovative, feature weighting mechanisms based in K-Means."}
{"text": "  Traditional neural networks assume vectorial inputs as the network is arranged as layers of single line of computing units called neurons. This special structure requires the non-vectorial inputs such as matrices to be converted into vectors. This process can be problematic. Firstly, the spatial information among elements of the data may be lost during vectorisation. Secondly, the solution space becomes very large which demands very special treatments to the network parameters and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose matrix neural networks (MatNet), which takes matrices directly as inputs. Each neuron senses summarised information through bilinear mapping from lower layer units in exactly the same way as the classic feed forward neural networks. Under this structure, back prorogation and gradient descent combination can be utilised to obtain network parameters efficiently. Furthermore, it can be conveniently extended for multimodal inputs. We apply MatNet to MNIST handwritten digits classification and image super resolution tasks to show its effectiveness. Without too much tweaking MatNet achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art methods in both tasks with considerably reduced complexity."}
{"text": "  We study the K-armed dueling bandit problem which is a variation of the classical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem in which the learner receives only relative feedback about the selected pairs of arms. We propose a new algorithm called Relative Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (REX3) to handle the adversarial utility-based formulation of this problem. This algorithm is a non-trivial extension of the Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3) algorithm. We prove a finite time expected regret upper bound of order O(sqrt(K ln(K)T)) for this algorithm and a general lower bound of order omega(sqrt(KT)). At the end, we provide experimental results using real data from information retrieval applications."}
{"text": "  We show that the average stability notion introduced by \\cite{kearns1999algorithmic, bousquet2002stability} is invariant to data preconditioning, for a wide class of generalized linear models that includes most of the known exp-concave losses. In other words, when analyzing the stability rate of a given algorithm, we may assume the optimal preconditioning of the data. This implies that, at least from a statistical perspective, explicit regularization is not required in order to compensate for ill-conditioned data, which stands in contrast to a widely common approach that includes a regularization for analyzing the sample complexity of generalized linear models. Several important implications of our findings include: a) We demonstrate that the excess risk of empirical risk minimization (ERM) is controlled by the preconditioned stability rate. This immediately yields a relatively short and elegant proof for the fast rates attained by ERM in our context. b) We strengthen the recent bounds of \\cite{hardt2015train} on the stability rate of the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm."}
{"text": "  This work presents a new algorithm for training recurrent neural networks (although ideas are applicable to feedforward networks as well). The algorithm is derived from a theory in nonconvex optimization related to the diffusion equation. The contributions made in this work are two fold. First, we show how some seemingly disconnected mechanisms used in deep learning such as smart initialization, annealed learning rate, layerwise pretraining, and noise injection (as done in dropout and SGD) arise naturally and automatically from this framework, without manually crafting them into the algorithms. Second, we present some preliminary results on comparing the proposed method against SGD. It turns out that the new algorithm can achieve similar level of generalization accuracy of SGD in much fewer number of epochs."}
{"text": "  For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual's disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual's disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions--the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy."}
{"text": "  This paper presents the performance of a classifier built using the stackingC algorithm in nine different data sets. Each data set is generated using a sampling technique applied on the original imbalanced data set. Five new sampling techniques are proposed in this paper (i.e., SMOTERandRep, Lax Random Oversampling, Lax Random Undersampling, Combined-Lax Random Oversampling Undersampling, and Combined-Lax Random Undersampling Oversampling) that were based on the three sampling techniques (i.e., Random Undersampling, Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) usually used as solutions in imbalance learning. The metrics used to evaluate the classifier's performance were F-measure and G-mean. F-measure determines the performance of the classifier for every class, while G-mean measures the overall performance of the classifier. The results using F-measure showed that for the data without a sampling technique, the classifier's performance is good only for the majority class. It also showed that among the eight sampling techniques, RU and LRU have the worst performance while other techniques (i.e., RO, C-LRUO and C-LROU) performed well only on some classes. The best performing techniques in all data sets were SMOTE, SMOTERandRep, and LRO having the lowest F-measure values between 0.5 and 0.65. The results using G-mean showed that the oversampling technique that attained the highest G-mean value is LRO (0.86), next is C-LROU (0.85), then SMOTE (0.84) and finally is SMOTERandRep (0.83). Combining the result of the two metrics (F-measure and G-mean), only the three sampling techniques are considered as good performing (i.e., LRO, SMOTE, and SMOTERandRep)."}
{"text": "  We present a method of variable selection for the sparse generalized additive model. The method doesn't assume any specific functional form, and can select from a large number of candidates. It takes the form of incremental forward stagewise regression. Given no functional form is assumed, we devised an approach termed roughening to adjust the residuals in the iterations. In simulations, we show the new method is competitive against popular machine learning approaches. We also demonstrate its performance using some real datasets. The method is available as a part of the nlnet package on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=nlnet."}
{"text": "  Feature selection is a problem of finding efficient features among all features in which the final feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. In feature selection algorithms search strategies are key aspects. Since feature selection is an NP-Hard problem; therefore heuristic algorithms have been studied to solve this problem. In this paper, we have proposed a method based on memetic algorithm to find an efficient feature subset for a classification problem. It incorporates a filter method in the genetic algorithm to improve classification performance and accelerates the search in identifying core feature subsets. Particularly, the method adds or deletes a feature from a candidate feature subset based on the multivariate feature information. Empirical study on commonly data sets of the university of California, Irvine shows that the proposed method outperforms existing methods."}
{"text": "  Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is aimed at identifying a linear subspace such that the projected data follows a non-Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel NGCA algorithm based on log-density gradient estimation. Unlike existing methods, the proposed NGCA algorithm identifies the linear subspace by using the eigenvalue decomposition without any iterative procedures, and thus is computationally reasonable. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we prove that the identified subspace converges to the true subspace at the optimal parametric rate. Finally, the practical performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on both artificial and benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  Feature selection, as a data preprocessing strategy, has been proven to be effective and efficient in preparing data (especially high-dimensional data) for various data mining and machine learning problems. The objectives of feature selection include: building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity based, information theoretical based, sparse learning based and statistical based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open-source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (\\url{http://featureselection.asu.edu/}). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research."}
{"text": "  In Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem for sequence data, the instances inside the bags are sequences. In some real world applications such as bioinformatics, comparing a random couple of sequences makes no sense. In fact, each instance may have structural and/or functional relations with instances of other bags. Thus, the classification task should take into account this across bag relation. In this work, we present two novel MIL approaches for sequence data classification named ABClass and ABSim. ABClass extracts motifs from related instances and use them to encode sequences. A discriminative classifier is then applied to compute a partial classification result for each set of related sequences. ABSim uses a similarity measure to discriminate the related instances and to compute a scores matrix. For both approaches, an aggregation method is applied in order to generate the final classification result. We applied both approaches to solve the problem of bacterial Ionizing Radiation Resistance prediction. The experimental results of the presented approaches are satisfactory."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a new framework for manifold learning based on a sequence of principal polynomials that capture the possibly nonlinear nature of the data. The proposed Principal Polynomial Analysis (PPA) generalizes PCA by modeling the directions of maximal variance by means of curves, instead of straight lines. Contrarily to previous approaches, PPA reduces to performing simple univariate regressions, which makes it computationally feasible and robust. Moreover, PPA shows a number of interesting analytical properties. First, PPA is a volume-preserving map, which in turn guarantees the existence of the inverse. Second, such an inverse can be obtained in closed form. Invertibility is an important advantage over other learning methods, because it permits to understand the identified features in the input domain where the data has physical meaning. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the performance of dimensionality reduction in sensible (input-domain) units. Volume preservation also allows an easy computation of information theoretic quantities, such as the reduction in multi-information after the transform. Third, the analytical nature of PPA leads to a clear geometrical interpretation of the manifold: it allows the computation of Frenet-Serret frames (local features) and of generalized curvatures at any point of the space. And fourth, the analytical Jacobian allows the computation of the metric induced by the data, thus generalizing the Mahalanobis distance. These properties are demonstrated theoretically and illustrated experimentally. The performance of PPA is evaluated in dimensionality and redundancy reduction, in both synthetic and real datasets from the UCI repository."}
{"text": "  Most signal processing problems involve the challenging task of multidimensional probability density function (PDF) estimation. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a family of Rotation-based Iterative Gaussianization (RBIG) transforms. The general framework consists of the sequential application of a univariate marginal Gaussianization transform followed by an orthonormal transform. The proposed procedure looks for differentiable transforms to a known PDF so that the unknown PDF can be estimated at any point of the original domain. In particular, we aim at a zero mean unit covariance Gaussian for convenience. RBIG is formally similar to classical iterative Projection Pursuit (PP) algorithms. However, we show that, unlike in PP methods, the particular class of rotations used has no special qualitative relevance in this context, since looking for interestingness is not a critical issue for PDF estimation. The key difference is that our approach focuses on the univariate part (marginal Gaussianization) of the problem rather than on the multivariate part (rotation). This difference implies that one may select the most convenient rotation suited to each practical application. The differentiability, invertibility and convergence of RBIG are theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Relation to other methods, such as Radial Gaussianization (RG), one-class support vector domain description (SVDD), and deep neural networks (DNN) is also pointed out. The practical performance of RBIG is successfully illustrated in a number of multidimensional problems such as image synthesis, classification, denoising, and multi-information estimation."}
{"text": "  Generating user interpretable multi-class predictions in data rich environments with many classes and explanatory covariates is a daunting task. We introduce Diagonal Orthant Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DOLDA), a supervised topic model for multi-class classification that can handle both many classes as well as many covariates. To handle many classes we use the recently proposed Diagonal Orthant (DO) probit model (Johndrow et al., 2013) together with an efficient Horseshoe prior for variable selection/shrinkage (Carvalho et al., 2010). We propose a computationally efficient parallel Gibbs sampler for the new model. An important advantage of DOLDA is that learned topics are directly connected to individual classes without the need for a reference class. We evaluate the model's predictive accuracy on two datasets and demonstrate DOLDA's advantage in interpreting the generated predictions."}

{"text": "  Learning for maximizing AUC performance is an important research problem in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Unlike traditional batch learning methods for maximizing AUC which often suffer from poor scalability, recent years have witnessed some emerging studies that attempt to maximize AUC by single-pass online learning approaches. Despite their encouraging results reported, the existing online AUC maximization algorithms often adopt simple online gradient descent approaches that fail to exploit the geometrical knowledge of the data observed during the online learning process, and thus could suffer from relatively larger regret. To address the above limitation, in this work, we explore a novel algorithm of Adaptive Online AUC Maximization (AdaOAM) which employs an adaptive gradient method that exploits the knowledge of historical gradients to perform more informative online learning. The new adaptive updating strategy of the AdaOAM is less sensitive to the parameter settings and maintains the same time complexity as previous non-adaptive counterparts. Additionally, we extend the algorithm to handle high-dimensional sparse data (SAdaOAM) and address sparsity in the solution by performing lazy gradient updating. We analyze the theoretical bounds and evaluate their empirical performance on various types of data sets. The encouraging empirical results obtained clearly highlighted the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "  Traditionally, practitioners initialize the {\\tt k-means} algorithm with centers chosen uniformly at random. Randomized initialization with uneven weights ({\\tt k-means++}) has recently been used to improve the performance over this strategy in cost and run-time. We consider the k-means problem with semi-supervised information, where some of the data are pre-labeled, and we seek to label the rest according to the minimum cost solution. By extending the {\\tt k-means++} algorithm and analysis to account for the labels, we derive an improved theoretical bound on expected cost and observe improved performance in simulated and real data examples. This analysis provides theoretical justification for a roughly linear semi-supervised clustering algorithm."}
{"text": "  Breast cancer screening policies attempt to achieve timely diagnosis by the regular screening of apparently healthy women. Various clinical decisions are needed to manage the screening process; those include: selecting the screening tests for a woman to take, interpreting the test outcomes, and deciding whether or not a woman should be referred to a diagnostic test. Such decisions are currently guided by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which represent a one-size-fits-all approach that are designed to work well on average for a population, without guaranteeing that it will work well uniformly over that population. Since the risks and benefits of screening are functions of each patients features, personalized screening policies that are tailored to the features of individuals are needed in order to ensure that the right tests are recommended to the right woman. In order to address this issue, we present ConfidentCare: a computer-aided clinical decision support system that learns a personalized screening policy from the electronic health record (EHR) data. ConfidentCare operates by recognizing clusters of similar patients, and learning the best screening policy to adopt for each cluster. A cluster of patients is a set of patients with similar features (e.g. age, breast density, family history, etc.), and the screening policy is a set of guidelines on what actions to recommend for a woman given her features and screening test scores. ConfidentCare algorithm ensures that the policy adopted for every cluster of patients satisfies a predefined accuracy requirement with a high level of confidence. We show that our algorithm outperforms the current CPGs in terms of cost-efficiency and false positive rates."}
{"text": "  We propose graph-based predictable feature analysis (GPFA), a new method for unsupervised learning of predictable features from high-dimensional time series, where high predictability is understood very generically as low variance in the distribution of the next data point given the previous ones. We show how this measure of predictability can be understood in terms of graph embedding as well as how it relates to the information-theoretic measure of predictive information in special cases. We confirm the effectiveness of GPFA on different datasets, comparing it to three existing algorithms with similar objectives---namely slow feature analysis, forecastable component analysis, and predictable feature analysis---to which GPFA shows very competitive results."}
{"text": "  Consider designing an effective crowdsourcing system for an $M$-ary classification task. Crowd workers complete simple binary microtasks whose results are aggregated to give the final result. We consider the novel scenario where workers have a reject option so they may skip microtasks when they are unable or choose not to respond. For example, in mismatched speech transcription, workers who do not know the language may not be able to respond to microtasks focused on phonological dimensions outside their categorical perception. We present an aggregation approach using a weighted majority voting rule, where each worker's response is assigned an optimized weight to maximize the crowd's classification performance. We evaluate system performance in both exact and asymptotic forms. Further, we consider the setting where there may be a set of greedy workers that complete microtasks even when they are unable to perform it reliably. We consider an oblivious and an expurgation strategy to deal with greedy workers, developing an algorithm to adaptively switch between the two based on the estimated fraction of greedy workers in the anonymous crowd. Simulation results show improved performance compared with conventional majority voting."}
{"text": "  We consider learning representations (features) in the setting in which we have access to multiple unlabeled views of the data for learning while only one view is available for downstream tasks. Previous work on this problem has proposed several techniques based on deep neural networks, typically involving either autoencoder-like networks with a reconstruction objective or paired feedforward networks with a batch-style correlation-based objective. We analyze several techniques based on prior work, as well as new variants, and compare them empirically on image, speech, and text tasks. We find an advantage for correlation-based representation learning, while the best results on most tasks are obtained with our new variant, deep canonically correlated autoencoders (DCCAE). We also explore a stochastic optimization procedure for minibatch correlation-based objectives and discuss the time/performance trade-offs for kernel-based and neural network-based implementations."}
{"text": "  Regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), proposed by Friedman (1989), is a widely popular classifier that lacks interpretability and is impractical for high-dimensional data sets. Here, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient classifier called high-dimensional RDA (HDRDA), designed for the small-sample, high-dimensional setting. For HDRDA, we show that each training observation, regardless of class, contributes to the class covariance matrix, resulting in an interpretable estimator that borrows from the pooled sample covariance matrix. Moreover, we show that HDRDA is equivalent to a classifier in a reduced-feature space with dimension approximately equal to the training sample size. As a result, the matrix operations employed by HDRDA are computationally linear in the number of features, making the classifier well-suited for high-dimensional classification in practice. We demonstrate that HDRDA is often superior to several sparse and regularized classifiers in terms of classification accuracy with three artificial and six real high-dimensional data sets. Also, timing comparisons between our HDRDA implementation in the sparsediscrim R package and the standard RDA formulation in the klaR R package demonstrate that as the number of features increases, the computational runtime of HDRDA is drastically smaller than that of RDA."}
{"text": "  k-means++ seeding has become a de facto standard for hard clustering algorithms. In this paper, our first contribution is a two-way generalisation of this seeding, k-variates++, that includes the sampling of general densities rather than just a discrete set of Dirac densities anchored at the point locations, and a generalisation of the well known Arthur-Vassilvitskii (AV) approximation guarantee, in the form of a bias+variance approximation bound of the global optimum. This approximation exhibits a reduced dependency on the \"noise\" component with respect to the optimal potential --- actually approaching the statistical lower bound. We show that k-variates++ reduces to efficient (biased seeding) clustering algorithms tailored to specific frameworks; these include distributed, streaming and on-line clustering, with direct approximation results for these algorithms. Finally, we present a novel application of k-variates++ to differential privacy. For either the specific frameworks considered here, or for the differential privacy setting, there is little to no prior results on the direct application of k-means++ and its approximation bounds --- state of the art contenders appear to be significantly more complex and / or display less favorable (approximation) properties. We stress that our algorithms can still be run in cases where there is \\textit{no} closed form solution for the population minimizer. We demonstrate the applicability of our analysis via experimental evaluation on several domains and settings, displaying competitive performances vs state of the art."}
{"text": "  The text-critical practice of grouping witnesses into families or texttypes often faces two obstacles: Contamination in the manuscript tradition, and co-dependence in identifying characteristic readings and manuscripts. We introduce non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a simple, unsupervised, and efficient way to cluster large numbers of manuscripts and readings simultaneously while summarizing contamination using an easy-to-interpret mixture model. We apply this method to an extensive collation of the New Testament epistle of Jude and show that the resulting clusters correspond to human-identified textual families from existing research."}
{"text": "  Hearing Aid (HA) algorithms need to be tuned (\"fitted\") to match the impairment of each specific patient. The lack of a fundamental HA fitting theory is a strong contributing factor to an unsatisfying sound experience for about 20% of hearing aid patients. This paper proposes a probabilistic modeling approach to the design of HA algorithms. The proposed method relies on a generative probabilistic model for the hearing loss problem and provides for automated inference of the corresponding (1) signal processing algorithm, (2) the fitting solution as well as a principled (3) performance evaluation metric. All three tasks are realized as message passing algorithms in a factor graph representation of the generative model, which in principle allows for fast implementation on hearing aid or mobile device hardware. The methods are theoretically worked out and simulated with a custom-built factor graph toolbox for a specific hearing loss model."}
{"text": "  We consider planning problems, that often arise in autonomous driving applications, in which an agent should decide on immediate actions so as to optimize a long term objective. For example, when a car tries to merge in a roundabout it should decide on an immediate acceleration/braking command, while the long term effect of the command is the success/failure of the merge. Such problems are characterized by continuous state and action spaces, and by interaction with multiple agents, whose behavior can be adversarial. We argue that dual versions of the MDP framework (that depend on the value function and the $Q$ function) are problematic for autonomous driving applications due to the non Markovian of the natural state space representation, and due to the continuous state and action spaces. We propose to tackle the planning task by decomposing the problem into two phases: First, we apply supervised learning for predicting the near future based on the present. We require that the predictor will be differentiable with respect to the representation of the present. Second, we model a full trajectory of the agent using a recurrent neural network, where unexplained factors are modeled as (additive) input nodes. This allows us to solve the long-term planning problem using supervised learning techniques and direct optimization over the recurrent neural network. Our approach enables us to learn robust policies by incorporating adversarial elements to the environment."}
{"text": "  Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent is a popular method for solving regularized loss minimization for the case of convex losses. We describe variants of SDCA that do not require explicit regularization and do not rely on duality. We prove linear convergence rates even if individual loss functions are non-convex, as long as the expected loss is strongly convex."}
{"text": "  A commonly used learning rule is to approximately minimize the \\emph{average} loss over the training set. Other learning algorithms, such as AdaBoost and hard-SVM, aim at minimizing the \\emph{maximal} loss over the training set. The average loss is more popular, particularly in deep learning, due to three main reasons. First, it can be conveniently minimized using online algorithms, that process few examples at each iteration. Second, it is often argued that there is no sense to minimize the loss on the training set too much, as it will not be reflected in the generalization loss. Last, the maximal loss is not robust to outliers. In this paper we describe and analyze an algorithm that can convert any online algorithm to a minimizer of the maximal loss. We prove that in some situations better accuracy on the training set is crucial to obtain good performance on unseen examples. Last, we propose robust versions of the approach that can handle outliers."}
{"text": "  In the last five years there have been a large number of new time series classification algorithms proposed in the literature. These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only 9 of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the Collective of Transformation Ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more rigorous testing of new algorithms in the future."}
{"text": "  We propose a conceptually simple and lightweight framework for deep reinforcement learning that uses asynchronous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers. We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input."}
{"text": "  Clustering is one of the most fundamental and important tasks in data mining. Traditional clustering algorithms, such as K-means, assign every data point to exactly one cluster. However, in real-world datasets, the clusters may overlap with each other. Furthermore, often, there are outliers that should not belong to any cluster. We recently proposed the NEO-K-Means (Non-Exhaustive, Overlapping K-Means) objective as a way to address both issues in an integrated fashion. Optimizing this discrete objective is NP-hard, and even though there is a convex relaxation of the objective, straightforward convex optimization approaches are too expensive for large datasets. A practical alternative is to use a low-rank factorization of the solution matrix in the convex formulation. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex, and we can locally optimize the objective function using an augmented Lagrangian method. In this paper, we consider two fast multiplier methods to accelerate the convergence of an augmented Lagrangian scheme: a proximal method of multipliers and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). For the proximal augmented Lagrangian or proximal method of multipliers, we show a convergence result for the non-convex case with bound-constrained subproblems. These methods are up to 13 times faster---with no change in quality---compared with a standard augmented Lagrangian method on problems with over 10,000 variables and bring runtimes down from over an hour to around 5 minutes."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel framework for an approxi- mate recovery of data matrices which are low-rank on graphs, from sampled measurements. The rows and columns of such matrices belong to the span of the first few eigenvectors of the graphs constructed between their rows and columns. We leverage this property to recover the non-linear low-rank structures efficiently from sampled data measurements, with a low cost (linear in n). First, a Resrtricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition is introduced for efficient uniform sampling of the rows and columns of such matrices based on the cumulative coherence of graph eigenvectors. Secondly, a state-of-the-art fast low-rank recovery method is suggested for the sampled data. Finally, several efficient, parallel and parameter-free decoders are presented along with their theoretical analysis for decoding the low-rank and cluster indicators for the full data matrix. Thus, we overcome the computational limitations of the standard linear low-rank recovery methods for big datasets. Our method can also be seen as a major step towards efficient recovery of non- linear low-rank structures. For a matrix of size n X p, on a single core machine, our method gains a speed up of $p^2/k$ over Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), where k << p is the subspace dimension. Numerically, we can recover a low-rank matrix of size 10304 X 1000, 100 times faster than Robust PCA."}
{"text": "  The Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm has recently regained popularity for machine learning applications due to its projection-free property and its ability to handle structured constraints. However, in the stochastic learning setting, it is still relatively understudied compared to the gradient descent counterpart. In this work, leveraging a recent variance reduction technique, we propose two stochastic Frank-Wolfe variants which substantially improve previous results in terms of the number of stochastic gradient evaluations needed to achieve $1-\\epsilon$ accuracy. For example, we improve from $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ to $O(\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ if the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, and from $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$ to $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{1.5}})$ if the objective function is smooth and Lipschitz. The theoretical improvement is also observed in experiments on real-world datasets for a multiclass classification application."}
{"text": "  The proliferation of sensor devices monitoring human activity generates voluminous amount of temporal sequences needing to be interpreted and categorized. Moreover, complex behavior detection requires the personalization of multi-sensor fusion algorithms. Conditional random fields (CRFs) are commonly used in structured prediction tasks such as part-of-speech tagging in natural language processing. Conditional probabilities guide the choice of each tag/label in the sequence conflating the structured prediction task with the sequence classification task where different models provide different categorization of the same sequence. The claim of this paper is that CRF models also provide discriminative models to distinguish between types of sequence regardless of the accuracy of the labels obtained if we calibrate the class membership estimate of the sequence. We introduce and compare different neural network based linear-chain CRFs and we present experiments on two complex sequence classification and structured prediction tasks to support this claim."}
{"text": "  We propose Sketched Online Newton (SON), an online second order learning algorithm that enjoys substantially improved regret guarantees for ill-conditioned data. SON is an enhanced version of the Online Newton Step, which, via sketching techniques enjoys a running time linear in the dimension and sketch size. We further develop sparse forms of the sketching methods (such as Oja's rule), making the computation linear in the sparsity of features. Together, the algorithm eliminates all computational obstacles in previous second order online learning approaches."}
{"text": "  We develop a novel preconditioning method for ridge regression, based on recent linear sketching methods.

{"text": "  We provide the first oracle efficient sublinear regret algorithms for adversarial versions of the contextual bandit problem. In this problem, the learner repeatedly makes an action on the basis of a context and receives reward for the chosen action, with the goal of achieving reward competitive with a large class of policies. We analyze two settings: i) in the transductive setting the learner knows the set of contexts a priori, ii) in the small separator setting, there exists a small set of contexts such that any two policies behave differently in one of the contexts in the set. Our algorithms fall into the follow the perturbed leader family \\cite{Kalai2005} and achieve regret $O(T^{3/4}\\sqrt{K\\log(N)})$ in the transductive setting and $O(T^{2/3} d^{3/4} K\\sqrt{\\log(N)})$ in the separator setting, where $K$ is the number of actions, $N$ is the number of baseline policies, and $d$ is the size of the separator. We actually solve the more general adversarial contextual semi-bandit linear optimization problem, whilst in the full information setting we address the even more general contextual combinatorial optimization. We provide several extensions and implications of our algorithms, such as switching regret and efficient learning with predictable sequences."}
{"text": "  The problem of learning a sparse model is conceptually interpreted as the process of identifying active features/samples and then optimizing the model over them. Recently introduced safe screening allows us to identify a part of non-active features/samples. So far, safe screening has been individually studied either for feature screening or for sample screening. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for safely screening features and samples simultaneously by alternatively iterating feature and sample screening steps. A significant advantage of considering them simultaneously rather than individually is that they have a synergy effect in the sense that the results of the previous safe feature screening can be exploited for improving the next safe sample screening performances, and vice-versa. We first theoretically investigate the synergy effect, and then illustrate the practical advantage through intensive numerical experiments for problems with large numbers of features and samples."}
{"text": "  We introduce a method to train Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) - neural networks with binary weights and activations at run-time. At training-time the binary weights and activations are used for computing the parameters gradients. During the forward pass, BNNs drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations, which is expected to substantially improve power-efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of BNNs we conduct two sets of experiments on the Torch7 and Theano frameworks. On both, BNNs achieved nearly state-of-the-art results over the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. Last but not least, we wrote a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST BNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification accuracy. The code for training and running our BNNs is available on-line."}
{"text": "  Machine learning based computational intelligence methods are widely used to analyze large scale data sets in this age of big data. Extracting useful predictive modeling from these types of data sets is a challenging problem due to their high complexity. Analyzing large amount of streaming data that can be leveraged to derive business value is another complex problem to solve. With high levels of data availability (\\textit{i.e. Big Data}) automatic classification of them has become an important and complex task. Hence, we explore the power of applying MapReduce based Distributed AdaBoosting of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to build a predictive bag of classification models. Accordingly, (i) data set ensembles are created; (ii) ELM algorithm is used to build weak learners (classifier functions); and (iii) builds a strong learner from a set of weak learners. We applied this training model to the benchmark knowledge discovery and data mining data sets."}
{"text": "  In machine learning area, as the number of labeled input samples becomes very large, it is very difficult to build a classification model because of input data set is not fit in a memory in training phase of the algorithm, therefore, it is necessary to utilize data partitioning to handle overall data set. Bagging and boosting based data partitioning methods have been broadly used in data mining and pattern recognition area. Both of these methods have shown a great possibility for improving classification model performance. This study is concerned with the analysis of data set partitioning with noise removal and its impact on the performance of multiple classifier models. In this study, we propose noise filtering preprocessing at each data set partition to increment classifier model performance. We applied Gini impurity approach to find the best split percentage of noise filter ratio. The filtered sub data set is then used to train individual ensemble models."}
{"text": "  We propose a nonparametric statistical test for goodness-of-fit: given a set of samples, the test determines how likely it is that these were generated from a target density function. The measure of goodness-of-fit is a divergence constructed via Stein's method using functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our test statistic is based on an empirical estimate of this divergence, taking the form of a V-statistic in terms of the log gradients of the target density and the kernel. We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure. We apply our test to quantifying convergence of approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, statistical model criticism, and evaluating quality of fit vs model complexity in nonparametric density estimation."}
{"text": "  We present the Structured Weighted Violations Perceptron (SWVP) algorithm, a new structured prediction algorithm that generalizes the Collins Structured Perceptron (CSP). Unlike CSP, the update rule of SWVP explicitly exploits the internal structure of the predicted labels. We prove the convergence of SWVP for linearly separable training sets, provide mistake and generalization bounds, and show that in the general case these bounds are tighter than those of the CSP special case. In synthetic data experiments with data drawn from an HMM, various variants of SWVP substantially outperform its CSP special case. SWVP also provides encouraging initial dependency parsing results."}
{"text": "  Unsupervised image segmentation aims at clustering the set of pixels of an image into spatially homogeneous regions. We introduce here a class of Bayesian nonparametric models to address this problem. These models are based on a combination of a Potts-like spatial smoothness component and a prior on partitions which is used to control both the number and size of clusters. This class of models is flexible enough to include the standard Potts model and the more recent Potts-Dirichlet Process model \\cite{Orbanz2008}. More importantly, any prior on partitions can be introduced to control the global clustering structure so that it is possible to penalize small or large clusters if necessary. Bayesian computation is carried out using an original generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive in terms of RAND\\ index compared to popular image segmentation methods, such as mean-shift, and recent alternative Bayesian nonparametric models."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel memory architecture for neural networks called Hierarchical Attentive Memory (HAM). It is based on a binary tree with leaves corresponding to memory cells. This allows HAM to perform memory access in O(log n) complexity, which is a significant improvement over the standard attention mechanism that requires O(n) operations, where n is the size of the memory.   We show that an LSTM network augmented with HAM can learn algorithms for problems like merging, sorting or binary searching from pure input-output examples. In particular, it learns to sort n numbers in time O(n log n) and generalizes well to input sequences much longer than the ones seen during the training. We also show that HAM can be trained to act like classic data structures: a stack, a FIFO queue and a priority queue."}
{"text": "  We derive a new discrepancy statistic for measuring differences between two probability distributions based on combining Stein's identity with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. We apply our result to test how well a probabilistic model fits a set of observations, and derive a new class of powerful goodness-of-fit tests that are widely applicable for complex and high dimensional distributions, even for those with computationally intractable normalization constants. Both theoretical and empirical properties of our methods are studied thoroughly."}
{"text": "  Clustering is a powerful tool in data analysis, but it is often difficult to find a grouping that aligns with a user's needs. To address this, several methods incorporate constraints obtained from users into clustering algorithms, but unfortunately do not apply to hierarchical clustering. We design an interactive Bayesian algorithm that incorporates user interaction into hierarchical clustering while still utilizing the geometry of the data by sampling a constrained posterior distribution over hierarchies. We also suggest several ways to intelligently query a user. The algorithm, along with the querying schemes, shows promising results on real data."}
{"text": "  Recently, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods have been proposed for scaling up Monte Carlo computations to large data problems. Whilst these approaches have proven useful in many applications, vanilla SG-MCMC might suffer from poor mixing rates when random variables exhibit strong couplings under the target densities or big scale differences. In this study, we propose a novel SG-MCMC method that takes the local geometry into account by using ideas from Quasi-Newton optimization methods. These second order methods directly approximate the inverse Hessian by using a limited history of samples and their gradients. Our method uses dense approximations of the inverse Hessian while keeping the time and memory complexities linear with the dimension of the problem. We provide a formal theoretical analysis where we show that the proposed method is asymptotically unbiased and consistent with the posterior expectations. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach on both synthetic and real datasets. Our experiments on two challenging applications show that our method achieves fast convergence rates similar to Riemannian approaches while at the same time having low computational requirements similar to diagonal preconditioning approaches."}
{"text": "  Extracting the underlying low-dimensional space where high-dimensional signals often reside has long been at the center of numerous algorithms in the signal processing and machine learning literature during the past few decades. At the same time, working with incomplete (partly observed) large scale datasets has recently been commonplace for diverse reasons. This so called {\\it big data era} we are currently living calls for devising online subspace learning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data. Their envisaged objective is to {\\it recursively} estimate the unknown subspace by processing streaming data sequentially, thus reducing computational complexity, while obviating the need for storing the whole dataset in memory. In this paper, an online variational Bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations is presented. To account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace, commonly met in practice, low-rankness is explicitly imposed on the sought subspace data matrix by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning principles. Moreover, sparsity, {\\it simultaneously} to low-rankness, is favored on the subspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian scheme that is adopted. In doing so, the proposed algorithm becomes adept in dealing with applications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse, as, e.g., in sparse dictionary learning problems. As shown, the new subspace tracking scheme outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy, in a variety of experiments conducted on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "  The mixture of experts (MoE) model is a popular neural network architecture for nonlinear regression and classification. The class of MoE mean functions is known to be uniformly convergent to any unknown target function, assuming that the target function is from Sobolev space that is sufficiently differentiable and that the domain of estimation is a compact unit hypercube. We provide an alternative result, which shows that the class of MoE mean functions is dense in the class of all continuous functions over arbitrary compact domains of estimation. Our result can be viewed as a universal approximation theorem for MoE models."}
{"text": "  We use random geometric graphs to describe clusters of higher dimensional data points which are bijectively mapped to a (possibly) lower dimensional space where an equivalent random cluster model is used to calculate the expected number of modes to be found when separating the data of a multi-modal data set into distinct clusters. Furthermore, as a function of the expected number of modes and the number of data points in the sample, an upper bound on a given distance measure is found such that data points have the greatest correlation if their mutual distances from a common center is less than or equal to the calculated bound. Anomalies are exposed, which lie outside of the union of all regularized clusters of data points.   Similar to finding a hyperplane which can be shifted along its normal to expose the maximal distance between binary classes, it is shown that the union of regularized clusters can be used to define a hyperplane which can be shifted by a certain amount to separate the data into binary classes and that the shifted hyperplane defines the activation function for a two-class discriminating neural network. Lastly, this neural network is used to detect the set of support vectors which determines the maximally-separating region between the binary classes."}
{"text": "  In the recent years, a number of parameter-free algorithms have been developed for online linear optimization over Hilbert spaces and for learning with expert advice. These algorithms achieve optimal regret bounds that depend on the unknown competitors, without having to tune the learning rates with oracle choices.   We present a new intuitive framework to design parameter-free algorithms for \\emph{both} online linear optimization over Hilbert spaces and for learning with expert advice, based on reductions to betting on outcomes of adversarial coins. We instantiate it using a betting algorithm based on the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator. The resulting algorithms are simple, with no parameters to be tuned, and they improve or match previous results in terms of regret guarantee and per-round complexity."}
{"text": "  Speaker identification refers to the task of localizing the face of a person who has the same identity as the ongoing voice in a video. This task not only requires collective perception over both visual and auditory signals, the robustness to handle severe quality degradations and unconstrained content variations are also indispensable. In this paper, we describe a novel multimodal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture which seamlessly unifies both visual and auditory modalities from the beginning of each sequence input. The key idea is to extend the conventional LSTM by not only sharing weights across time steps, but also sharing weights across modalities. We show that modeling the temporal dependency across face and voice can significantly improve the robustness to content quality degradations and variations. We also found that our multimodal LSTM is robustness to distractors, namely the non-speaking identities. We applied our multimodal LSTM to The Big Bang Theory dataset and showed that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems in speaker identification with lower false alarm rate and higher recognition accuracy."}

For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. In this paper, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep networks that can jointly learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. We relax a shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. We enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into deep network to explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier. We fuse features of multiple layers with tensor product and embed them into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to match distributions for feature adaptation. The adaptation can be achieved in most feed-forward models by extending them with new residual layers and loss functions, which can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Empirical evidence shows that the new approach outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks."}
{"text": "  In this paper we study predictive pattern mining problems where the goal is to construct a predictive model based on a subset of predictive patterns in the database. Our main contribution is to introduce a novel method called safe pattern pruning (SPP) for a class of predictive pattern mining problems. The SPP method allows us to efficiently find a superset of all the predictive patterns in the database that are needed for the optimal predictive model. The advantage of the SPP method over existing boosting-type method is that the former can find the superset by a single search over the database, while the latter requires multiple searches. The SPP method is inspired by recent development of safe feature screening. In order to extend the idea of safe feature screening into predictive pattern mining, we derive a novel pruning rule called safe pattern pruning (SPP) rule that can be used for searching over the tree defined among patterns in the database. The SPP rule has a property that, if a node corresponding to a pattern in the database is pruned out by the SPP rule, then it is guaranteed that all the patterns corresponding to its descendant nodes are never needed for the optimal predictive model. We apply the SPP method to graph mining and item-set mining problems, and demonstrate its computational advantage."}
{"text": "  Discovering statistically significant patterns from databases is an important challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in databases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically significant patterns from databases."}
{"text": "  We study networks of communicating learning agents that cooperate to solve a common nonstochastic bandit problem. Agents use an underlying communication network to get messages about actions selected by other agents, and drop messages that took more than $d$ hops to arrive, where $d$ is a delay parameter. We introduce \\textsc{Exp3-Coop}, a cooperative version of the {\\sc Exp3} algorithm and prove that with $K$ actions and $N$ agents the average per-agent regret after $T$ rounds is at most of order $\\sqrt{\\bigl(d+1 + \\tfrac{K}{N}\\alpha_{\\le d}\\bigr)(T\\ln K)}$, where $\\alpha_{\\le d}$ is the independence number of the $d$-th power of the connected communication graph $G$. We then show that for any connected graph, for $d=\\sqrt{K}$ the regret bound is $K^{1/4}\\sqrt{T}$, strictly better than the minimax regret $\\sqrt{KT}$ for noncooperating agents. More informed choices of $d$ lead to bounds which are arbitrarily close to the full information minimax regret $\\sqrt{T\\ln K}$ when $G$ is dense. When $G$ has sparse components, we show that a variant of \\textsc{Exp3-Coop}, allowing agents to choose their parameters according to their centrality in $G$, strictly improves the regret. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we provide the first characterization of the minimax regret for bandit learning with delay."}
{"text": "  Circular variables arise in a multitude of data-modelling contexts ranging from robotics to the social sciences, but they have been largely overlooked by the machine learning community. This paper partially redresses this imbalance by extending some standard probabilistic modelling tools to the circular domain. First we introduce a new multivariate distribution over circular variables, called the multivariate Generalised von Mises (mGvM) distribution. This distribution can be constructed by restricting and renormalising a general multivariate Gaussian distribution to the unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed multivariate circular distributions are shown to be special cases of this construction. Second, we introduce a new probabilistic model for circular regression, that is inspired by Gaussian Processes, and a method for probabilistic principal component analysis with circular hidden variables. These models can leverage standard modelling tools (e.g. covariance functions and methods for automatic relevance determination). Third, we show that the posterior distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution which enables development of an efficient variational free-energy scheme for performing approximate inference and approximate maximum-likelihood learning."}
{"text": "  Over the past decade the rate of care unit (CU) use in the United States has been increasing. With an aging population and ever-growing demand for medical care, effective management of patients' transitions among different care facilities will prove indispensible for shortening the length of hospital stays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical care resources, and reducing preventable re-admissions. In this paper, we focus on an important problem of predicting the so-called \"patient flow\" from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), which has not been explored via existing machine learning techniques. By treating a sequence of transition events as a point process, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various CUs and jointly predicting patients' destination CUs and duration days. Instead of learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the prediction of transition events in the case of sparse data. By parameterizing the proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the estimation problem via generalized linear models, which lends itself to efficient learning based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a group-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm. Additionally, for suppressing the negative influence of data imbalance on the learning of model, we synthesize auxiliary training data for the classes with extremely few samples, and improve the robustness of our learning method accordingly. Testing on real-world data, we show that our method obtains superior performance in terms of accuracy of predicting the destination CU transition and duration of each CU occupancy."}
{"text": "  We present a new perspective on graph-based methods for collaborative ranking for recommender systems. Unlike user-based or item-based methods that compute a weighted average of ratings given by the nearest neighbors, or low-rank approximation methods using convex optimization and the nuclear norm, we formulate matrix completion as a series of semi-supervised learning problems, and propagate the known ratings to the missing ones on the user-user or item-item graph globally. The semi-supervised learning problems are expressed as Laplace-Beltrami equations on a manifold, or namely, harmonic extension, and can be discretized by a point integral method. We show that our approach does not impose a low-rank Euclidean subspace on the data points, but instead minimizes the dimension of the underlying manifold. Our method, named LDM (low dimensional manifold), turns out to be particularly effective in generating rankings of items, showing decent computational efficiency and robust ranking quality compared to state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning framework for energy-based models. It involves only one kind of neural computation, performed in both the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase of training (after the target or prediction error is revealed). Although this algorithm computes the gradient of an objective function just like Backpropagation, it does not need a special computation or circuit for the second phase, where errors are implicitly propagated. Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point, or stationary distribution) towards a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged towards their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal 'back-propagated' during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not."}
{"text": "  Datasets are growing not just in size but in complexity, creating a demand for rich models and quantification of uncertainty. Bayesian methods are an excellent fit for this demand, but scaling Bayesian inference is a challenge. In response to this challenge, there has been considerable recent work based on varying assumptions about model structure, underlying computational resources, and the importance of asymptotic correctness. As a result, there is a zoo of ideas with few clear overarching principles.   In this paper, we seek to identify unifying principles, patterns, and intuitions for scaling Bayesian inference. We review existing work on utilizing modern computing resources with both MCMC and variational approximation techniques. From this taxonomy of ideas, we characterize the general principles that have proven successful for designing scalable inference procedures and comment on the path forward."}
{"text": "  A reproducing kernel can define an embedding of a data point into an infinite dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The norm in this space describes a distance, which we call the kernel distance. The random Fourier features (of Rahimi and Recht) describe an oblivious approximate mapping into finite dimensional Euclidean space that behaves similar to the RKHS. We show in this paper that for the Gaussian kernel the Euclidean norm between these mapped to features has $(1+\\epsilon)$-relative error with respect to the kernel distance. When there are $n$ data points, we show that $O((1/\\epsilon^2) \\log(n))$ dimensions of the approximate feature space are sufficient and necessary.   Without a bound on $n$, but when the original points lie in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and have diameter bounded by $\\mathcal{M}$, then we show that $O((d/\\epsilon^2) \\log(\\mathcal{M}))$ dimensions are sufficient, and that this many are required, up to $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ factors."}
{"text": "  To the best of our knowledge, there are no general well-founded robust methods for statistical unsupervised learning. Most of the unsupervised methods explicitly or implicitly depend on the kernel covariance operator (kernel CO) or kernel cross-covariance operator (kernel CCO). They are sensitive to contaminated data, even when using bounded positive definite kernels. First, we propose robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and robust kernel crosscovariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we propose influence function of classical kernel canonical correlation analysis (classical kernel CCA). Third, using this influence function, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method based on robust kernel CO and robust kernel CCO, called robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel methods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO. Experiments on synthesized and imaging genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed visualization and robust kernel CCA can be applied effectively to both ideal data and contaminated data. The robust methods show the superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  Learning efficient representations for concepts has been proven to be an important basis for many applications such as machine translation or document classification. Proper representations of medical concepts such as diagnosis, medication, procedure codes and visits will have broad applications in healthcare analytics. However, in Electronic Health Records (EHR) the visit sequences of patients include multiple concepts (diagnosis, procedure, and medication codes) per visit. This structure provides two types of relational information, namely sequential order of visits and co-occurrence of the codes within each visit. In this work, we propose Med2Vec, which not only learns distributed representations for both medical codes and visits from a large EHR dataset with over 3 million visits, but also allows us to interpret the learned representations confirmed positively by clinical experts. In the experiments, Med2Vec displays significant improvement in key medical applications compared to popular baselines such as Skip-gram, GloVe and stacked autoencoder, while providing clinically meaningful interpretation."}
{"text": "  Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning.   We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent."}
{"text": "  Sampling with replacement occurs in many settings in machine learning, notably in the bagging ensemble technique and the .632+ validation scheme. The number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample can have an important role in the behaviour of prediction models learned on it. Indeed, there are uncontrived examples where duplicate items have no effect. The purpose of this report is to present the distribution of the number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample clearly and concisely, with a view to enabling other machine learning researchers to understand and control this quantity in existing and future resampling techniques. We describe the key characteristics of this distribution along with the generalisation for the case where items come from distinct categories, as in classification. In both cases we discuss the normal limit, and conduct an empirical investigation to derive a heuristic for when a normal approximation is permissible."}
{"text": "  We show a Talagrand-type concentration inequality for Multi-Task Learning (MTL), using which we establish sharp excess risk bounds for MTL in terms of distribution- and data-dependent versions of the Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC). We also give a new bound on the LRC for norm regularized as well as strongly convex hypothesis classes, which applies not only to MTL but also to the standard i.i.d. setting. Combining both results, one can now easily derive fast-rate bounds on the excess risk for many prominent MTL methods, including---as we demonstrate---Schatten-norm, group-norm, and graph-regularized MTL. The derived bounds reflect a relationship akeen to a conservation law of asymptotic convergence rates. This very relationship allows for trading off slower rates w.r.t. the number of tasks for faster rates with respect to the number of available samples per task, when compared to the rates obtained via a traditional, global Rademacher analysis."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we revise two commonly used saturated functions, the logistic sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh).   We point out that, besides the well-known non-zero centered property, slope of the activation function near the origin is another possible reason making training deep networks with the logistic function difficult to train. We demonstrate that, with proper rescaling, the logistic sigmoid achieves comparable results with tanh.   Then following the same argument, we improve tahn by penalizing in the negative part. We show that \"penalized tanh\" is comparable and even outperforms the state-of-the-art non-saturated functions including ReLU and leaky ReLU on deep convolution neural networks.   Our results contradict to the conclusion of previous works that the saturation property causes the slow convergence. It suggests further investigation is necessary to better understand activation functions in deep architectures."}
{"text": "  Dynamic topic models (DTMs) are very effective in discovering topics and capturing their evolution trends in time series data. To do posterior inference of DTMs, existing methods are all batch algorithms that scan the full dataset before each update of the model and make inexact variational approximations with mean-field assumptions. Due to a lack of a more scalable inference algorithm, despite the usefulness, DTMs have not captured large topic dynamics.   This paper fills this research void, and presents a fast and parallelizable inference algorithm using Gibbs Sampling with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics that does not make any unwarranted assumptions. We also present a Metropolis-Hastings based $O(1)$ sampler for topic assignments for each word token. In a distributed environment, our algorithm requires very little communication between workers during sampling (almost embarrassingly parallel) and scales up to large-scale applications. We are able to learn the largest Dynamic Topic Model to our knowledge, and learned the dynamics of 1,000 topics from 2.6 million documents in less than half an hour, and our empirical results show that our algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than the baselines but also achieves lower perplexity."}
{"text": "  Multilayer networks have seen a resurgence under the umbrella of deep learning. Current deep learning algorithms train the layers of the network sequentially, improving algorithmic performance as well as providing some regularization. We present a new training algorithm for deep networks which trains \\emph{each node in the network} sequentially. Our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster, creates more interpretable internal representations at the node level, while not sacrificing on the ultimate out-of-sample performance."}
{"text": "  Many machine learning problems can be characterized by mutual contamination models. In these problems, one observes several random samples from different convex combinations of a set of unknown base distributions. It is of interest to decontaminate mutual contamination models, i.e., to recover the base distributions either exactly or up to a permutation. This paper considers the general setting where the base distributions are defined on arbitrary probability spaces. We examine the decontamination problem in two mutual contamination models that describe popular machine learning tasks: recovering the base distributions up to a permutation in a mixed membership model, and recovering the base distributions exactly in a partial label model for classification. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability of both mutual contamination models, algorithms for both problems in the infinite and finite sample cases, and introduce novel proof techniques based on affine geometry."}
{"text": "  We propose the segmented iHMM (siHMM), a hierarchical infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that supports a simple, efficient inference scheme. The siHMM is well suited to segmentation problems, where the goal is to identify points at which a time series transitions from one relatively stable regime to a new regime. Conventional iHMMs often struggle with such problems, since they have no mechanism for distinguishing between high- and low-level dynamics. Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs) can do better, but they require much more complex and expensive inference algorithms. The siHMM retains the simplicity and efficiency of the iHMM, but outperforms it on a variety of segmentation problems, achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of a more complicated HHMM."}
{"text": "  Modern data science relies on data analytic pipelines to organize interdependent computational steps. Such analytic pipelines often involve different algorithms across multiple steps, each with its own hyperparameters. To achieve the best performance, it is often critical to select optimal algorithms and to set appropriate hyperparameters, which requires large computational efforts. Bayesian optimization provides a principled way for searching optimal hyperparameters for a single algorithm. However, many challenges remain in solving pipeline optimization problems with high-dimensional and highly conditional search space. In this work, we propose Fast LineAr SearcH (FLASH), an efficient method for tuning analytic pipelines. FLASH is a two-layer Bayesian optimization framework, which firstly uses a parametric model to select promising algorithms, then computes a nonparametric model to fine-tune hyperparameters of the promising algorithms. FLASH also includes an effective caching algorithm which can further accelerate the search process. Extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets have demonstrated that FLASH significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both search speed and accuracy. Using 50% of the time budget, FLASH achieves up to 20% improvement on test error rate compared to the baselines. FLASH also yields state-of-the-art performance on a real-world application for healthcare predictive modeling."}
{"text": "  We explore the use of deep learning hierarchical models for problems in financial prediction and classification. Financial prediction problems -- such as those presented in designing and pricing securities, constructing portfolios, and risk management -- often involve large data sets with complex data interactions that currently are difficult or impossible to specify in a full economic model. Applying deep learning methods to these problems can produce more useful results than standard methods in finance. In particular, deep learning can detect and exploit interactions in the data that are, at least currently, invisible to any existing financial economic theory."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of accurately recovering a matrix B of size M by M , which represents a probability distribution over M2 outcomes, given access to an observed matrix of \"counts\" generated by taking independent samples from the distribution B. How can structural properties of the underlying matrix B be leveraged to yield computationally efficient and information theoretically optimal reconstruction algorithms? When can accurate reconstruction be accomplished in the sparse data regime? This basic problem lies at the core of a number of questions that are currently being considered by different communities, including building recommendation systems and collaborative filtering in the sparse data regime, community detection in sparse random graphs, learning structured models such as topic models or hidden Markov models, and the efforts from the natural language processing community to compute \"word embeddings\".   Our results apply to the setting where B has a low rank structure. For this setting, we propose an efficient algorithm that accurately recovers the underlying M by M matrix using Theta(M) samples. This result easily translates to Theta(M) sample algorithms for learning topic models and learning hidden Markov Models. These linear sample complexities are optimal, up to constant factors, in an extremely strong sense: even testing basic properties of the underlying matrix (such as whether it has rank 1 or 2) requires Omega(M) samples. We provide an even stronger lower bound where distinguishing whether a sequence of observations were drawn from the uniform distribution over M observations versus being generated by an HMM with two hidden states requires Omega(M) observations. This precludes sublinear-sample hypothesis tests for basic properties, such as identity or uniformity, as well as sublinear sample estimators for quantities such as the entropy rate of HMMs."}
{"text": "  Hashing methods aim to learn a set of hash functions which map the original features to compact binary codes with similarity preserving in the Hamming space. Hashing has proven a valuable tool for large-scale information retrieval. We propose a column generation based binary code learning framework for data-dependent hash function learning. Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise similarity comparison information, our column generation based method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relations within the large-margin learning framework. Our method iteratively learns the best hash functions during the column generation procedure. Existing hashing methods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or graph Laplacian related loss functions, instead of the performance evaluation criteria of interest---multivariate performance measures such as the AUC and NDCG. Our column generation based method can be further generalized from the triplet loss to a general structured learning based framework that allows one to directly optimize multivariate performance measures. For optimizing general ranking measures, the resulting optimization problem can involve exponentially or infinitely many variables and constraints, which is more challenging than standard structured output learning. We use a combination of column generation and cutting-plane techniques to solve the optimization problem. To speed-up the training we further explore stage-wise training and propose to use a simplified NDCG loss for efficient inference. We demonstrate the generality of our method by applying it to ranking prediction and image retrieval, and show that it outperforms a few state-of-the-art hashing methods."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new approach for amortizing inference in directed graphical models by learning heuristic approximations to stochastic inverses, designed specifically for use as proposal distributions in sequential Monte Carlo methods. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning a structured neural network which represents an inverse factorization of the graphical model, resulting in a conditional density estimator that takes as input particular values of the observed random variables, and returns an approximation to the distribution of the latent variables. This recognition model can be learned offline, independent from any particular dataset, prior to performing inference. The output of these networks can be used as automatically-learned high-quality proposal distributions to accelerate sequential Monte Carlo across a diverse range of problem settings."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven regression model for aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. First, we adopt a low rank representation (LRR) model to learn a powerful representation of the spectral response. Then, graph regularization is incorporated into the LRR model to capture the local structure information and the nonlinear property of the remote-sensing data. Since it is easy to acquire the rich satellite-retrieval results, we use them as a baseline to construct the graph. Finally, the learned feature representation is feeded into support vector machine (SVM) to retrieve AOD. Experiments are conducted on two widely used data sets acquired by different sensors, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared to the physical models and other state-of-the-art empirical models."}
{"text": "  We introduce a neural network architecture and a learning algorithm to produce factorized symbolic representations. We propose to learn these concepts by observing consecutive frames, letting all the components of the hidden representation except a small discrete set (gating units) be predicted from the previous frame, and let the factors of variation in the next frame be represented entirely by these discrete gated units (corresponding to symbolic representations). We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on datasets of faces undergoing 3D transformations and Atari 2600 games."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes an efficient algorithm (HOLRR) to handle regression tasks where the outputs have a tensor structure. We formulate the regression problem as the minimization of a least square criterion under a multilinear rank constraint, a difficult non convex problem. HOLRR computes efficiently an approximate solution of this problem, with solid theoretical guarantees. A kernel extension is also presented. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that HOLRR outperforms multivariate and multilinear regression methods and is considerably faster than existing tensor methods."}
{"text": "  In this study, we executed a genomic analysis with the objective of selecting a set of genes (possibly small) that would help in the detection and classification of samples from patients affected by Parkinson Disease. We performed a complete data analysis and during the exploratory phase, we selected a list of differentially expressed genes. Despite their association with the diseased state, we could not use them as a biomarker tool. Therefore, our research was extended to include a multivariate analysis approach resulting in the identification and selection of a group of 20 genes that showed a clear potential in detecting and correctly classify Parkinson Disease samples even in the presence of other neurodegenerative disorders."}

In the framework of the COSA method of Friedman and Meulman, subsequently improved in the form of the Sparse K-means method of Witten and Tibshirani, a natural and simpler hill-climbing approach is introduced. The new method is shown to be competitive with these two methods and others."}
{"text": "  Deep learning researchers commonly suggest that converged models are stuck in local minima. More recently, some researchers observed that under reasonable assumptions, the vast majority of critical points are saddle points, not true minima. Both descriptions suggest that weights converge around a point in weight space, be it a local optima or merely a critical point. However, it's possible that neither interpretation is accurate. As neural networks are typically over-complete, it's easy to show the existence of vast continuous regions through weight space with equal loss. In this paper, we build on recent work empirically characterizing the error surfaces of neural networks. We analyze training paths through weight space, presenting evidence that apparent convergence of loss does not correspond to weights arriving at critical points, but instead to large movements through flat regions of weight space. While it's trivial to show that neural network error surfaces are globally non-convex, we show that error surfaces are also locally non-convex, even after breaking symmetry with a random initialization and also after partial training."}
{"text": "  Gibbs sampling is a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique commonly used for estimating marginal distributions. To speed up Gibbs sampling, there has recently been interest in parallelizing it by executing asynchronously. While empirical results suggest that many models can be efficiently sampled asynchronously, traditional Markov chain analysis does not apply to the asynchronous case, and thus asynchronous Gibbs sampling is poorly understood. In this paper, we derive a better understanding of the two main challenges of asynchronous Gibbs: bias and mixing time. We show experimentally that our theoretical results match practical outcomes."}
{"text": "  During recent years, active learning has evolved into a popular paradigm for utilizing user's feedback to improve accuracy of learning algorithms. Active learning works by selecting the most informative sample among unlabeled data and querying the label of that point from user. Many different methods such as uncertainty sampling and minimum risk sampling have been utilized to select the most informative sample in active learning. Although many active learning algorithms have been proposed so far, most of them work with binary or multi-class classification problems and therefore can not be applied to problems in which only samples from one class as well as a set of unlabeled data are available.   Such problems arise in many real-world situations and are known as the problem of learning from positive and unlabeled data. In this paper we propose an active learning algorithm that can work when only samples of one class as well as a set of unlabelled data are available. Our method works by separately estimating probability desnity of positive and unlabeled points and then computing expected value of informativeness to get rid of a hyper-parameter and have a better measure of informativeness./ Experiments and empirical analysis show promising results compared to other similar methods."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we address the problem of data description using a Bayesian framework. The goal of data description is to draw a boundary around objects of a certain class of interest to discriminate that class from the rest of the feature space. Data description is also known as one-class learning and has a wide range of applications.   The proposed approach uses a Bayesian framework to precisely compute the class boundary and therefore can utilize domain information in form of prior knowledge in the framework. It can also operate in the kernel space and therefore recognize arbitrary boundary shapes. Moreover, the proposed method can utilize unlabeled data in order to improve accuracy of discrimination.   We evaluate our method using various real-world datasets and compare it with other state of the art approaches of data description. Experiments show promising results and improved performance over other data description and one-class learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in rigorous algorithms for the inference of cancer progression from genomic data. The motivations are manifold: (i) growing NGS and single cell data from cancer patients, (ii) need for novel Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms to infer models of cancer progression, and (iii) a desire to understand the temporal and heterogeneous structure of tumor to tame its progression by efficacious therapeutic intervention. This thesis presents a multi-disciplinary effort to model tumor progression involving successive accumulation of genetic alterations, each resulting populations manifesting themselves in a cancer phenotype. The framework presented in this work along with algorithms derived from it, represents a novel approach for inferring cancer progression, whose accuracy and convergence rates surpass the existing techniques. The approach derives its power from several fields including algorithms in machine learning, theory of causality and cancer biology. Furthermore, a modular pipeline to extract ensemble-level progression models from sequenced cancer genomes is proposed. The pipeline combines state-of-the-art techniques for sample stratification, driver selection, identification of fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations and progression model inference. Furthermore, the results are validated by synthetic data with realistic generative models, and empirically interpreted in the context of real cancer datasets; in the later case, biologically significant conclusions are also highlighted. Specifically, it demonstrates the pipeline's ability to reproduce much of the knowledge on colorectal cancer, as well as to suggest novel hypotheses. Lastly, it also proves that the proposed framework can be applied to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer clones in single patients, as illustrated by an example from clear cell renal carcinomas."}
{"text": "  Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are capable of learning to encode and exploit activation history over an arbitrary timescale. However, in practice, state of the art gradient descent based training methods are known to suffer from difficulties in learning long term dependencies. Here, we describe a novel training method that involves concurrent parallel cloned networks, each sharing the same weights, each trained at different stimulus phase and each maintaining independent activation histories. Training proceeds by recursively performing batch-updates over the parallel clones as activation history is progressively increased. This allows conflicts to propagate hierarchically from short-term contexts towards longer-term contexts until they are resolved. We illustrate the parallel clones method and hierarchical conflict propagation with a character-level deep RNN tasked with memorizing a paragraph of Moby Dick (by Herman Melville)."}

{"text": "  In this paper, we present a framework for fitting multivariate Hawkes processes for large-scale problems both in the number of events in the observed history $n$ and the number of event types $d$ (i.e. dimensions). The proposed Low-Rank Hawkes Process (LRHP) framework introduces a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix that allows to perform the nonparametric learning of the $d^2$ triggering kernels using at most $O(ndr^2)$ operations, where $r$ is the rank of the approximation ($r \\ll d,n$). This comes as a major improvement to the existing state-of-the-art inference algorithms that are in $O(nd^2)$. Furthermore, the low-rank approximation allows LRHP to learn representative patterns of interaction between event types, which may be valuable for the analysis of such complex processes in real world datasets. The efficiency and scalability of our approach is illustrated with numerical experiments on simulated as well as real datasets."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the optimal adaptive allocation of measurement effort for identifying the best among a finite set of options or designs. An experimenter sequentially chooses designs to measure and observes noisy signals of their quality with the goal of confidently identifying the best design after a small number of measurements. This paper proposes three simple and intuitive Bayesian algorithms for adaptively allocating measurement effort, and formalizes a sense in which these seemingly naive rules are the best possible. One proposal is top-two probability sampling, which computes the two designs with the highest posterior probability of being optimal, and then randomizes to select among these two. One is a variant of top-two sampling which considers not only the probability a design is optimal, but the expected amount by which its quality exceeds that of other designs. The final algorithm is a modified version of Thompson sampling that is tailored for identifying the best design. We prove that these simple algorithms satisfy a sharp optimality property. In a frequentist setting where the true quality of the designs is fixed, one hopes the posterior definitively identifies the optimal design, in the sense that that the posterior probability assigned to the event that some other design is optimal converges to zero as measurements are collected. We show that under the proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at an exponential rate, and the corresponding exponent is the best possible among all allocation"}
{"text": "  We consider Bayesian optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box objective function, where we also have access to cheaper approximations of the objective. In general, such approximations arise in applications such as reinforcement learning, engineering, and the natural sciences, and are subject to an inherent, unknown bias. This model discrepancy is caused by an inadequate internal model that deviates from reality and can vary over the domain, making the utilization of these approximations a non-trivial task.   We present a novel algorithm that provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of the uncertainties arising from model discrepancies and noisy observations. Its optimization decisions rely on a value of information analysis that extends the Knowledge Gradient factor to the setting of multiple information sources that vary in cost: each sampling decision maximizes the predicted benefit per unit cost.   We conduct an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that the method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques: it finds designs of considerably higher objective value and additionally inflicts less cost in the exploration process."}
{"text": "  In order to find Nash-equilibria for two-player zero-sum games where each player plays combinatorial objects like spanning trees, matchings etc, we consider two online learning algorithms: the online mirror descent (OMD) algorithm and the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm. The OMD algorithm requires the computation of a certain Bregman projection, that has closed form solutions for simple convex sets like the Euclidean ball or the simplex. However, for general polyhedra one often needs to exploit the general machinery of convex optimization. We give a novel primal-style algorithm for computing Bregman projections on the base polytopes of polymatroids. Next, in the case of the MWU algorithm, although it scales logarithmically in the number of pure strategies or experts $N$ in terms of regret, the algorithm takes time polynomial in $N$; this especially becomes a problem when learning combinatorial objects. We give a general recipe to simulate the multiplicative weights update algorithm in time polynomial in their natural dimension. This is useful whenever there exists a polynomial time generalized counting oracle (even if approximate) over these objects. Finally, using the combinatorial structure of symmetric Nash-equilibria (SNE) when both players play bases of matroids, we show that these can be found with a single projection or convex minimization (without using online learning)."}
{"text": "  Policy search can in principle acquire complex strategies for control of robots and other autonomous systems. When the policy is trained to process raw sensory inputs, such as images and depth maps, it can also acquire a strategy that combines perception and control. However, effectively processing such complex inputs requires an expressive policy class, such as a large neural network. These high-dimensional policies are difficult to train, especially when learning to control safety-critical systems. We propose PLATO, an algorithm that trains complex control policies with supervised learning, using model-predictive control (MPC) to generate the supervision, hence never in need of running a partially trained and potentially unsafe policy. PLATO uses an adaptive training method to modify the behavior of MPC to gradually match the learned policy in order to generate training samples at states that are likely to be visited by the learned policy. PLATO also maintains the MPC cost as an objective to avoid highly undesirable actions that would result from strictly following the learned policy before it has been fully trained. We prove that this type of adaptive MPC expert produces supervision that leads to good long-horizon performance of the resulting policy. We also empirically demonstrate that MPC can still avoid dangerous on-policy actions in unexpected situations during training. Our empirical results on a set of challenging simulated aerial vehicle tasks demonstrate that, compared to prior methods, PLATO learns faster, experiences substantially fewer catastrophic failures (crashes) during training, and often converges to a better policy."}
{"text": "  We apply a wild bootstrap method to the Lancaster three-variable interaction measure in order to detect factorisation of the joint distribution on three variables forming a stationary random process, for which the existing permutation bootstrap method fails. As in the i.i.d. case, the Lancaster test is found to outperform existing tests in cases for which two independent variables individually have a weak influence on a third, but that when considered jointly the influence is strong. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: first, we prove that the Lancaster statistic satisfies the conditions required to estimate the quantiles of the null distribution using the wild bootstrap; second, the manner in which this is proved is novel, simpler than existing methods, and can further be applied to other statistics."}
{"text": "  While the universal approximation property holds both for hierarchical and shallow networks, we prove that deep (hierarchical) networks can approximate the class of compositional functions with the same accuracy as shallow networks but with exponentially lower number of training parameters as well as VC-dimension. This theorem settles an old conjecture by Bengio on the role of depth in networks. We then define a general class of scalable, shift-invariant algorithms to show a simple and natural set of requirements that justify deep convolutional networks."}
{"text": "  Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian \"signals\" from high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded as a generalization of projection pursuit (PP) and independent component analysis (ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed, seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA approach called least-squares NGCA (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a solution analytically through least-squares estimation of log-density gradients and eigendecomposition. However, since pre-whitening of data is involved in LSNGCA, it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a whitening-free LSNGCA method and experimentally demonstrate its superiority."}
{"text": "  We introduce overdispersed black-box variational inference, a method to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator of the gradient in black-box variational inference. Instead of taking samples from the variational distribution, we use importance sampling to take samples from an overdispersed distribution in the same exponential family as the variational approximation. Our approach is general since it can be readily applied to any exponential family distribution, which is the typical choice for the variational approximation. We run experiments on two non-conjugate probabilistic models to show that our method effectively reduces the variance, and the overhead introduced by the computation of the proposal parameters and the importance weights is negligible. We find that our overdispersed importance sampling scheme provides lower variance than black-box variational inference, even when the latter uses twice the number of samples. This results in faster convergence of the black-box inference procedure."}
{"text": "  In this paper, a novel approach to classifier ensemble creation is presented. While other ensemble creation techniques are based on careful selection of existing classifiers or preprocessing of the data, the presented approach automatically creates an optimal labelling for a number of classifiers, which are then assigned to the original data instances and fed to classifiers. The approach has been evaluated on high-dimensional biomedical datasets. The results show that the approach outperformed individual approaches in all cases."}
{"text": "  We consider an online learning to rank setting in which, at each round, an oblivious adversary generates a list of $m$ documents, pertaining to a query, and the learner produces scores to rank the documents. The adversary then generates a relevance vector and the learner updates its ranker according to the feedback received. We consider the setting where the feedback is restricted to be the relevance levels of only the top $k$ documents in the ranked list for $k \\ll m$. However, the performance of learner is judged based on the unrevealed full relevance vectors, using an appropriate learning to rank loss function. We develop efficient algorithms for well known losses in the pointwise, pairwise and listwise families. We also prove that no online algorithm can have sublinear regret, with top-1 feedback, for any loss that is calibrated with respect to NDCG. We apply our algorithms on benchmark datasets demonstrating efficient online learning of a ranking function from highly restricted feedback."}
{"text": "  We consider the generalization ability of algorithms for learning to rank at a query level, a problem also called subset ranking. Existing generalization error bounds necessarily degrade as the size of the document list associated with a query increases. We show that such a degradation is not intrinsic to the problem. For several loss functions, including the cross-entropy loss used in the well known ListNet method, there is \\emph{no} degradation in generalization ability as document lists become longer. We also provide novel generalization error bounds under $\\ell_1$ regularization and faster convergence rates if the loss function is smooth."}
{"text": "  Partition functions of probability distributions are important quantities for model evaluation and comparisons. We present a new method to compute partition functions of complex and multimodal distributions. Such distributions are often sampled using simulated tempering, which augments the target space with an auxiliary inverse temperature variable. Our method exploits the multinomial probability law of the inverse temperatures, and provides estimates of the partition function in terms of a simple quotient of Rao-Blackwellized marginal inverse temperature probability estimates, which are updated while sampling. We show that the method has interesting connections with several alternative popular methods, and offers some significant advantages. In particular, we empirically find that the new method provides more accurate estimates than Annealed Importance Sampling when calculating partition functions of large Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM); moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to track training and validation log-likelihoods during learning of RBMs, at minimal computational cost."}
{"text": "  Kernel methods are one of the mainstays of machine learning, but the problem of kernel learning remains challenging, with only a few heuristics and very little theory. This is of particular importance in methods based on estimation of kernel mean embeddings of probability measures. For characteristic kernels, which include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely determines its probability measure, so it can be used to design a powerful statistical testing framework, which includes nonparametric two-sample and independence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaussian process prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely related to recently proposed shrinkage estimators for kernel mean embeddings, while the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various possible applications. Critically for the purposes of kernel learning, our model gives a simple, closed form marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data given the kernel hyperparameters. This marginal pseudolikelihood can either be optimized to inform the hyperparameter choice or fully Bayesian inference can be used."}
{"text": "  We consider the online sparse linear regression problem, which is the problem of sequentially making predictions observing only a limited number of features in each round, to minimize regret with respect to the best sparse linear regressor, where prediction accuracy is measured by square loss. We give an inefficient algorithm that obtains regret bounded by $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ after $T$ prediction rounds. We complement this result by showing that no algorithm running in polynomial time per iteration can achieve regret bounded by $O(T^{1-\\delta})$ for any constant $\\delta > 0$ unless $\\text{NP} \\subseteq \\text{BPP}$. This computational hardness result resolves an open problem presented in COLT 2014 (Kale, 2014) and also posed by Zolghadr et al. (2013). This hardness result holds even if the algorithm is allowed to access more features than the best sparse linear regressor up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension."}
{"text": "  This note compares two recently published machine learning methods for constructing flexible, but tractable families of variational hidden-variable posteriors. The first method, called \"hierarchical variational models\" enriches the inference model with an extra variable, while the other, called \"auxiliary deep generative models\", enriches the generative model instead. We conclude that the two methods are mathematically equivalent."}
{"text": "  We introduce a batched lazy algorithm for supervised classification using decision trees. It avoids unnecessary visits to irrelevant nodes when it is used to make predictions with either eagerly or lazily trained decision trees. A set of experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can outperform both the conventional and lazy decision tree algorithms in terms of computation time as well as memory consumption, without compromising accuracy."}
{"text": "  In this work, we adapt the rank aggregation framework for the discovery of optimal course sequences at the university level. Each student provides a partial ranking of the courses taken throughout his or her undergraduate career. We compute pairwise rank comparisons between courses based on the order students typically take them, aggregate the results over the entire student population, and then obtain a proxy for the rank offset between pairs of courses. We extract a global ranking of the courses via several state-of-the art algorithms for ranking with pairwise noisy information, including SerialRank, Rank Centrality, and the recent SyncRank based on the group synchronization problem. We test this application of rank aggregation on 15 years of student data from the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Furthermore, we experiment with the above approach on different subsets of the student population conditioned on final GPA, and highlight several differences in the obtained rankings that uncover hidden pre-requisites in the Mathematics curriculum."}
{"text": "  Generalised Degrees of Freedom (GDF), as defined by Ye (1998 JASA 93:120-131), represent the sensitivity of model fits to perturbations of the data. As such they can be computed for any statistical model, making it possible, in principle, to derive the number of parameters in machine-learning approaches. Defined originally for normally distributed data only, we here investigate the potential of this approach for Bernoulli-data. GDF-values for models of simulated and real data are compared to model complexity-estimates from cross-validation. Similarly, we computed GDF-based AICc for randomForest, neural networks and boosted regression trees and demonstrated its similarity to cross-validation. GDF-estimates for binary data were unstable and inconsistently sensitive to the number of data points perturbed simultaneously, while at the same time being extremely computer-intensive in their calculation. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation was more robust, based on fewer assumptions and faster to compute. Our findings suggest that the GDF-approach does not readily transfer to Bernoulli data and a wider range of regression approaches."}
{"text": "  Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks are capable of modelling highly non-linear functions by capturing different levels of abstraction of data hierarchically. While training deep networks, first the system is initialized near a good optimum by greedy layer-wise unsupervised pre-training. However, with burgeoning data and increasing dimensions of the architecture, the time complexity of this approach becomes enormous. Also, greedy pre-training of the layers often turns detrimental by over-training a layer causing it to lose harmony with the rest of the network. In this paper a synchronized parallel algorithm for pre-training deep networks on multi-core machines has been proposed. Different layers are trained by parallel threads running on different cores with regular synchronization. Thus the pre-training process becomes faster and chances of over-training are reduced. This is experimentally validated using a stacked autoencoder for dimensionality reduction of MNIST handwritten digit database. The proposed algorithm achieved 26\\% speed-up compared to greedy layer-wise pre-training for achieving the same reconstruction accuracy substantiating its potential as an alternative."}
{"text": "  For many machine learning problems, data is abundant and it may be prohibitive to make multiple passes through the full training set. In this context, we investigate strategies for dynamically increasing the effective sample size, when using iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Our interest is motivated by the rise of variance-reduced methods, which achieve linear convergence rates that scale favorably for smaller sample sizes. Exploiting this feature, we show -- theoretically and empirically -- how to obtain significant speed-ups with a novel algorithm that reaches statistical accuracy on an $n$-sample in $2n$, instead of $n \\log n$ steps."}
{"text": "  The present study introduces a method for improving the classification performance of imbalanced multiclass data streams from wireless body worn sensors. Data imbalance is an inherent problem in activity recognition caused by the irregular time distribution of activities, which are sequential and dependent on previous movements. We use conditional random fields (CRF), a graphical model for structured classification, to take advantage of dependencies between activities in a sequence. However, CRFs do not consider the negative effects of class imbalance during training. We propose a class-wise dynamically weighted CRF (dWCRF) where weights are automatically determined during training by maximizing the expected overall F-score. Our results based on three case studies from a healthcare application using a batteryless body worn sensor, demonstrate that our method, in general, improves overall and minority class F-score when compared to other CRF based classifiers and achieves similar or better overall and class-wise performance when compared to SVM based classifiers under conditions of limited training data. We also confirm the performance of our approach using an additional battery powered body worn sensor dataset, achieving similar results in cases of high class imbalance."}
{"text": "  We develop Square Root Graphical Models (SQR), a novel class of parametric graphical models that provides multivariate generalizations of univariate exponential family distributions. Previous multivariate graphical models [Yang et al. 2015] did not allow positive dependencies for the exponential and Poisson generalizations. However, in many real-world datasets, variables clearly have positive dependencies. For example, the airport delay time in New York---modeled as an exponential distribution---is positively related to the delay time in Boston. With this motivation, we give an example of our model class derived from the univariate exponential distribution that allows for almost arbitrary positive and negative dependencies with only a mild condition on the parameter matrix---a condition akin to the positive definiteness of the Gaussian covariance matrix. Our Poisson generalization allows for both positive and negative dependencies without any constraints on the parameter values. We also develop parameter estimation methods using node-wise regressions with $\\ell_1$ regularization and likelihood approximation methods using sampling. Finally, we demonstrate our exponential generalization on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset of airport delay times."}
{"text": "  Finding interesting symmetrical topological structures in high-dimensional systems is an important problem in statistical machine learning. Limited amount of available high-dimensional data and its sensitivity to noise pose computational challenges to find symmetry. Our paper presents a new method to find local symmetries in a low-dimensional 2-D grid structure which is embedded in high-dimensional structure. To compute the symmetry in a grid structure, we introduce three legal grid moves (i) Commutation (ii) Cyclic Permutation (iii) Stabilization on sets of local grid squares, grid blocks. The three grid moves are legal transformations as they preserve the statistical distribution of hamming distances in each grid block. We propose and coin the term of grid symmetry of data on the 2-D data grid as the invariance of statistical distributions of hamming distance are preserved after a sequence of grid moves. We have computed and analyzed the grid symmetry of data on multivariate Gaussian distributions and Gamma distributions with noise."}
{"text": "  One of the most challenging problems in computational advertising is the prediction of click-through and conversion rates for bidding in online advertising auctions. An unaddressed problem in previous approaches is the existence of highly non-uniform misprediction costs. While for model evaluation these costs have been taken into account through recently proposed business-aware offline metrics -- such as the Utility metric which measures the impact on advertiser profit -- this is not the case when training the models themselves. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we formally analyze the relationship between optimizing the Utility metric and the log loss, which is considered as one of the state-of-the-art approaches in conversion modeling. Our analysis motivates the idea of weighting the log loss with the business value of the predicted outcome. We present and analyze a new cost weighting scheme and show that significant gains in offline and online performance can be achieved."}
{"text": "  The model of learning with \\emph{local membership queries} interpolates between the PAC model and the membership queries model by allowing the learner to query the label of any example that is similar to an example in the training set. This model, recently proposed and studied by Awasthi, Feldman and Kanade, aims to facilitate practical use of membership queries.   We continue this line of work, proving both positive and negative results in the {\\em distribution free} setting. We restrict to the boolean cube $\\{-1, 1\\}^n$, and say that a query is $q$-local if it is of a hamming distance $\\le q$ from some training example. On the positive side, we show that $1$-local queries already give an additional strength, and allow to learn a certain type of DNF formulas. On the negative side, we show that even $\\left(n^{0.99}\\right)$-local queries cannot help to learn various classes including Automata, DNFs and more. Likewise, $q$-local queries for any constant $q$ cannot help to learn Juntas, Decision Trees, Sparse Polynomials and more. Moreover, for these classes, an algorithm that uses $\\left(\\log^{0.99}(n)\\right)$-local queries would lead to a breakthrough in the best known running times."}
{"text": "  This paper investigates the phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a signal from the magnitudes of its linear measurements. We develop statistically and computationally efficient algorithms for the situation when the measurements are corrupted by sparse outliers that can take arbitrary values. We propose a novel approach to robustify the gradient descent algorithm by using the sample median as a guide for pruning spurious samples in initialization and local search. Adopting the Poisson loss and the reshaped quadratic loss respectively, we obtain two algorithms termed median-TWF and median-RWF, both of which provably recover the signal from a near-optimal number of measurements when the measurement vectors are composed of i.i.d. Gaussian entries, up to a logarithmic factor, even when a constant fraction of the measurements are adversarially corrupted. We further show that both algorithms are stable in the presence of additional dense bounded noise. Our analysis is accomplished by developing non-trivial concentration results of median-related quantities, which may be of independent interest. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "  Manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but can be computationally expensive procedures when applied to large data sets or when similarities are expensive to compute. To date, little work has been done to investigate the tradeoff between computational resources and the quality of learned representations. We present both theoretical and experimental explorations of this question. In particular, we consider Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings based on a kernel matrix, and explore how the embeddings behave when this kernel matrix is corrupted by occlusion and noise. Our main theoretical result shows that under modest noise and occlusion assumptions, we can (with high probability) recover a good approximation to the Laplacian eigenmaps embedding based on the uncorrupted kernel matrix. Our results also show how regularization can aid this approximation. Experimentally, we explore the effects of noise and occlusion on Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings of two real-world data sets, one from speech processing and one from neuroscience, as well as a synthetic data set."}
{"text": "  We construct universal prediction systems in the spirit of Popper's falsifiability and Kolmogorov complexity and randomness. These prediction systems do not depend on any statistical assumptions (but under the IID assumption they dominate, to within the usual accuracy, conformal prediction). Our constructions give rise to a theory of algorithmic complexity and randomness of time containing analogues of several notions and results of the classical theory of Kolmogorov complexity and randomness."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of maximizing an unknown function over a compact and convex set using as few observations as possible. We observe that the optimization of the function essentially relies on learning the induced bipartite ranking rule of f. Based on this idea, we relate global optimization to bipartite ranking which allows to address problems with high dimensional input space, as well as cases of functions with weak regularity properties. The paper introduces novel meta-algorithms for global optimization which rely on the choice of any bipartite ranking method. Theoretical properties are provided as well as convergence guarantees and equivalences between various optimization methods are obtained as a by-product. Eventually, numerical evidence is given to show that the main algorithm of the paper which adapts empirically to the underlying ranking structure essentially outperforms existing state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms in typical benchmarks."}
{"text": "  We study optimal conformity measures for various criteria of efficiency of classification in an idealised setting. This leads to an important class of criteria of efficiency that we call probabilistic; it turns out that the most standard criteria of efficiency used in literature on conformal prediction are not probabilistic unless the problem of classification is binary. We consider both unconditional and label-conditional conformal prediction."}

A variant of conformal predictors called Inductive Mondrian Conformal Predictor is applied to deal with these challenges. Results are presented for several non-conformity measures (NCM) extracted from underlying algorithms and different kernels.

{"text": "  In traditional multiple instance learning (MIL), both positive and negative bags are required to learn a prediction function. However, a high human cost is needed to know the label of each bag---positive or negative. Only positive bags contain our focus (positive instances) while negative bags consist of noise or background (negative instances). So we do not expect to spend too much to label the negative bags. Contrary to our expectation, nearly all existing MIL methods require enough negative bags besides positive ones. In this paper we propose an algorithm called \"Positive Multiple Instance\" (PMI), which learns a classifier given only a set of positive bags. So the annotation of negative bags becomes unnecessary in our method. PMI is constructed based on the assumption that the unknown positive instances in positive bags be similar each other and constitute one compact cluster in feature space and the negative instances locate outside this cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that PMI achieves the performances close to or a little worse than those of the traditional MIL algorithms on benchmark and real data sets. However, the number of training bags in PMI is reduced significantly compared with traditional MIL algorithms."}
{"text": "  Linear autoregressive models serve as basic representations of discrete time stochastic processes. Different attempts have been made to provide non-linear versions of the basic autoregressive process, including different versions based on kernel methods. Motivated by the powerful framework of Hilbert space embeddings of distributions, in this paper we apply this methodology for the kernel embedding of an autoregressive process of order $p$. By doing so, we provide a non-linear version of an autoregressive process, that shows increased performance over the linear model in highly complex time series. We use the method proposed for one-step ahead forecasting of different time-series, and compare its performance against other non-linear methods."}
{"text": "  Kernel classifiers and regressors designed for structured data, such as sequences, trees and graphs, have significantly advanced a number of interdisciplinary areas such as computational biology and drug design. Typically, kernels are designed beforehand for a data type which either exploit statistics of the structures or make use of probabilistic generative models, and then a discriminative classifier is learned based on the kernels via convex optimization. However, such an elegant two-stage approach also limited kernel methods from scaling up to millions of data points, and exploiting discriminative information to learn feature representations.   We propose, structure2vec, an effective and scalable approach for structured data representation based on the idea of embedding latent variable models into feature spaces, and learning such feature spaces using discriminative information. Interestingly, structure2vec extracts features by performing a sequence of function mappings in a way similar to graphical model inference procedures, such as mean field and belief propagation. In applications involving millions of data points, we showed that structure2vec runs 2 times faster, produces models which are $10,000$ times smaller, while at the same time achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance."}
{"text": "  The Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm has achieved notable success in training energy-based models including Restricted Boltzmann Machines and played a key role in the emergence of deep learning. The idea of this algorithm is to approximate the intractable term in the exact gradient of the log-likelihood function by using short Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs. The approximate gradient is computationally-cheap but biased. Whether and why the CD algorithm provides an asymptotically consistent estimate are still open questions. This paper studies the asymptotic properties of the CD algorithm in canonical exponential families, which are special cases of the energy-based model. Suppose the CD algorithm runs $m$ MCMC transition steps at each iteration $t$ and iteratively generates a sequence of parameter estimates $\\{\\theta_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ given an i.i.d. data sample $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\sim p_{\\theta_\\star}$. Under conditions which are commonly obeyed by the CD algorithm in practice, we prove the existence of some bounded $m$ such that any limit point of the time average $\\left. \\sum_{s=0}^{t-1} \\theta_s \\right/ t$ as $t \\to \\infty$ is a consistent estimate for the true parameter $\\theta_\\star$. Our proof is based on the fact that $\\{\\theta_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a homogenous Markov chain conditional on the data sample $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n$. This chain meets the Foster-Lyapunov drift criterion and converges to a random walk around the Maximum Likelihood Estimate. The range of the random walk shrinks to zero at rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt[3]{n})$ as the sample size $n \\to \\infty$."}
{"text": "  The coding matrix design plays a fundamental role in the prediction performance of the error correcting output codes (ECOC)-based multi-class task. {In many-class classification problems, e.g., fine-grained categorization, it is difficult to distinguish subtle between-class differences under existing coding schemes due to a limited choices of coding values.} In this paper, we investigate whether one can relax existing binary and ternary code design to $N$-ary code design to achieve better classification performance. {In particular, we present a novel $N$-ary coding scheme that decomposes the original multi-class problem into simpler multi-class subproblems, which is similar to applying a divide-and-conquer method.} The two main advantages of such a coding scheme are as follows: (i) the ability to construct more discriminative codes and (ii) the flexibility for the user to select the best $N$ for ECOC-based classification. We show empirically that the optimal $N$ (based on classification performance) lies in $[3, 10]$ with some trade-off in computational cost. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights on the dependency of the generalization error bound of an $N$-ary ECOC on the average base classifier generalization error and the minimum distance between any two codes constructed. Extensive experimental results on benchmark multi-class datasets show that the proposed coding scheme achieves superior prediction performance over the state-of-the-art coding methods."}
{"text": "  The Nystr\\\"om method has long been popular for scaling up kernel methods. Its theoretical guarantees and empirical performance rely critically on the quality of the landmarks selected. We study landmark selection for Nystr\\\"om using Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), discrete probability models that allow tractable generation of diverse samples. We prove that landmarks selected via DPPs guarantee bounds on approximation errors; subsequently, we analyze implications for kernel ridge regression. Contrary to prior reservations due to cubic complexity of DPPsampling, we show that (under certain conditions) Markov chain DPP sampling requires only linear time in the size of the data. We present several empirical results that support our theoretical analysis, and demonstrate the superior performance of DPP-based landmark selection compared with existing approaches."}
{"text": "  Many real world graphs, such as the graphs of molecules, exhibit structure at multiple different scales, but most existing kernels between graphs are either purely local or purely global in character. In contrast, by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel), which has the property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two graphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels to subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible, we also introduce a randomized projection procedure, similar to the Nystr\\\"om method, but for RKHS operators."}
{"text": "  Many practical learning systems aggregate data across many users, while learning theory traditionally considers a single learner who trusts all of their observations. A case in point is the foundational learning problem of prediction with expert advice. To date, there has been no theoretical study of the general collaborative version of prediction with expert advice, in which many users face a similar problem and would like to share their experiences in order to learn faster. A key issue in this collaborative framework is robustness: generally algorithms that aggregate data are vulnerable to manipulation by even a small number of dishonest users.   We exhibit the first robust collaborative algorithm for prediction with expert advice. When all users are honest and have similar tastes our algorithm matches the performance of pooling data and using a traditional algorithm. But our algorithm also guarantees that adding users never significantly degrades performance, even if the additional users behave adversarially. We achieve strong guarantees even when the overwhelming majority of users behave adversarially. As a special case, our algorithm is extremely robust to variation amongst the users."}
{"text": "  We propose a general modeling and inference framework that composes probabilistic graphical models with deep learning methods and combines their respective strengths. Our model family augments graphical structure in latent variables with neural network observation models. For inference, we extend variational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributions with recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components of these models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving a scalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, natural gradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick. We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application to mouse behavioral phenotyping."}
{"text": "  If a document is about travel, we may expect that short snippets of the document should also be about travel. We introduce a general framework for incorporating these types of invariances into a discriminative classifier. The framework imagines data as being drawn from a slice of a Levy process. If we slice the Levy process at an earlier point in time, we obtain additional pseudo-examples, which can be used to train the classifier. We show that this scheme has two desirable properties: it preserves the Bayes decision boundary, and it is equivalent to fitting a generative model in the limit where we rewind time back to 0. Our construction captures popular schemes such as Gaussian feature noising and dropout training, as well as admitting new generalizations."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of prediction with expert advice when the losses of the experts have low-dimensional structure: they are restricted to an unknown $d$-dimensional subspace. We devise algorithms with regret bounds that are independent of the number of experts and depend only on the rank $d$. For the stochastic model we show a tight bound of $\\Theta(\\sqrt{dT})$, and extend it to a setting of an approximate $d$ subspace. For the adversarial model we show an upper bound of $O(d\\sqrt{T})$ and a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{dT})$."}
{"text": "  We propose Information Theoretic-Learning (ITL) divergence measures for variational regularization of neural networks. We also explore ITL-regularized autoencoders as an alternative to variational autoencoding bayes, adversarial autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for randomly generating sample data without explicitly defining a partition function. This paper also formalizes, generative moment matching networks under the ITL framework."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label learning framework, called Multi-Label Self-Paced Learning (MLSPL), in an attempt to incorporate the self-paced learning strategy into multi-label learning regime. In light of the benefits of adopting the easy-to-hard strategy proposed by self-paced learning, the devised MLSPL aims to learn multiple labels jointly by gradually including label learning tasks and instances into model training from the easy to the hard. We first introduce a self-paced function as a regularizer in the multi-label learning formulation, so as to simultaneously rank priorities of the label learning tasks and the instances in each learning iteration. Considering that different multi-label learning scenarios often need different self-paced schemes during optimization, we thus propose a general way to find the desired self-paced functions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets suggest the state-of-the-art performance of our approach."}
{"text": "  We propose a new class of metrics on sets, vectors, and functions that can be used in various stages of data mining, including exploratory data analysis, learning, and result interpretation. These new distance functions unify and generalize some of the popular metrics, such as the Jaccard and bag distances on sets, Manhattan distance on vector spaces, and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance on integrable functions. We prove that the new metrics are complete and show useful relationships with $f$-divergences for probability distributions. To further extend our approach to structured objects such as concept hierarchies and ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution. We conduct empirical investigation to demonstrate intuitive interpretation of the new metrics and their effectiveness on real-valued, high-dimensional, and structured data. Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the new metrics outperformed multiple similarity and dissimilarity functions traditionally used in data mining, including the Minkowski family, the fractional $L^p$ family, two $f$-divergences, cosine distance, and two correlation coefficients. Finally, we argue that the new class of metrics is particularly appropriate for rapid processing of high-dimensional and structured data in distance-based learning."}
{"text": "  In this paper we address the identifiability and efficient learning problems of finite mixtures of Plackett-Luce models for rank data. We prove that for any $k\\geq 2$, the mixture of $k$ Plackett-Luce models for no more than $2k-1$ alternatives is non-identifiable and this bound is tight for $k=2$. For generic identifiability, we prove that the mixture of $k$ Plackett-Luce models over $m$ alternatives is generically identifiable if $k\\leq\\lfloor\\frac {m-2} 2\\rfloor!$. We also propose an efficient generalized method of moments (GMM) algorithm to learn the mixture of two Plackett-Luce models and show that the algorithm is consistent. Our experiments show that our GMM algorithm is significantly faster than the EMM algorithm by Gormley and Murphy (2008), while achieving competitive statistical efficiency."}
{"text": "  Patent lawsuits are costly and time-consuming. An ability to forecast a patent litigation and time to litigation allows companies to better allocate budget and time in managing their patent portfolios. We develop predictive models for estimating the likelihood of litigation for patents and the expected time to litigation based on both textual and non-textual features. Our work focuses on improving the state-of-the-art by relying on a different set of features and employing more sophisticated algorithms with more realistic data. The rate of patent litigations is very low, which consequently makes the problem difficult. The initial model for predicting the likelihood is further modified to capture a time-to-litigation perspective."}
{"text": "  We cast the problem of source localization on graphs as the simultaneous problem of sparse recovery and diffusion kernel learning. An l1 regularization term enforces the sparsity constraint while we recover the sources of diffusion from a single snapshot of the diffusion process. The diffusion kernel is estimated by assuming the process to be as generic as the standard heat diffusion. We show with synthetic data that we can concomitantly learn the diffusion kernel and the sources, given an estimated initialization. We validate our model with cholera mortality and atmospheric tracer diffusion data, showing also that the accuracy of the solution depends on the construction of the graph from the data points."}
{"text": "  How does one objectively measure the performance of an individual offensive lineman in the NFL? The existing literature proposes various measures that rely on subjective assessments of game film, but has yet to develop an objective methodology to evaluate performance. Using a variety of statistics related to an offensive lineman's performance, we develop a framework to objectively analyze the overall performance of an individual offensive lineman and determine specific linemen who are overvalued or undervalued relative to their salary. We identify eight players across the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 NFL seasons that are considered to be overvalued or undervalued and corroborate the results with existing metrics that are based on subjective evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, the techniques set forth in this work have not been utilized in previous works to evaluate the performance of NFL players at any position, including offensive linemen."}
{"text": "  Investigations have been performed into using clustering methods in data mining time-series data from smart meters. The problem is to identify patterns and trends in energy usage profiles of commercial and industrial customers over 24-hour periods, and group similar profiles. We tested our method on energy usage data provided by several U.S. power utilities. The results show accurate grouping of accounts similar in their energy usage patterns, and potential for the method to be utilized in energy efficiency programs."}
{"text": "  Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are among the most played digital games in the world. In these games, teams of players fight against each other in arena environments, and the gameplay is focused on tactical combat. Mastering MOBAs requires extensive practice, as is exemplified in the popular MOBA Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2). In this paper, we present three data-driven measures of spatio-temporal behavior in DotA 2: 1) Zone changes; 2) Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via a fuzzy approach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. We investigate how behavior varies across these measures as a function of the skill level of teams, using four tiers from novice to professional players. Results indicate that spatio-temporal behavior of MOBA teams is related to team skill, with professional teams having smaller within-team distances and conducting more zone changes than amateur teams. The temporal distribution of the within-team distances of professional and high-skilled teams also generally follows patterns distinct from lower skill ranks."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of change-point detection in multivariate time-series. The multivariate distribution of the observations is supposed to follow a graphical model, whose graph and parameters are affected by abrupt changes throughout time. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform exact Bayesian inference whenever one considers a simple class of undirected graphs called spanning trees as possible structures. We are then able to integrate on the graph and segmentation spaces at the same time by combining classical dynamic programming with algebraic results pertaining to spanning trees. In particular, we show that quantities such as posterior distributions for change-points or posterior edge probabilities over time can efficiently be obtained. We illustrate our results on both synthetic and experimental data arising from biology and neuroscience."}
{"text": "  This paper studies the trade-off between two different kinds of pure exploration: breadth versus depth. The most biased coin problem asks how many total coin flips are required to identify a \"heavy\" coin from an infinite bag containing both \"heavy\" coins with mean $\\theta_1 \\in (0,1)$, and \"light\" coins with mean $\\theta_0 \\in (0,\\theta_1)$, where heavy coins are drawn from the bag with probability $\\alpha \\in (0,1/2)$. The key difficulty of this problem lies in distinguishing whether the two kinds of coins have very similar means, or whether heavy coins are just extremely rare. This problem has applications in crowdsourcing, anomaly detection, and radio spectrum search. Chandrasekaran et. al. (2014) recently introduced a solution to this problem but it required perfect knowledge of $\\theta_0,\\theta_1,\\alpha$. In contrast, we derive algorithms that are adaptive to partial or absent knowledge of the problem parameters. Moreover, our techniques generalize beyond coins to more general instances of infinitely many armed bandit problems. We also prove lower bounds that show our algorithm's upper bounds are tight up to $\\log$ factors, and on the way characterize the sample complexity of differentiating between a single parametric distribution and a mixture of two such distributions. As a result, these bounds have surprising implications both for solutions to the most biased coin problem and for anomaly detection when only partial information about the parameters is known."}
{"text": "  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important unsupervised methods to handle high-dimensional data. However, due to the high computational complexity of its eigen decomposition solution, it hard to apply PCA to the large-scale data with high dimensionality. Meanwhile, the squared L2-norm based objective makes it sensitive to data outliers. In recent research, the L1-norm maximization based PCA method was proposed for efficient computation and being robust to outliers. However, this work used a greedy strategy to solve the eigen vectors. Moreover, the L1-norm maximization based objective may not be the correct robust PCA formulation, because it loses the theoretical connection to the minimization of data reconstruction error, which is one of the most important intuitions and goals of PCA. In this paper, we propose to maximize the L21-norm based robust PCA objective, which is theoretically connected to the minimization of reconstruction error. More importantly, we propose the efficient non-greedy optimization algorithms to solve our objective and the more general L21-norm maximization problem with theoretically guaranteed convergence. Experimental results on real world data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method for principal component analysis."}
{"text": "  It has been recognized that the diversity of base learners is of utmost importance to a good ensemble. This paper defines a novel measurement of diversity, termed as exclusivity. With the designed exclusivity, we further propose an ensemble model, namely Exclusivity Regularized Machine (ERM), to jointly suppress the training error of ensemble and enhance the diversity between bases. Moreover, an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based algorithm is customized to effectively and efficiently seek the optimal solution of ERM. Theoretical analysis on convergence and global optimality of the proposed algorithm, as well as experiments are provided to reveal the efficacy of our method and show its superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy and efficiency."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present a unified analysis of matrix completion under general low-dimensional structural constraints induced by {\\em any} norm regularization. We consider two estimators for the general problem of structured matrix completion, and provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and the estimation error. Our analysis relies on results from generic chaining, and we establish two intermediate results of independent interest: (a) in characterizing the size or complexity of low dimensional subsets in high dimensional ambient space, a certain partial complexity measure encountered in the analysis of matrix completion problems is characterized in terms of a well understood complexity measure of Gaussian widths, and (b) it is shown that a form of restricted strong convexity holds for matrix completion problems under general norm regularization. Further, we provide several non-trivial examples of structures included in our framework, notably the recently proposed spectral $k$-support norm."}
{"text": "  In this paper we present a theoretical analysis to understand sparse filtering, a recent and effective algorithm for unsupervised learning. The aim of this research is not to show whether or how well sparse filtering works, but to understand why and when sparse filtering does work. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of sparse filtering and its properties, and further offer an experimental validation of the main outcomes of our theoretical analysis. We show that sparse filtering works by explicitly maximizing the entropy of the learned representation through the maximization of the proxy of sparsity, and by implicitly preserving mutual information between original and learned representations through the constraint of preserving a structure of the data, specifically the structure defined by relations of neighborhoodness under the cosine distance. Furthermore, we empirically validate our theoretical results with artificial and real data sets, and we apply our theoretical understanding to explain the success of sparse filtering on real-world problems. Our work provides a strong theoretical basis for understanding sparse filtering: it highlights assumptions and conditions for success behind this feature distribution learning algorithm, and provides insights for developing new feature distribution learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  We present a semi-supervised learning framework based on graph embeddings. Given a graph between instances, we train an embedding for each instance to jointly predict the class label and the neighborhood context in the graph. We develop both transductive and inductive variants of our method. In the transductive variant of our method, the class labels are determined by both the learned embeddings and input feature vectors, while in the inductive variant, the embeddings are defined as a parametric function of the feature vectors, so predictions can be made on instances not seen during training. On a large and diverse set of benchmark tasks, including text classification, distantly supervised entity extraction, and entity classification, we show improved performance over many of the existing models."}
{"text": "  We propose a reparameterization of LSTM that brings the benefits of batch normalization to recurrent neural networks. Whereas previous works only apply batch normalization to the input-to-hidden transformation of RNNs, we demonstrate that it is both possible and beneficial to batch-normalize the hidden-to-hidden transition, thereby reducing internal covariate shift between time steps. We evaluate our proposal on various sequential problems such as sequence classification, language modeling and question answering. Our empirical results show that our batch-normalized LSTM consistently leads to faster convergence and improved generalization."}
{"text": "  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is an indispensable tool when there are few labeled entities and many unlabeled entities for which we want to predict labels. With graph-based methods, entities correspond to nodes in a graph and edges represent strong relations. At the heart of SSL algorithms is the specification of a dense {\\em kernel} of pairwise affinity values from the graph structure. A learning algorithm is then trained on the kernel together with labeled entities. The most popular kernels are {\\em spectral} and include the highly scalable \"symmetric\" Laplacian methods, that compute a soft labels using Jacobi iterations, and \"asymmetric\" methods including Personalized Page Rank (PPR) which use short random walks and apply with directed relations, such as like, follow, or hyperlinks.   We introduce {\\em Reach diffusion} and {\\em Distance diffusion} kernels that build on powerful social and economic models of centrality and influence in networks and capture the directed pairwise relations that underline social influence. Inspired by the success of social influence as an alternative to spectral centrality such as Page Rank, we explore SSL with our kernels and develop highly scalable algorithms for parameter setting, label learning, and sampling. We perform preliminary experiments that demonstrate the properties and potential of our kernels."}
{"text": "  We describe and study a model for an Automated Online Recommendation System (AORS) in which a user's preferences can be time-dependent and can also depend on the history of past recommendations and play-outs. The three key features of the model that makes it more realistic compared to existing models for recommendation systems are (1) user preference is inherently latent, (2) current recommendations can affect future preferences, and (3) it allows for the development of learning algorithms with provable performance guarantees. The problem is cast as an average-cost restless multi-armed bandit for a given user, with an independent partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for each item of content. We analyze the POMDP for a single arm, describe its structural properties, and characterize its optimal policy. We then develop a Thompson sampling-based online reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the parameters of the model and optimize utility from the binary responses of the users to continuous recommendations. We then analyze the performance of the learning algorithm and characterize the regret. Illustrative numerical results and directions for extension to the restless hidden Markov multi-armed bandit problem are also presented."}
{"text": "  Quantitatively assessing relationships between latent variables and observed variables is important for understanding and developing generative models and representation learning. In this paper, we propose latent-observed dissimilarity (LOD) to evaluate the dissimilarity between the probabilistic characteristics of latent and observed variables. We also define four essential types of generative models with different independence/conditional independence configurations. Experiments using tractable real-world data show that LOD can effectively capture the differences between models and reflect the capability for higher layer learning. They also show that the conditional independence of latent variables given observed variables contributes to improving the transmission of information and characteristics from lower layers to higher layers."}
{"text": "  Extremes play a special role in Anomaly Detection. Beyond inference and simulation purposes, probabilistic tools borrowed from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), such as the angular measure, can also be used to design novel statistical learning methods for Anomaly Detection/ranking. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on multivariate EVT to learn how to rank observations in a high dimensional space with respect to their degree of 'abnormality'. The procedure relies on an original dimension-reduction technique in the extreme domain that possibly produces a sparse representation of multivariate extremes and allows to gain insight into the dependence structure thereof, escaping the curse of dimensionality. The representation output by the unsupervised methodology we propose here can be combined with any Anomaly Detection technique tailored to non-extreme data. As it performs linearly with the dimension and almost linearly in the data (in O(dn log n)), it fits to large scale problems. The approach in this paper is novel in that EVT has never been used in its multivariate version in the field of Anomaly Detection. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach."}
{"text": "  Uplift modeling is a machine learning technique that aims to model treatment effects heterogeneity. It has been used in business and health sectors to predict the effect of a specific action on a given individual. Despite its advantages, uplift models show high sensitivity to noise and disturbance, which leads to unreliable results. In this paper we show different approaches to address the problem of uplift modeling, we demonstrate how disturbance in data can affect uplift measurement. We propose a new approach, we call it Pessimistic Uplift Modeling, that minimizes disturbance effects. We compared our approach with the existing uplift methods, on simulated and real data-sets. The experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing approaches, especially in the case of high noise data environment."}
{"text": "  Multi-label classification is a common supervised machine learning problem where each instance is associated with multiple classes. The key challenge in this problem is learning the correlations between the classes. An additional challenge arises when the labels of the training instances are provided by noisy, heterogeneous crowdworkers with unknown qualities. We first assume labels from a perfect source and propose a novel topic model where the present as well as the absent classes generate the latent topics and hence the words. We non-trivially extend our topic model to the scenario where the labels are provided by noisy crowdworkers. Extensive experimentation on real world datasets reveals the superior performance of the proposed model. The proposed model learns the qualities of the annotators as well, even with minimal training data."}
{"text": "  Many retailers today employ inventory management systems based on Re-Order Point Policies, most of which rely on the assumption that all decreases in product inventory levels result from product sales. Unfortunately, it usually happens that small but random quantities of the product get lost, stolen or broken without record as time passes, e.g., as a consequence of shoplifting. This is usual for retailers handling large varieties of inexpensive products, e.g., grocery stores. In turn, over time these discrepancies lead to stock freezing problems, i.e., situations where the system believes the stock is above the re-order point but the actual stock is at zero, and so no replenishments or sales occur. Motivated by these issues, we model the interaction between sales, losses, replenishments and inventory levels as a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where the inventory levels are unobserved (i.e., hidden) variables we wish to estimate. We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the sale and loss distributions, which relies on solving a one-dimensional dynamic program for the E-step and on solving two separate one-dimensional nonlinear programs for the M-step."}
{"text": "  In multi-label classification, an instance may be associated with a set of labels simultaneously. Recently, the research on multi-label classification has largely shifted its focus to the other end of the spectrum where the number of labels is assumed to be extremely large. The existing works focus on how to design scalable algorithms that offer fast training procedures and have a small memory footprint. However they ignore and even compound another challenge - the label imbalance problem. To address this drawback, we propose a novel Representation-based Multi-label Learning with Sampling (RMLS) approach. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the imbalance problem in multi-label classification with many labels. Our experimentations with real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Nonparametric detection of existence of an anomalous structure over a network is investigated. Nodes corresponding to the anomalous structure (if one exists) receive samples generated by a distribution q, which is different from a distribution p generating samples for other nodes. If an anomalous structure does not exist, all nodes receive samples generated by p. It is assumed that the distributions p and q are arbitrary and unknown. The goal is to design statistically consistent tests with probability of errors converging to zero as the network size becomes asymptotically large. Kernel-based tests are proposed based on maximum mean discrepancy that measures the distance between mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Detection of an anomalous interval over a line network is first studied. Sufficient conditions on minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals are characterized in order to guarantee the proposed test to be consistent. It is also shown that certain necessary conditions must hold to guarantee any test to be universally consistent. Comparison of sufficient and necessary conditions yields that the proposed test is order-level optimal and nearly optimal respectively in terms of minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals. Generalization of the results to other networks is further developed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed tests."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework, called Self-Paced Multi-Task Learning (SPMTL). Different from previous works treating all tasks and instances equally when training, SPMTL attempts to jointly learn the tasks by taking into consideration the complexities of both tasks and instances. This is inspired by the cognitive process of human brain that often learns from the easy to the hard. We construct a compact SPMTL formulation by proposing a new task-oriented regularizer that can jointly prioritize the tasks and the instances. Thus it can be interpreted as a self-paced learner for MTL. A simple yet effective algorithm is designed for optimizing the proposed objective function. An error bound for a simplified formulation is also analyzed theoretically. Experimental results on toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  The Support Vector Machine using Privileged Information (SVM+) has been proposed to train a classifier to utilize the additional privileged information that is only available in the training phase but not available in the test phase. In this work, we propose an efficient solution for SVM+ by simply utilizing the squared hinge loss instead of the hinge loss as in the existing SVM+ formulation, which interestingly leads to a dual form with less variables and in the same form with the dual of the standard SVM. The proposed algorithm is utilized to leverage the additional web knowledge that is only available during training for the image categorization tasks. The extensive experimental results on both Caltech101 andWebQueries datasets show that our proposed method can achieve a factor of up to hundred times speedup with the comparable accuracy when compared with the existing SVM+ method."}
{"text": "  Research on manifold learning within a density ridge estimation framework has shown great potential in recent work for both estimation and de-noising of manifolds, building on the intuitive and well-defined notion of principal curves and surfaces. However, the problem of unwrapping or unfolding manifolds has received relatively little attention within the density ridge approach, despite being an integral part of manifold learning in general. This paper proposes two novel algorithms for unwrapping manifolds based on estimated principal curves and surfaces for one- and multi-dimensional manifolds respectively. The methods of unwrapping are founded in the realization that both principal curves and principal surfaces will have inherent local maxima of the probability density function. Following this observation, coordinate systems that follow the shape of the manifold can be computed by following the integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate on the manifold. Furthermore, since integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate is inherently local, we propose to stitch together local coordinate systems using parallel transport along the manifold. We provide numerical experiments on both real and synthetic data that illustrates clear and intuitive unwrapping results comparable to state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  In one-class classification problems, only the data for the target class is available, whereas the data for the non-target class may be completely absent. In this paper, we study one-class nearest neighbour (OCNN) classifiers and their different variants. We present a theoretical analysis to show the relationships among different variants of OCNN that may use different neighbours or thresholds to identify unseen examples of the non-target class. We also present a method based on inter-quartile range for optimising parameters used in OCNN in the absence of non-target data during training. Then, we propose two ensemble approaches based on random subspace and random projection methods to create accurate OCNN ensembles. We tested the proposed methods on 15 benchmark and real world domain-specific datasets and show that random-projection ensembles of OCNN perform best."}
{"text": "  We present a novel theoretical result that generalises the Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM). While originally the DRBM was defined assuming the {0, 1}-Bernoulli distribution in each of its hidden units, this result makes it possible to derive cost functions for variants of the DRBM that utilise other distributions, including some that are often encountered in the literature. This is illustrated with the Binomial and {-1, +1}-Bernoulli distributions here. We evaluate these two DRBM variants and compare them with the original one on three benchmark datasets, namely the MNIST and USPS digit classification datasets, and the 20 Newsgroups document classification dataset. Results show that each of the three compared models outperforms the remaining two in one of the three datasets, thus indicating that the proposed theoretical generalisation of the DRBM may be valuable in practice."}
{"text": "  We study the stochastic optimization of canonical correlation analysis (CCA), whose objective is nonconvex and does not decouple over training samples. Although several stochastic gradient based optimization algorithms have been recently proposed to solve this problem, no global convergence guarantee was provided by any of them. Inspired by the alternating least squares/power iterations formulation of CCA, and the shift-and-invert preconditioning method for PCA, we propose two globally convergent meta-algorithms for CCA, both of which transform the original problem into sequences of least squares problems that need only be solved approximately. We instantiate the meta-algorithms with state-of-the-art SGD methods and obtain time complexities that significantly improve upon that of previous work. Experimental results demonstrate their superior performance."}
{"text": "  Population migration is valuable information which leads to proper decision in urban-planning strategy, massive investment, and many other fields. For instance, inter-city migration is a posterior evidence to see if the government's constrain of population works, and inter-community immigration might be a prior evidence of real estate price hike. With timely data, it is also impossible to compare which city is more favorable for the people, suppose the cities release different new regulations, we could also compare the customers of different real estate development groups, where they come from, where they probably will go. Unfortunately these data was not available.   In this paper, leveraging the data generated by positioning team in Didi, we propose a novel approach that timely monitoring population migration from community scale to provincial scale. Migration can be detected as soon as in a week. It could be faster, the setting of a week is for statistical purpose. A monitoring system is developed, then applied nation wide in China, some observations derived from the system will be presented in this paper.   This new method of migration perception is origin from the insight that nowadays people mostly moving with their personal Access Point (AP), also known as WiFi hotspot. Assume that the ratio of AP moving to the migration of population is constant, analysis of comparative population migration would be feasible. More exact quantitative research would also be done with few sample research and model regression.   The procedures of processing data includes many steps: eliminating the impact of pseudo-migration AP, for instance pocket WiFi, and second-hand traded router; distinguishing moving of population with moving of companies; identifying shifting of AP by the finger print clusters, etc.."}
{"text": "  The estimation of normalizing constants is a fundamental step in probabilistic model comparison. Sequential Monte Carlo methods may be used for this task and have the advantage of being inherently parallelizable. However, the standard choice of using a fixed number of particles at each iteration is suboptimal because some steps will contribute disproportionately to the variance of the estimate. We introduce an adaptive version of the Resample-Move algorithm, in which the particle set is adaptively expanded whenever a better approximation of an intermediate distribution is needed. The algorithm builds on the expression for the optimal number of particles and the corresponding minimum variance found under ideal conditions. Benchmark results on challenging Gaussian Process Classification and Restricted Boltzmann Machine applications show that Adaptive Resample-Move (ARM) estimates the normalizing constant with a smaller variance, using less computational resources, than either Resample-Move with a fixed number of particles or Annealed Importance Sampling. A further advantage over Annealed Importance Sampling is that ARM is easier to tune."}
{"text": "  We study the sparse non-negative least squares (S-NNLS) problem. S-NNLS occurs naturally in a wide variety of applications where an unknown, non-negative quantity must be recovered from linear measurements. We present a unified framework for S-NNLS based on a rectified power exponential scale mixture prior on the sparse codes. We show that the proposed framework encompasses a large class of S-NNLS algorithms and provide a computationally efficient inference procedure based on multiplicative update rules. Such update rules are convenient for solving large sets of S-NNLS problems simultaneously, which is required in contexts like sparse non-negative matrix factorization (S-NMF). We provide theoretical justification for the proposed approach by showing that the local minima of the objective function being optimized are sparse and the S-NNLS algorithms presented are guaranteed to converge to a set of stationary points of the objective function. We then extend our framework to S-NMF, showing that our framework leads to many well known S-NMF algorithms under specific choices of prior and providing a guarantee that a popular subclass of the proposed algorithms converges to a set of stationary points of the objective function. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed approaches on synthetic and real-world data."}
{"text": "  Indefinite similarity measures can be frequently found in bio-informatics by means of alignment scores, but are also common in other fields like shape measures in image retrieval. Lacking an underlying vector space, the data are given as pairwise similarities only. The few algorithms available for such data do not scale to larger datasets. Focusing on probabilistic batch classifiers, the Indefinite Kernel Fisher Discriminant (iKFD) and the Probabilistic Classification Vector Machine (PCVM) are both effective algorithms for this type of data but, with cubic complexity. Here we propose an extension of iKFD and PCVM such that linear runtime and memory complexity is achieved for low rank indefinite kernels. Employing the Nystr\\\"om approximation for indefinite kernels, we also propose a new almost parameter free approach to identify the landmarks, restricted to a supervised learning problem. Evaluations at several larger similarity data from various domains show that the proposed methods provides similar generalization capabilities while being easier to parametrize and substantially faster for large scale data."}

Our procedure uses online convex optimization to control capital allocation to underlying investment algorithms while encouraging non-sparsity over the given grouping. We prove a logarithmic regret for this procedure with respect to the best-in-hindsight ensemble. We applied the procedure with known mean-reversion portfolio selection algorithms using the standard GICS industry sector grouping. Empirical Experimental results showed an impressive percentage increase of risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio)."}
{"text": "  Support vector machine (SVM) has been one of the most popular learning algorithms, with the central idea of maximizing the minimum margin, i.e., the smallest distance from the instances to the classification boundary. Recent theoretical results, however, disclosed that maximizing the minimum margin does not necessarily lead to better generalization performances, and instead, the margin distribution has been proven to be more crucial. Based on this idea, we propose a new method, named Optimal margin Distribution Machine (ODM), which tries to achieve a better generalization performance by optimizing the margin distribution. We characterize the margin distribution by the first- and second-order statistics, i.e., the margin mean and variance. The proposed method is a general learning approach which can be used in any place where SVM can be applied, and their superiority is verified both theoretically and empirically in this paper."}
{"text": "  While the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian ($\\mathcal{MGIG}$) distribution arises naturally in some settings as a distribution over symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, certain key properties of the distribution and effective ways of sampling from the distribution have not been carefully studied. In this paper, we show that the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ is unimodal, and the mode can be obtained by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) equation [7]. Based on the property, we propose an importance sampling method for the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ where the mode of the proposal distribution matches that of the target. The proposed sampling method is more efficient than existing approaches [32, 33], which use proposal distributions that may have the mode far from the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$'s mode. Further, we illustrate that the the posterior distribution in latent factor models, such as probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [25], when marginalized over one latent factor has the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ distribution. The characterization leads to a novel Collapsed Monte Carlo (CMC) inference algorithm for such latent factor models. We illustrate that CMC has a lower log loss or perplexity than MCMC, and needs fewer samples."}
{"text": "  In recent years, structured matrix recovery problems have gained considerable attention for its real world applications, such as recommender systems and computer vision. Much of the existing work has focused on matrices with low-rank structure, and limited progress has been made matrices with other types of structure. In this paper we present non-asymptotic analysis for estimation of generally structured matrices via the generalized Dantzig selector under generic sub-Gaussian measurements. We show that the estimation error can always be succinctly expressed in terms of a few geometric measures of suitable sets which only depend on the structure of the underlying true matrix. In addition, we derive the general bounds on these geometric measures for structures characterized by unitarily invariant norms, which is a large family covering most matrix norms of practical interest. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of our theoretical development."}
{"text": "  This paper presents the development of a passive infra-red sensor tower platform along with a classification algorithm to distinguish between human intrusion, animal intrusion and clutter arising from wind-blown vegetative movement in an outdoor environment. The research was aimed at exploring the potential use of wireless sensor networks as an early-warning system to help mitigate human-wildlife conflicts occurring at the edge of a forest. There are three important features to the development. Firstly, the sensor platform employs multiple sensors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array to give it a key spatial-resolution capability that aids in classification. Secondly, given the challenges of collecting data involving animal intrusion, an Animation-based Simulation tool for Passive Infra-Red sEnsor (ASPIRE) was developed that simulates signals corresponding to human and animal intrusion and some limited models of vegetative clutter. This speeded up the process of algorithm development by allowing us to test different hypotheses in a time-efficient manner. Finally, a chirplet-based model for intruder signal was developed that significantly helped boost classification accuracy despite drawing data from a smaller number of sensors. An SVM-based classifier was used which made use of chirplet, energy and signal cross-correlation-based features. The average accuracy obtained for intruder detection and classification on real-world and simulated data sets was in excess of 97%."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we initiate a principled study of how the generalization properties of approximate differential privacy can be used to perform adaptive hypothesis testing, while giving statistically valid $p$-value corrections. We do this by observing that the guarantees of algorithms with bounded approximate max-information are sufficient to correct the $p$-values of adaptively chosen hypotheses, and then by proving that algorithms that satisfy $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy have bounded approximate max information when their inputs are drawn from a product distribution. This substantially extends the known connection between differential privacy and max-information, which previously was only known to hold for (pure) $(\\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy. It also extends our understanding of max-information as a partially unifying measure controlling the generalization properties of adaptive data analyses. We also show a lower bound, proving that (despite the strong composition properties of max-information), when data is drawn from a product distribution, $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private algorithms can come first in a composition with other algorithms satisfying max-information bounds, but not necessarily second if the composition is required to itself satisfy a nontrivial max-information bound. This, in particular, implies that the connection between $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy and max-information holds only for inputs drawn from product distributions, unlike the connection between $(\\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy and max-information."}
{"text": "  Policy advice is a transfer learning method where a student agent is able to learn faster via advice from a teacher. However, both this and other reinforcement learning transfer methods have little theoretical analysis. This paper formally defines a setting where multiple teacher agents can provide advice to a student and introduces an algorithm to leverage both autonomous exploration and teacher's advice. Our regret bounds justify the intuition that good teachers help while bad teachers hurt. Using our formalization, we are also able to quantify, for the first time, when negative transfer can occur within such a reinforcement learning setting."}
{"text": "  With the advance of technology, entities can be observed in multiple views. Multiple views containing different types of features can be used for clustering. Although multi-view clustering has been successfully applied in many applications, the previous methods usually assume the complete instance mapping between different views. In many real-world applications, information can be gathered from multiple sources, while each source can contain multiple views, which are more cohesive for learning. The views under the same source are usually fully mapped, but they can be very heterogeneous. Moreover, the mappings between different sources are usually incomplete and partially observed, which makes it more difficult to integrate all the views across different sources. In this paper, we propose MMC (Multi-source Multi-view Clustering), which is a framework based on collective spectral clustering with a discrepancy penalty across sources, to tackle these challenges. MMC has several advantages compared with other existing methods. First, MMC can deal with incomplete mapping between sources. Second, it considers the disagreements between sources while treating views in the same source as a cohesive set. Third, MMC also tries to infer the instance similarities across sources to enhance the clustering performance. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  We consider a statistical inverse learning problem, where we observe the image of a function $f$ through a linear operator $A$ at i.i.d. random design points $X_i$, superposed with an additive noise. The distribution of the design points is unknown and can be very general. We analyze simultaneously the direct (estimation of $Af$) and the inverse (estimation of $f$) learning problems. In this general framework, we obtain strong and weak minimax optimal rates of convergence (as the number of observations $n$ grows large) for a large class of spectral regularization methods over regularity classes defined through appropriate source conditions. This improves on or completes previous results obtained in related settings. The optimality of the obtained rates is shown not only in the exponent in $n$ but also in the explicit dependency of the constant factor in the variance of the noise and the radius of the source condition set."}
{"text": "  Due to challenging applications such as collaborative filtering, the matrix completion problem has been widely studied in the past few years. Different approaches rely on different structure assumptions on the matrix in hand. Here, we focus on the completion of a (possibly) low-rank matrix with binary entries, the so-called 1-bit matrix completion problem. Our approach relies on tools from machine learning theory: empirical risk minimization and its convex relaxations. We propose an algorithm to compute a variational approximation of the pseudo-posterior. Thanks to the convex relaxation, the corresponding minimization problem is bi-convex, and thus the method behaves well in practice. We also study the performance of this variational approximation through PAC-Bayesian learning bounds. On the contrary to previous works that focused on upper bounds on the estimation error of M with various matrix norms, we are able to derive from this analysis a PAC bound on the prediction error of our algorithm.   We focus essentially on convex relaxation through the hinge loss, for which we present the complete analysis, a complete simulation study and a test on the MovieLens data set. However, we also discuss a variational approximation to deal with the logistic loss."}
{"text": "  In this article, we present the elitist particle filter based on evolutionary strategies (EPFES) as an efficient approach for nonlinear system identification. The EPFES is derived from the frequently-employed state-space model, where the relevant information of the nonlinear system is captured by an unknown state vector. Similar to classical particle filtering, the EPFES consists of a set of particles and respective weights which represent different realizations of the latent state vector and their likelihood of being the solution of the optimization problem. As main innovation, the EPFES includes an evolutionary elitist-particle selection which combines long-term information with instantaneous sampling from an approximated continuous posterior distribution. In this article, we propose two advancements of the previously-published elitist-particle selection process. Further, the EPFES is shown to be a generalization of the widely-used Gaussian particle filter and thus evaluated with respect to the latter for two completely different scenarios: First, we consider the so-called univariate nonstationary growth model with time-variant latent state variable, where the evolutionary selection of elitist particles is evaluated for non-recursively calculated particle weights. Second, the problem of nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation is addressed in a simulated scenario with speech as input signal: By using long-term fitness measures, we highlight the efficacy of the well-generalizing EPFES in estimating the nonlinear system even for large search spaces. Finally, we illustrate similarities between the EPFES and evolutionary algorithms to outline future improvements by fusing the achievements of both fields of research."}
{"text": "  Replacing a portion of current light duty vehicles (LDV) with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) offers the possibility to reduce the dependence on petroleum fuels together with environmental and economic benefits. The charging activity of PHEVs will certainly introduce new load to the power grid. In the framework of the development of a smarter grid, the primary focus of the present study is to propose a model for the electrical daily demand in presence of PHEVs charging. Expected PHEV demand is modeled by the PHEV charging time and the starting time of charge according to real world data. A normal distribution for starting time of charge is assumed. Several distributions for charging time are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive support, Rician distribution and a non-uniform distribution coming from driving patterns in real-world data. We generate daily demand profiles by using real-world residential profiles throughout 2014 in the presence of different expected PHEV demand models. Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of supervised machine learning models, are employed in order to find the best model to fit the data. SVMs with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels were tested. Model performances are evaluated by means of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Best results are obtained with RBF kernel: maximum (worst) values for MSE and MAPE were about 2.89 10-8 and 0.023, respectively."}
{"text": "  Time-varying mixture densities occur in many scenarios, for example, the distributions of keywords that appear in publications may evolve from year to year, video frame features associated with multiple targets may evolve in a sequence. Any models that realistically cater to this phenomenon must exhibit two important properties: the underlying mixture densities must have an unknown number of mixtures, and there must be some \"smoothness\" constraints in place for the adjacent mixture densities. The traditional Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) may be suited to the first property, but certainly not the second. This is due to how each random measure in the lower hierarchies is sampled independent of each other and hence does not facilitate any temporal correlations. To overcome such shortcomings, we proposed a new Smoothed Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (sHDP). The key novelty of this model is that we place a temporal constraint amongst the nearby discrete measures $\\{G_j\\}$ in the form of symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence with a fixed bound $B$. Although the constraint we place only involves a single scalar value, it nonetheless allows for flexibility in the corresponding successive measures. Remarkably, it also led us to infer the model within the stick-breaking process where the traditional Beta distribution used in stick-breaking is now replaced by a new constraint calculated from $B$. We present the inference algorithm and elaborate on its solutions. Our experiment using NIPS keywords has shown the desirable effect of the model."}
{"text": "  With the massive data challenges nowadays and the rapid growing of technology, stream mining has recently received considerable attention. To address the large number of scenarios in which this phenomenon manifests itself suitable tools are required in various research fields. Instance-based data stream algorithms generally employ the Euclidean distance for the classification task underlying this problem. A novel way to look into this issue is to take advantage of a more flexible metric due to the increased requirements imposed by the data stream scenario. In this paper we present a new algorithm that learns a Mahalanobis metric using similarity and dissimilarity constraints in an online manner. This approach hybridizes a Mahalanobis distance metric learning algorithm and a k-NN data stream classification algorithm with concept drift detection. First, some basic aspects of Mahalanobis distance metric learning are described taking into account key properties as well as online distance metric learning algorithms. Second, we implement specific evaluation methodologies and comparative metrics such as Q statistic for data stream classification algorithms. Finally, our algorithm is evaluated on different datasets by comparing its results with one of the best instance-based data stream classification algorithm of the state of the art. The results demonstrate that our proposal is better"}
{"text": "  The multi-armed bandit problems have been studied mainly under the measure of expected total reward accrued over a horizon of length $T$. In this paper, we address the issue of risk in multi-armed bandit problems and develop parallel results under the measure of mean-variance, a commonly adopted risk measure in economics and mathematical finance. We show that the model-specific regret and the model-independent regret in terms of the mean-variance of the reward process are lower bounded by $\\Omega(\\log T)$ and $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$, respectively. We then show that variations of the UCB policy and the DSEE policy developed for the classic risk-neutral MAB achieve these lower bounds."}
{"text": "  The paper presents a comparative study of the performance of Back Propagation and Instance Based Learning Algorithm for classification tasks. The study is carried out by a series of experiments will all possible combinations of parameter values for the algorithms under evaluation. The algorithm's classification accuracy is compared over a range of datasets and measurements like Cross Validation, Kappa Statistics, Root Mean Squared Value and True Positive vs False Positive rate have been used to evaluate their performance. Along with performance comparison, techniques of handling missing values have also been compared that include Mean or Mode replacement and Multiple Imputation. The results showed that parameter adjustment plays vital role in improving an algorithm's accuracy and therefore, Back Propagation has shown better results as compared to Instance Based Learning. Furthermore, the problem of missing values was better handled by Multiple imputation method, however, not suitable for less amount of data."}
{"text": "  Orthogonal greedy learning (OGL) is a stepwise learning scheme that starts with selecting a new atom from a specified dictionary via the steepest gradient descent (SGD) and then builds the estimator through orthogonal projection. In this paper, we find that SGD is not the unique greedy criterion and introduce a new greedy criterion, called \"$\\delta$-greedy threshold\" for learning. Based on the new greedy criterion, we derive an adaptive termination rule for OGL. Our theoretical study shows that the new learning scheme can achieve the existing (almost) optimal learning rate of OGL. Plenty of numerical experiments are provided to support that the new scheme can achieve almost optimal generalization performance, while requiring less computation than OGL."}
{"text": "  We introduce sparse random projection, an important dimension-reduction tool from machine learning, for the estimation of discrete-choice models with high-dimensional choice sets. Initially, high-dimensional data are compressed into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using random projections. Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclic monotonicity moment inequalities implied by the multinomial choice model; the estimation procedure is semi-parametric and does not require explicit distributional assumptions to be made regarding the random utility errors. The random projection procedure is justified via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma -- the pairwise distances between data points are preserved during data compression, which we exploit to show convergence of our estimator. The estimator works well in simulations and in an application to a supermarket scanner dataset."}
{"text": "  Many machine learning methods can produce variable importance scores expressing the usability of each feature in context of the produced model; those scores on their own are yet not sufficient to generate feature selection, especially when an all relevant selection is required. Although there are wrapper methods aiming to solve this problem, they introduce a substantial increase in the required computational effort.   In this paper I investigate an idea of incorporating all relevant selection within the training process by producing importance for implicitly generated shadows, attributes irrelevant by design. I propose and evaluate such a method in context of random ferns classifier. Experiment results confirm the effectiveness of such approach, although show that fully stochastic nature of random ferns limits its applicability either to small dimensions or as a part of a broader feature selection procedure."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a new discriminative model named \\emph{nonextensive information theoretical machine (NITM)} based on nonextensive generalization of Shannon information theory. In NITM, weight parameters are treated as random variables. Tsallis divergence is used to regularize the distribution of weight parameters and maximum unnormalized Tsallis entropy distribution is used to evaluate fitting effect. On the one hand, it is showed that some well-known margin-based loss functions such as $\\ell_{0/1}$ loss, hinge loss, squared hinge loss and exponential loss can be unified by unnormalized Tsallis entropy. On the other hand, Gaussian prior regularization is generalized to Student-t prior regularization with similar computational complexity. The model can be solved efficiently by gradient-based convex optimization and its performance is illustrated on standard datasets."}
{"text": "  This paper studies classification with an abstention option in the online setting. In this setting, examples arrive sequentially, the learner is given a hypothesis class $\\mathcal H$, and the goal of the learner is to either predict a label on each example or abstain, while ensuring that it does not make more than a pre-specified number of mistakes when it does predict a label.   Previous work on this problem has left open two main challenges. First, not much is known about the optimality of algorithms, and in particular, about what an optimal algorithmic strategy is for any individual hypothesis class. Second, while the realizable case has been studied, the more realistic non-realizable scenario is not well-understood. In this paper, we address both challenges. First, we provide a novel measure, called the Extended Littlestone's Dimension, which captures the number of abstentions needed to ensure a certain number of mistakes. Second, we explore the non-realizable case, and provide upper and lower bounds on the number of abstentions required by an algorithm to guarantee a specified number of mistakes."}
{"text": "  We propose a systematic approach to reduce the memory consumption of deep neural network training. Specifically, we design an algorithm that costs O(sqrt(n)) memory to train a n layer network, with only the computational cost of an extra forward pass per mini-batch. As many of the state-of-the-art models hit the upper bound of the GPU memory, our algorithm allows deeper and more complex models to be explored, and helps advance the innovations in deep learning research. We focus on reducing the memory cost to store the intermediate feature maps and gradients during training. Computation graph analysis is used for automatic in-place operation and memory sharing optimizations. We show that it is possible to trade computation for memory - giving a more memory efficient training algorithm with a little extra computation cost. In the extreme case, our analysis also shows that the memory consumption can be reduced to O(log n) with as little as O(n log n) extra cost for forward computation. Our experiments show that we can reduce the memory cost of a 1,000-layer deep residual network from 48G to 7G with only 30 percent additional running time cost on ImageNet problems. Similarly, significant memory cost reduction is observed in training complex recurrent neural networks on very long sequences."}
{"text": "  Many real-world clustering problems are plagued by incomplete data characterized by missing or absent features for some or all of the data instances. Traditional clustering methods cannot be directly applied to such data without preprocessing by imputation or marginalization techniques. In this article, we overcome this drawback by utilizing a penalized dissimilarity measure which we refer to as the Feature Weighted Penalty based Dissimilarity (FWPD). Using the FWPD measure, we modify the traditional k-means clustering algorithm and the standard hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms so as to make them directly applicable to datasets with missing features. We present time complexity analyses for these new techniques and also undertake a detailed theoretical analysis showing that the new FWPD based k-means algorithm converges to a local optimum within a finite number of iterations. We also present a detailed method for simulating random as well as feature dependent missingness. We report extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets for different types of missingness showing that the proposed clustering techniques have generally better results compared to some of the most well-known imputation methods which are commonly used to handle such incomplete data. We append a possible extension of the proposed dissimilarity measure to the case of absent features (where the unobserved features are known to be undefined)."}
{"text": "  We map categorical variables in a function approximation problem into Euclidean spaces, which are the entity embeddings of the categorical variables. The mapping is learned by a neural network during the standard supervised training process. Entity embedding not only reduces memory usage and speeds up neural networks compared with one-hot encoding, but more importantly by mapping similar values close to each other in the embedding space it reveals the intrinsic properties of the categorical variables. We applied it successfully in a recent Kaggle competition and were able to reach the third position with relative simple features. We further demonstrate in this paper that entity embedding helps the neural network to generalize better when the data is sparse and statistics is unknown. Thus it is especially useful for datasets with lots of high cardinality features, where other methods tend to overfit. We also demonstrate that the embeddings obtained from the trained neural network boost the performance of all tested machine learning methods considerably when used as the input features instead. As entity embedding defines a distance measure for categorical variables it can be used for visualizing categorical data and for data clustering."}

{"text": "  Sum-Product Networks with complex probability distribution at the leaves have been shown to be powerful tractable-inference probabilistic models. However, while learning the internal parameters has been amply studied, learning complex leaf distribution is an open problem with only few results available in special cases. In this paper we derive an efficient method to learn a very large class of leaf distributions with Expectation-Maximization. The EM updates have the form of simple weighted maximum likelihood problems, allowing to use any distribution that can be learned with maximum likelihood, even approximately. The algorithm has cost linear in the model size and converges even if only partial optimizations are performed. We demonstrate this approach with experiments on twenty real-life datasets for density estimation, using tree graphical models as leaves. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for parameter learning despite using SPNs with much fewer parameters."}
{"text": "  We consider a firm that sells products over $T$ periods without knowing the demand function. The firm sequentially sets prices to earn revenue and to learn the underlying demand function simultaneously. A natural heuristic for this problem, commonly used in practice, is greedy iterative least squares (GILS). At each time period, GILS estimates the demand as a linear function of the price by applying least squares to the set of prior prices and realized demands. Then a price that maximizes the revenue, given the estimated demand function, is used for the next time period. The performance is measured by the regret, which is the expected revenue loss from the optimal (oracle) pricing policy when the demand function is known. Recently, den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014) demonstrated that GILS is sub-optimal. They introduced algorithms which integrate forced price dispersion with GILS and achieve asymptotically optimal performance.   In this paper, we consider this dynamic pricing problem in a data-rich environment. In particular, we assume that the firm knows the expected demand under a particular price from historical data, and in each period, before setting the price, the firm has access to extra information (demand covariates) which may be predictive of the demand. We prove that in this setting GILS achieves asymptotically optimal regret of order $\\log(T)$. We also show the following surprising result: in the original dynamic pricing problem of den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014), inclusion of any set of covariates in GILS as potential demand covariates (even though they could carry no information) would make GILS asymptotically optimal. We validate our results via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "  We discuss a method to improve the exact F-measure maximization algorithm called GFM, proposed in (Dembczynski et al. 2011) for multi-label classification, assuming the label set can be can partitioned into conditionally independent subsets given the input features. If the labels were all independent, the estimation of only $m$ parameters ($m$ denoting the number of labels) would suffice to derive Bayes-optimal predictions in $O(m^2)$ operations. In the general case, $m^2+1$ parameters are required by GFM, to solve the problem in $O(m^3)$ operations. In this work, we show that the number of parameters can be reduced further to $m^2/n$, in the best case, assuming the label set can be partitioned into $n$ conditionally independent subsets. As this label partition needs to be estimated from the data beforehand, we use first the procedure proposed in (Gasse et al. 2015) that finds such partition and then infer the required parameters locally in each label subset. The latter are aggregated and serve as input to GFM to form the Bayes-optimal prediction. We show on a synthetic experiment that the reduction in the number of parameters brings about significant benefits in terms of performance."}

In this work, we compare renowned distances between distributions: the Fisher-Rao geodesic distance, related divergences and optimal transport, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Applications of such methodology can be found in the clustering of financial assets. A tutorial, experiments and implementation for reproducible research can be found at www.datagrapple.com/Tech."}
{"text": "  Sparse generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) plays a pivotal role in a large family of high-dimensional statistical models, including sparse Fisher's discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and sufficient dimension reduction. Sparse GEP involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. Most existing methods and theory in the context of specific statistical models that are special cases of the sparse GEP require restrictive structural assumptions on the input matrices. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational framework to solve the sparse GEP. At the first stage, we solve a convex relaxation of the sparse GEP. Taking the solution as an initial value, we then exploit a nonconvex optimization perspective and propose the truncated Rayleigh flow method (Rifle) to estimate the leading generalized eigenvector. We show that Rifle converges linearly to a solution with the optimal statistical rate of convergence for many statistical models. Theoretically, our method significantly improves upon the existing literature by eliminating structural assumptions on the input matrices for both stages. To achieve this, our analysis involves two key ingredients: (i) a new analysis of the gradient based method on nonconvex objective functions, and (ii) a fine-grained characterization of the evolution of sparsity patterns along the solution path. Thorough numerical studies are provided to validate the theoretical results."}
{"text": "  In online convex optimization it is well known that certain subclasses of objective functions are much easier than arbitrary convex functions. We are interested in designing adaptive methods that can automatically get fast rates in as many such subclasses as possible, without any manual tuning. Previous adaptive methods are able to interpolate between strongly convex and general convex functions. We present a new method, MetaGrad, that adapts to a much broader class of functions, including exp-concave and strongly convex functions, but also various types of stochastic and non-stochastic functions without any curvature. For instance, MetaGrad can achieve logarithmic regret on the unregularized hinge loss, even though it has no curvature, if the data come from a favourable probability distribution. MetaGrad's main feature is that it simultaneously considers multiple learning rates. Unlike previous methods with provable regret guarantees, however, its learning rates are not monotonically decreasing over time and are not tuned based on a theoretically derived bound on the regret. Instead, they are weighted directly proportional to their empirical performance on the data using a tilted exponential weights master algorithm."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we aim at developing scalable neural network-type learning systems. Motivated by the idea of \"constructive neural networks\" in approximation theory, we focus on \"constructing\" rather than \"training\" feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) for learning, and propose a novel FNNs learning system called the constructive feed-forward neural network (CFN). Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method not only overcomes the classical saturation problem for FNN approximation, but also reaches the optimal learning rate when the regression function is smooth, while the state-of-the-art learning rates established for traditional FNNs are only near optimal (up to a logarithmic factor). A series of numerical simulations are provided to show the efficiency and feasibility of CFN via comparing with the well-known regularized least squares (RLS) with Gaussian kernel and extreme learning machine (ELM)."}
{"text": "  Many sequential decision-making problems in communication networks can be modeled as contextual bandit problems, which are natural extensions of the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. In contextual bandit problems, at each time, an agent observes some side information or context, pulls one arm and receives the reward for that arm. We consider a stochastic formulation where the context-reward tuples are independently drawn from an unknown distribution in each trial. Motivated by networking applications, we analyze a setting where the reward is a known non-linear function of the context and the chosen arm's current state. We first consider the case of discrete and finite context-spaces and propose DCB($\\epsilon$), an algorithm that we prove, through a careful analysis, yields regret (cumulative reward gap compared to a distribution-aware genie) scaling logarithmically in time and linearly in the number of arms that are not optimal for any context, improving over existing algorithms where the regret scales linearly in the total number of arms. We then study continuous context-spaces with Lipschitz reward functions and propose CCB($\\epsilon, \\delta$), an algorithm that uses DCB($\\epsilon$) as a subroutine. CCB($\\epsilon, \\delta$) reveals a novel regret-storage trade-off that is parametrized by $\\delta$. Tuning $\\delta$ to the time horizon allows us to obtain sub-linear regret bounds, while requiring sub-linear storage. By exploiting joint learning for all contexts we get regret bounds for CCB($\\epsilon, \\delta$) that are unachievable by any existing contextual bandit algorithm for continuous context-spaces. We also show similar performance bounds for the unknown horizon case."}

Consequently, statistical and machine learning models tailored to different data encodings are important. We focus on data encoded as normalized vectors, so that their \"direction\" is more important than their magnitude. Specifically, we consider high-dimensional vectors that lie either on the surface of the unit hypersphere or on the real projective plane. For such data, we briefly review common mathematical models prevalent in machine learning, while also outlining some technical aspects, software, applications, and open mathematical challenges."}
{"text": "  Neural networks have been successfully used for classification tasks in a rapidly growing number of practical applications. Despite their popularity and widespread use, there are still many aspects of training and classification that are not well understood. In this paper we aim to provide some new insights into training and classification by analyzing neural networks from a feature-space perspective. We review and explain the formation of decision regions and study some of their combinatorial aspects. We place a particular emphasis on the connections between the neural network weight and bias terms and properties of decision boundaries and other regions that exhibit varying levels of classification confidence. We show how the error backpropagates in these regions and emphasize the important role they have in the formation of gradients. These findings expose the connections between scaling of the weight parameters and the density of the training samples. This sheds more light on the vanishing gradient problem, explains the need for regularization, and suggests an approach for subsampling training data to improve performance."}
{"text": "  Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are probabilistic tools of choice for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables in complex systems. Finding changepoints in the structural evolution of a GGM is therefore essential to detecting anomalies in the underlying system modeled by the GGM. In order to detect structural anomalies in a GGM, we consider the problem of estimating changes in the precision matrix of the corresponding Gaussian distribution. We take a two-step approach to solving this problem:- (i) estimating a background precision matrix using system observations from the past without any anomalies, and (ii) estimating a foreground precision matrix using a sliding temporal window during anomaly monitoring. Our primary contribution is in estimating the foreground precision using a novel contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure. In order to accurately learn only the structural changes to the GGM, we maximize a penalized log-likelihood where the penalty is the $l_1$ norm of difference between the foreground precision being estimated and the already learned background precision. We modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for sparse inverse covariance estimation to perform contrastive estimation of the foreground precision matrix. Our results on simulated GGM data show significant improvement in precision and recall for detecting structural changes to the GGM, compared to a non-contrastive sliding window baseline."}
{"text": "  Separating the short jobs from the long is a known technique to improve scheduling performance. In this paper we describe a method we developed for accurately predicting the runtimes classes of the jobs to enable this separation. Our method uses the fact that the runtimes can be represented as a mixture of overlapping Gaussian distributions, in order to train a CART classifier to provide the prediction. The threshold that separates the short jobs from the long jobs is determined during the evaluation of the classifier to maximize prediction accuracy. Our results indicate overall accuracy of 90% for the data set used in our study, with sensitivity and specificity both above 90%."}
{"text": "  Distributional (or distribution-valued) data are a new type of data arising from several sources and are considered as realizations of distributional variables. A new set of fuzzy c-means algorithms for data described by distributional variables is proposed.   The algorithms use the $L2$ Wasserstein distance between distributions as dissimilarity measures. Beside the extension of the fuzzy c-means algorithm for distributional data, and considering a decomposition of the squared $L2$ Wasserstein distance, we propose a set of algorithms using different automatic way to compute the weights associated with the variables as well as with their components, globally or cluster-wise. The relevance weights are computed in the clustering process introducing product-to-one constraints.   The relevance weights induce adaptive distances expressing the importance of each variable or of each component in the clustering process, acting also as a variable selection method in clustering. We have tested the proposed algorithms on artificial and real-world data. Results confirm that the proposed methods are able to better take into account the cluster structure of the data with respect to the standard fuzzy c-means, with non-adaptive distances."}
{"text": "  Suppose we have a sample of instances paired with binary labels corrupted by arbitrary instance- and label-dependent noise. With sufficiently many such samples, can we optimally classify and rank instances with respect to the noise-free distribution? We provide a theoretical analysis of this question, with three main contributions. First, we prove that for instance-dependent noise, any algorithm that is consistent for classification on the noisy distribution is also consistent on the clean distribution. Second, we prove that for a broad class of instance- and label-dependent noise, a similar consistency result holds for the area under the ROC curve. Third, for the latter noise model, when the noise-free class-probability function belongs to the generalised linear model family, we show that the Isotron can efficiently and provably learn from the corrupted sample."}

From a theoret- ical perspective, it assesses their employability for a particular function approximation problem where the analytical models fall short.

Finally, this thesis work evaluates the implemented learning algorithms according to various evaluation criteria through rigorous testing."}
{"text": "  This paper applies a deep convolutional/highway MLP framework to classify genomic sequences on the transcription factor binding site task. To make the model understandable, we propose an optimization driven strategy to extract \"motifs\", or symbolic patterns which visualize the positive class learned by the network. We show that our system, Deep Motif (DeMo), extracts motifs that are similar to, and in some cases outperform the current well known motifs. In addition, we find that a deeper model consisting of multiple convolutional and highway layers can outperform a single convolutional and fully connected layer in the previous state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "  We present an algorithm for the statistical learning setting with a bounded exp-concave loss in $d$ dimensions that obtains excess risk $O(d \\log(1/\\delta)/n)$ with probability at least $1 - \\delta$. The core technique is to boost the confidence of recent in-expectation $O(d/n)$ excess risk bounds for empirical risk minimization (ERM), without sacrificing the rate, by leveraging a Bernstein condition which holds due to exp-concavity. We also show that with probability $1 - \\delta$ the standard ERM method obtains excess risk $O(d (\\log(n) + \\log(1/\\delta))/n)$. We further show that a regret bound for any online learner in this setting translates to a high probability excess risk bound for the corresponding online-to-batch conversion of the online learner. Lastly, we present two high probability bounds for the exp-concave model selection aggregation problem that are quantile-adaptive in a certain sense. The first bound is a purely exponential weights type algorithm, obtains a nearly optimal rate, and has no explicit dependence on the Lipschitz continuity of the loss. The second bound requires Lipschitz continuity but obtains the optimal rate."}
{"text": "  Controlled interventions provide the most direct source of information for learning causal effects. In particular, a dose-response curve can be learned by varying the treatment level and observing the corresponding outcomes. However, interventions can be expensive and time-consuming. Observational data, where the treatment is not controlled by a known mechanism, is sometimes available. Under some strong assumptions, observational data allows for the estimation of dose-response curves. Estimating such curves nonparametrically is hard: sample sizes for controlled interventions may be small, while in the observational case a large number of measured confounders may need to be marginalized. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical Gaussian process prior that constructs a distribution over the dose-response curve by learning from observational data, and reshapes the distribution with a nonparametric affine transform learned from controlled interventions. This function composition from different sources is shown to speed-up learning, which we demonstrate with a thorough sensitivity analysis and an application to modeling the effect of therapy on cognitive skills of premature infants."}
{"text": "  The convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) using convex loss functions has been widely studied. However, vanilla SGD methods using convex losses cannot perform well with noisy labels, which adversely affect the update of the primal variable in SGD methods. Unfortunately, noisy labels are ubiquitous in real world applications such as crowdsourcing. To handle noisy labels, in this paper, we present a family of robust losses for SGD methods. By employing our robust losses, SGD methods successfully reduce negative effects caused by noisy labels on each update of the primal variable. We not only reveal that the convergence rate is O(1/T) for SGD methods using robust losses, but also provide the robustness analysis on two representative robust losses. Comprehensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show that SGD methods using robust losses are obviously more robust than other baseline methods in most situations with fast convergence."}
{"text": "  The iterations of many sparse estimation algorithms are comprised of a fixed linear filter cascaded with a thresholding nonlinearity, which collectively resemble a typical neural network layer. Consequently, a lengthy sequence of algorithm iterations can be viewed as a deep network with shared, hand-crafted layer weights. It is therefore quite natural to examine the degree to which a learned network model might act as a viable surrogate for traditional sparse estimation in domains where ample training data is available. While the possibility of a reduced computational budget is readily apparent when a ceiling is imposed on the number of layers, our work primarily focuses on estimation accuracy. In particular, it is well-known that when a signal dictionary has coherent columns, as quantified by a large RIP constant, then most tractable iterative algorithms are unable to find maximally sparse representations. In contrast, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically the potential for a trained deep network to recover minimal $\\ell_0$-norm representations in regimes where existing methods fail. The resulting system is deployed on a practical photometric stereo estimation problem, where the goal is to remove sparse outliers that can disrupt the estimation of surface normals from a 3D scene."}
{"text": "  With the recent popularity of graphical clustering methods, there has been an increased focus on the information between samples. We show how learning cluster structure using edge features naturally and simultaneously determines the most likely number of clusters and addresses data scale issues. These results are particularly useful in instances where (a) there are a large number of clusters and (b) we have some labeled edges. Applications in this domain include image segmentation, community discovery and entity resolution. Our model is an extension of the planted partition model and our solution uses results of correlation clustering, which achieves a partition O(log(n))-close to the log-likelihood of the true clustering."}
{"text": "  Cross-graph Relational Learning (CGRL) refers to the problem of predicting the strengths or labels of multi-relational tuples of heterogeneous object types, through the joint inference over multiple graphs which specify the internal connections among each type of objects. CGRL is an open challenge in machine learning due to the daunting number of all possible tuples to deal with when the numbers of nodes in multiple graphs are large, and because the labeled training instances are extremely sparse as typical. Existing methods such as tensor factorization or tensor-kernel machines do not work well because of the lack of convex formulation for the optimization of CGRL models, the poor scalability of the algorithms in handling combinatorial numbers of tuples, and/or the non-transductive nature of the learning methods which limits their ability to leverage unlabeled data in training. This paper proposes a novel framework which formulates CGRL as a convex optimization problem, enables transductive learning using both labeled and unlabeled tuples, and offers a scalable algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution and enjoys a linear time complexity with respect to the sizes of input graphs. In our experiments with a subset of DBLP publication records and an Enzyme multi-source dataset, the proposed method successfully scaled to the large cross-graph inference problem, and outperformed other representative approaches significantly."}
{"text": "  With the growing importance of large network models and enormous training datasets, GPUs have become increasingly necessary to train neural networks. This is largely because conventional optimization algorithms rely on stochastic gradient methods that don't scale well to large numbers of cores in a cluster setting. Furthermore, the convergence of all gradient methods, including batch methods, suffers from common problems like saturation effects, poor conditioning, and saddle points. This paper explores an unconventional training method that uses alternating direction methods and Bregman iteration to train networks without gradient descent steps. The proposed method reduces the network training problem to a sequence of minimization sub-steps that can each be solved globally in closed form. The proposed method is advantageous because it avoids many of the caveats that make gradient methods slow on highly non-convex problems. The method exhibits strong scaling in the distributed setting, yielding linear speedups even when split over thousands of cores."}
{"text": "  This is a companion note to our recent study of the weak convergence properties of constrained emphatic temporal-difference learning (ETD) algorithms from a theoretic perspective.

{"text": "  Biological systems are often modelled at different levels of abstraction depending on the particular aims/resources of a study. Such different models often provide qualitatively concordant predictions over specific parametrisations, but it is generally unclear whether model predictions are quantitatively in agreement, and whether such agreement holds for different parametrisations. Here we present a generally applicable statistical machine learning methodology to automatically reconcile the predictions of different models across abstraction levels. Our approach is based on defining a correction map, a random function which modifies the output of a model in order to match the statistics of the output of a different model of the same system. We use two biological examples to give a proof-of-principle demonstration of the methodology, and discuss its advantages and potential further applications."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of how to distribute the training of large-scale deep learning models in the parallel computing environment. We propose a new distributed stochastic optimization method called Elastic Averaging SGD (EASGD). We analyze the convergence rate of the EASGD method in the synchronous scenario and compare its stability condition with the existing ADMM method in the round-robin scheme. An asynchronous and momentum variant of the EASGD method is applied to train deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Our approach accelerates the training and furthermore achieves better test accuracy. It also requires a much smaller amount of communication than other common baseline approaches such as the DOWNPOUR method.   We then investigate the limit in speedup of the initial and the asymptotic phase of the mini-batch SGD, the momentum SGD, and the EASGD methods. We find that the spread of the input data distribution has a big impact on their initial convergence rate and stability region. We also find a surprising connection between the momentum SGD and the EASGD method with a negative moving average rate. A non-convex case is also studied to understand when EASGD can get trapped by a saddle point.   Finally, we scale up the EASGD method by using a tree structured network topology. We show empirically its advantage and challenge. We also establish a connection between the EASGD and the DOWNPOUR method with the classical Jacobi and the Gauss-Seidel method, thus unifying a class of distributed stochastic optimization methods."}
{"text": "  We present Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) models, which are neural network architectures applied to the problem of unsupervised distribution and density estimation. They leverage the probability product rule and a weight sharing scheme inspired from restricted Boltzmann machines, to yield an estimator that is both tractable and has good generalization performance. We discuss how they achieve competitive performance in modeling both binary and real-valued observations. We also present how deep NADE models can be trained to be agnostic to the ordering of input dimensions used by the autoregressive product rule decomposition. Finally, we also show how to exploit the topological structure of pixels in images using a deep convolutional architecture for NADE."}
{"text": "  We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We prove the existence of an optimal MAPE model and we show the universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization based on the MAPE. We also show that finding the best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression, and we apply this weighting strategy to kernel regression. The behavior of the MAPE kernel regression is illustrated on simulated data."}
{"text": "  Multivariate Analysis (MVA) comprises a family of well-known methods for feature extraction that exploit correlations among input variables of the data representation. One important property that is enjoyed by most such methods is uncorrelation among the extracted features. Recently, regularized versions of MVA methods have appeared in the literature, mainly with the goal to gain interpretability of the solution. In these cases, the solutions can no longer be obtained in a closed manner, and it is frequent to recur to the iteration of two steps, one of them being an orthogonal Procrustes problem. This letter shows that the Procrustes solution is not optimal from the perspective of the overall MVA method, and proposes an alternative approach based on the solution of an eigenvalue problem. Our method ensures the preservation of several properties of the original methods, most notably the uncorrelation of the extracted features, as demonstrated theoretically and through a collection of selected experiments."}
{"text": "  Predicting protein properties such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure from its primary amino acid sequence is an important task in bioinformatics. Recently, a few deep learning models have surpassed the traditional window based multilayer perceptron. Taking inspiration from the image classification domain we propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture, MUST-CNN, to predict protein properties. This architecture uses a novel multilayer shift-and-stitch (MUST) technique to generate fully dense per-position predictions on protein sequences. Our model is significantly simpler than the state-of-the-art, yet achieves better results. By combining MUST and the efficient convolution operation, we can consider far more parameters while retaining very fast prediction speeds. We beat the state-of-the-art performance on two large protein property prediction datasets."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose a new method to predict the final destination of vehicle trips based on their initial partial trajectories. We first review how we obtained clustering of trajectories that describes user behaviour. Then, we explain how we model main traffic flow patterns by a mixture of 2d Gaussian distributions. This yielded a density based clustering of locations, which produces a data driven grid of similar points within each pattern. We present how this model can be used to predict the final destination of a new trajectory based on their first locations using a two step procedure: We first assign the new trajectory to the clusters it mot likely belongs. Secondly, we use characteristics from trajectories inside these clusters to predict the final destination. Finally, we present experimental results of our methods for classification of trajectories and final destination prediction on datasets of timestamped GPS-Location of taxi trips. We test our methods on two different datasets, to assess the capacity of our method to adapt automatically to different subsets."}
{"text": "  A very simple interpretation of matrix completion problem is introduced based on statistical models. Combined with the well-known results from missing data analysis, such interpretation indicates that matrix completion is still a valid and principled estimation procedure even without the missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption, which almost all of the current theoretical studies of matrix completion assume."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present a new algorithm for semi-supervised representation learning. In this algorithm, we first find a vector representation for the labels of the data points based on their local positions in the space. Then, we map the data to lower-dimensional space using a linear transformation such that the dependency between the transformed data and the assigned labels is maximized. In fact, we try to find a mapping that is as discriminative as possible. The approach will use Hilber-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as the dependence measure. We also present a kernelized version of the algorithm, which allows non-linear transformations and provides more flexibility in finding the appropriate mapping. Use of unlabeled data for learning new representation is not always beneficial and there is no algorithm that can deterministically guarantee the improvement of the performance by exploiting unlabeled data. Therefore, we also propose a bound on the performance of the algorithm, which can be used to determine the effectiveness of using the unlabeled data in the algorithm. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithm in finding the transformation using both toy examples and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "  Structural equation models (SEMs) have been widely adopted for inference of causal interactions in complex networks. Recent examples include unveiling topologies of hidden causal networks over which processes such as spreading diseases, or rumors propagate. The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from their simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear dependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent to adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which account for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The advocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for nonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put forth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a convex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to proximal-splitting optimization methods. To this end, solvers with complementary merits are developed by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers, and proximal gradient iterations. Experiments conducted on simulated data demonstrate that the novel approach outperforms linear SEMs with respect to edge detection errors. Furthermore, tests on a real gene expression dataset unveil interesting new edges that were not revealed by linear SEMs, which could shed more light on regulatory behavior of human genes."}
{"text": "  We present a new method for estimating multivariate, second-order stationary Gaussian Random Field (GRF) models based on the Sparse Precision matrix Selection (SPS) algorithm, proposed by Davanloo et al. (2015) for estimating scalar GRF models. Theoretical convergence rates for the estimated between-response covariance matrix and for the estimated parameters of the underlying spatial correlation function are established. Numerical tests using simulated and real datasets validate our theoretical findings. Data segmentation is used to handle large data sets."}
{"text": "  Given two possible treatments, there may exist subgroups who benefit greater from one treatment than the other. This problem is relevant to the field of marketing, where treatments may correspond to different ways of selling a product. It is similarly relevant to the field of public policy, where treatments may correspond to specific government programs. And finally, personalized medicine is a field wholly devoted to understanding which subgroups of individuals will benefit from particular medical treatments. We present a computationally fast tree-based method, ABtree, for treatment effect differentiation. Unlike other methods, ABtree specifically produces decision rules for optimal treatment assignment on a per-individual basis. The treatment choices are selected for maximizing the overall occurrence of a desired binary outcome, conditional on a set of covariates. In this poster, we present the methodology on tree growth and pruning, and show performance results when applied to simulated data as well as real data."}
{"text": "  This volume is a collection of contributions from the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Interpretation in Neuroimaging (MLINI) at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015) conference. Modern multivariate statistical methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state detection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysis methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional signals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category of a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental disorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate approaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual imaging measurement in isolation.   We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how questions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is now entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally important that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly evolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, there is an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context of rich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specific paradigms that pinpoint a single function, towards schemes for measuring the interaction with natural and more varied scene are made. The goal of the workshop is to pinpoint the most pressing issues and common challenges across the neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology and machine learning fields, and to sketch future directions and open questions in the light of novel methodology."}
{"text": "  Many complex ecosystems, such as those formed by multiple microbial taxa, involve intricate interactions amongst various sub-communities. The most basic relationships are frequently modeled as co-occurrence networks in which the nodes represent the various players in the community and the weighted edges encode levels of interaction. In this setting, the composition of a community may be viewed as a probability distribution on the nodes of the network. This paper develops methods for modeling the organization of such data, as well as their Euclidean counterparts, across spatial scales. Using the notion of diffusion distance, we introduce diffusion Frechet functions and diffusion Frechet vectors associated with probability distributions on Euclidean space and the vertex set of a weighted network, respectively. We prove that these functional statistics are stable with respect to the Wasserstein distance between probability measures, thus yielding robust descriptors of their shapes. We apply the methodology to investigate bacterial communities in the human gut, seeking to characterize divergence from intestinal homeostasis in patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation, a treatment used in CDI patients that has proven to be significantly more effective than traditional treatment with antibiotics. The proposed method proves useful in deriving a biomarker that might help elucidate the mechanisms that drive these processes."}
{"text": "  Due to its ability to combine multiple base clusterings into a probably better and more robust clustering, the ensemble clustering technique has been attracting increasing attention in recent years. Despite the significant success, one limitation to most of the existing ensemble clustering methods is that they generally treat all base clusterings equally regardless of their reliability, which makes them vulnerable to low-quality base clusterings. Although some efforts have been made to (globally) evaluate and weight the base clusterings, yet these methods tend to view each base clustering as an individual and neglect the local diversity of clusters inside the same base clustering. It remains an open problem how to evaluate the reliability of clusters and exploit the local diversity in the ensemble to enhance the consensus performance, especially in the case when there is no access to data features or specific assumptions on data distribution. To address this, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on ensemble-driven cluster uncertainty estimation and local weighting strategy. In particular, the uncertainty of each cluster is estimated by considering the cluster labels in the entire ensemble via an entropic criterion. A novel ensemble-driven cluster validity measure is introduced, and a locally weighted co-association matrix is presented to serve as a summary for the ensemble of diverse clusters. With the local diversity in ensembles exploited, two novel consensus functions are further proposed. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "  We analyze the performance of the top-down multiclass classification algorithm for decision tree learning called LOMtree, recently proposed in the literature Choromanska and Langford (2014) for solving efficiently classification problems with very large number of classes. The algorithm online optimizes the objective function which simultaneously controls the depth of the tree and its statistical accuracy. We prove important properties of this objective and explore its connection to three well-known entropy-based decision tree objectives, i.e. Shannon entropy, Gini-entropy and its modified version, for which instead online optimization schemes were not yet developed. We show, via boosting-type guarantees, that maximizing the considered objective leads also to the reduction of all of these entropy-based objectives. The bounds we obtain critically depend on the strong-concavity properties of the entropy-based criteria, where the mildest dependence on the number of classes (only logarithmic) corresponds to the Shannon entropy."}
{"text": "  We present a method based on the orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix tri-factorization of the normalized Laplacian matrix for community detection in complex networks. While the exact factorization of a given order may not exist and is NP hard to compute, we obtain an approximate factorization by solving an optimization problem. We establish the connection of the factors obtained through the factorization to a non-negative basis of an invariant subspace of the estimated matrix, drawing parallel with the spectral clustering. Using such factorization for clustering in networks is motivated by analyzing a block-diagonal Laplacian matrix with the blocks representing the connected components of a graph. The method is shown to be consistent for community detection in graphs generated from the stochastic block model and the degree corrected stochastic block model. Simulation results and real data analysis show the effectiveness of these methods under a wide variety of situations, including sparse and highly heterogeneous graphs where the usual spectral clustering is known to fail. Our method also performs better than the state of the art in popular benchmark network datasets, e.g., the political web blogs and the karate club data."}
{"text": "  In this article, we propose CANDIES (Combined Approach for Novelty Detection in Intelligent Embedded Systems), a new approach to novelty detection in technical systems. We assume that in a technical system several processes interact. If we observe these processes with sensors, we are able to model the observations (samples) with a probabilistic model, where, in an ideal case, the components of the parametric mixture density model we use, correspond to the processes in the real world. Eventually, at run-time, novel processes emerge in the technical systems such as in the case of an unpredictable failure. As a consequence, new kinds of samples are observed that require an adaptation of the model. CANDIES relies on mixtures of Gaussians which can be used for classification purposes, too. New processes may emerge in regions of the models' input spaces where few samples were observed before (low-density regions) or in regions where already many samples were available (high-density regions). The latter case is more difficult, but most existing solutions focus on the former. Novelty detection in low- and high-density regions requires different detection strategies. With CANDIES, we introduce a new technique to detect novel processes in high-density regions by means of a fast online goodness-of-fit test. For detection in low-density regions we combine this approach with a 2SND (Two-Stage-Novelty-Detector) which we presented in preliminary work. The properties of CANDIES are evaluated using artificial data and benchmark data from the field of intrusion detection in computer networks, where the task is to detect new kinds of attacks."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of estimating the parameters of a regression model from a set of observations, each consisting of a response and a predictor. The response is assumed to be related to the predictor via a regression model of unknown parameters. Often, in such models the parameters to be estimated are assumed to be constant. Here we consider the more general scenario where the parameters are allowed to evolve over time, a more natural assumption for many applications. We model these dynamics via a linear update equation with additive noise that is often used in a wide range of engineering applications, particularly in the well-known and widely used Kalman filter (where the system state it seeks to estimate maps to the parameter values here). We derive an approximate algorithm to estimate both the mean and the variance of the parameter estimates in an online fashion for a generic regression model. This algorithm turns out to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter. We specialize our algorithm to the multivariate exponential family distribution to obtain a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM). Because the common regression models encountered in practice such as logistic, exponential and multinomial all have observations modeled through an exponential family distribution, our results are used to easily obtain algorithms for online mean and variance parameter estimation for all these regression models in the context of time-dependent parameters. Lastly, we propose to use these algorithms in the contextual multi-armed bandit scenario, where so far model parameters are assumed static and observations univariate and Gaussian or Bernoulli. Both of these restrictions can be relaxed using the algorithms described here, which we combine with Thompson sampling to show the resulting performance on a simulation."}
{"text": "  This paper studies graph-based active learning, where the goal is to reconstruct a binary signal defined on the nodes of a weighted graph, by sampling it on a small subset of the nodes. A new sampling algorithm is proposed, which sequentially selects the graph nodes to be sampled, based on an aggressive search for the boundary of the signal over the graph. The algorithm generalizes a recent method for sampling nodes in unweighted graphs. The generalization improves the sampling performance using the information gained from the available graph weights. An analysis of the number of samples required by the proposed algorithm is provided, and the gain over the unweighted method is further demonstrated in simulations. Additionally, the proposed method is compared with an alternative state of-the-art method, which is based on the graph's spectral properties. It is shown that the proposed method significantly outperforms the spectral sampling method, if the signal needs to be predicted with high accuracy. On the other hand, if a higher level of inaccuracy is tolerable, then the spectral method outperforms the proposed aggressive search method. Consequently, we propose a hybrid method, which is shown to combine the advantages of both approaches."}
{"text": "  With the rapid growth of crowdsourcing platforms it has become easy and relatively inexpensive to collect a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short time. However due to the lack of control over the quality of the annotators, some abnormal annotators may be affected by position bias which can potentially degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper we introduce a statistical framework to model and detect annotator's position bias in order to control the false discovery rate (FDR) without a prior knowledge on the amount of biased annotators - the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries being not too high, in order to assure that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. The key technical development relies on some new knockoff filters adapted to our problem and new algorithms based on the Inverse Scale Space dynamics whose discretization is potentially suitable for large scale crowdsourcing data analysis. Our studies are supported by experiments with both simulated examples and real-world data. The proposed framework provides us a useful tool for quantitatively studying annotator's abnormal behavior in crowdsourcing data arising from machine learning, sociology, computer vision, multimedia, etc."}
{"text": "  Sparse versions of principal component analysis (PCA) have imposed themselves as simple, yet powerful ways of selecting relevant features of high-dimensional data in an unsupervised manner. However, when several sparse principal components are computed, the interpretation of the selected variables is difficult since each axis has its own sparsity pattern and has to be interpreted separately. To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure called globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA) that allows to obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. This allows the practitioner to identify the original variables which are relevant to describe the data. To this end, using Roweis' probabilistic interpretation of PCA and a Gaussian prior on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact computation of the marginal likelihood of a Bayesian PCA model. To avoid the drawbacks of discrete model selection, a simple relaxation of this framework is presented. It allows to find a path of models using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood is then maximized over this path. This approach is illustrated on real and synthetic data sets. In particular, using unlabeled microarray data, GSPPCA infers much more relevant gene subsets than traditional sparse PCA algorithms."}
{"text": "  Despite recent breakthroughs in the applications of deep neural networks, one setting that presents a persistent challenge is that of \"one-shot learning.\" Traditional gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn, often through extensive iterative training. When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also introduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory location-based focusing mechanisms."}

{"text": "  In most practical problems of classifier learning, the training data suffers from the label noise. Hence, it is important to understand how robust is a learning algorithm to such label noise. This paper presents some theoretical analysis to show that many popular decision tree algorithms are robust to symmetric label noise under large sample size. We also present some sample complexity results which provide some bounds on the sample size for the robustness to hold with a high probability. Through extensive simulations we illustrate this robustness."}
{"text": "  We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. Popular methods rely on estimating a penalized maximum likelihood of the precision matrix. However, in these approaches structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term, the penalty can be difficult to adapt for domain-specific knowledge, and the inference is computationally demanding. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function, parametrized by a neural network that maps empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. Applying this framework, we find our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well: identifying relevant edges in both synthetic and real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain performance generally superior to analytical methods."}
{"text": "  Most contemporary multi-task learning methods assume linear models. This setting is considered shallow in the era of deep learning. In this paper, we present a new deep multi-task representation learning framework that learns cross-task sharing structure at every layer in a deep network. Our approach is based on generalising the matrix factorisation techniques explicitly or implicitly used by many conventional MTL algorithms to tensor factorisation, to realise automatic learning of end-to-end knowledge sharing in deep networks. This is in contrast to existing deep learning approaches that need a user-defined multi-task sharing strategy. Our approach applies to both homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our deep multi-task representation learning in terms of both higher accuracy and fewer design choices."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we bridge the gap between hyperparameter optimization and ensemble learning by performing Bayesian optimization of an ensemble with regards to its hyperparameters. Our method consists in building a fixed-size ensemble, optimizing the configuration of one classifier of the ensemble at each iteration of the hyperparameter optimization algorithm, taking into consideration the interaction with the other models when evaluating potential performances. We also consider the case where the ensemble is to be reconstructed at the end of the hyperparameter optimization phase, through a greedy selection over the pool of models generated during the optimization. We study the performance of our proposed method on three different hyperparameter spaces, showing that our approach is better than both the best single model and a greedy ensemble construction over the models produced by a standard Bayesian optimization."}
{"text": "  Modern distributed cyber-physical systems encounter a large variety of anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. In this regard, root-cause analysis becomes highly intractable due to complex fault propagation mechanisms in combination with diverse operating modes. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for root-cause analysis for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme for distributed cyber-physical systems built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among subsystems of a complex system. We present two approaches for root-cause analysis, namely the sequential state switching ($S^3$, based on free energy concept of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine, RBM) and artificial anomaly association ($A^3$, a multi-class classification framework using deep neural networks, DNN). Synthetic data from cases with failed pattern(s) and anomalous node are simulated to validate the proposed approaches, then compared with the performance of vector autoregressive (VAR) model-based root-cause analysis. Real dataset based on Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) is also used for validation. The results show that: (1) $S^3$ and $A^3$ approaches can obtain high accuracy in root-cause analysis and successfully handle multiple nominal operation modes, and (2) the proposed tool-chain is shown to be scalable while maintaining high accuracy."}
{"text": "  We consider online learning algorithms that guarantee worst-case regret rates in adversarial environments (so they can be deployed safely and will perform robustly), yet adapt optimally to favorable stochastic environments (so they will perform well in a variety of settings of practical importance). We quantify the friendliness of stochastic environments by means of the well-known Bernstein (a.k.a. generalized Tsybakov margin) condition. For two recent algorithms (Squint for the Hedge setting and MetaGrad for online convex optimization) we show that the particular form of their data-dependent individual-sequence regret guarantees implies that they adapt automatically to the Bernstein parameters of the stochastic environment. We prove that these algorithms attain fast rates in their respective settings both in expectation and with high probability."}
{"text": "  We consider regression under the \"extremely small $n$ large $p$\" condition, where the number of samples $n$ is so small compared to the dimensionality $p$ that predictors cannot be estimated without prior knowledge. This setup occurs in personalized medicine, for instance, when predicting treatment outcomes for an individual patient based on noisy high-dimensional genomics data. A remaining source of information is expert knowledge, which has received relatively little attention in recent years. We formulate the inference problem of asking expert feedback on features on a budget, propose an elicitation strategy for a simple \"small $n$\" setting, and derive conditions under which the elicitation strategy is optimal. Experiments on simulated experts, both on synthetic and genomics data, demonstrate that the proposed strategy can drastically improve prediction accuracy."}
{"text": "  Newton's method is a fundamental technique in optimization with quadratic convergence within a neighborhood around the optimum. However reaching this neighborhood is often slow and dominates the computational costs. We exploit two properties specific to empirical risk minimization problems to accelerate Newton's method, namely, subsampling training data and increasing strong convexity through regularization. We propose a novel continuation method, where we define a family of objectives over increasing sample sizes and with decreasing regularization strength. Solutions on this path are tracked such that the minimizer of the previous objective is guaranteed to be within the quadratic convergence region of the next objective to be optimized. Thereby every Newton iteration is guaranteed to achieve super-linear contractions with regard to the chosen objective, which becomes a moving target. We provide a theoretical analysis that motivates our algorithm, called DynaNewton, and characterizes its speed of convergence. Experiments on a wide range of data sets and problems consistently confirm the predicted computational savings."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose a new multi-armed bandit problem called the Gambler's Ruin Bandit Problem (GRBP). In the GRBP, the learner proceeds in a sequence of rounds, where each round is a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with two actions (arms): a continuation action that moves the learner randomly over the state space around the current state; and a terminal action that moves the learner directly into one of the two terminal states (goal and dead-end state). The current round ends when a terminal state is reached, and the learner incurs a positive reward only when the goal state is reached. The objective of the learner is to maximize its long-term reward (expected number of times the goal state is reached), without having any prior knowledge on the state transition probabilities. We first prove a result on the form of the optimal policy for the GRBP. Then, we define the regret of the learner with respect to an omnipotent oracle, which acts optimally in each round, and prove that it increases logarithmically over rounds. We also identify a condition under which the learner's regret is bounded. A potential application of the GRBP is optimal medical treatment assignment, in which the continuation action corresponds to a conservative treatment and the terminal action corresponds to a risky treatment such as surgery."}
{"text": "  Classification performance is often not uniform over the data. Some areas in the input space are easier to classify than others. Features that hold information about the \"difficulty\" of the data may be non-discriminative and are therefore disregarded in the classification process. We propose a meta-learning approach where performance may be improved by post-processing. This improvement is done by establishing a dynamic threshold on the base-classifier results. Since the base-classifier is treated as a \"black box\" the method presented can be used on any state of the art classifier in order to try an improve its performance. We focus our attention on how to better control the true-positive/false-positive trade-off known as the ROC curve. We propose an algorithm for the derivation of optimal thresholds by redistributing the error depending on features that hold information about difficulty. We demonstrate the resulting benefit on both synthetic and real-life data."}
{"text": "  Transfer learning is a problem defined over two domains. These two domains share the same feature space and class label space, but have significantly different distributions. One domain has sufficient labels, named as source domain, and the other domain has few labels, named as target do- main. The problem is to learn a effective classifier for the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for this problem by learning a partially shared classifier for the target domain, and weighting the source domain data points. We learn some shared subspaces for both the data points of the two domains, and a shared classifier in the shared subspaces. We hope that in the shared subspaces, the distributions of two domain can match each other well, and to match the distributions, we weight the source domain data points with different weighting factors. Moreover, we adapt the shared classifier to each domain by learning different adaptation functions. To learn the subspace transformation matrices, the classifier parameters, and the adaptation parameters, we build a objective function with weighted clas- sification errors, parameter regularization, local reconstruction regularization, and distribution matching. This objective function is minimized by an itera- tive algorithm. Experiments show its effectiveness over benchmark data sets, including travel destination review data set, face expression data set, spam email data set, etc."}
{"text": "  Most of the semi-supervised classification methods developed so far use unlabeled data for regularization purposes under particular distributional assumptions such as the cluster assumption. In contrast, recently developed methods of classification from positive and unlabeled data (PU classification) use unlabeled data for risk evaluation, i.e., label information is directly extracted from unlabeled data. In this paper, we extend PU classification to also incorporate negative data and propose a novel semi-supervised classification approach. We establish generalization error bounds for our novel methods and show that the bounds decrease with respect to the number of unlabeled data without the distributional assumptions that are required in existing semi-supervised classification methods. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods."}
{"text": "  Kernel-based quadrature rules are becoming important in machine learning and statistics, as they achieve super-$\\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates in numerical integration, and thus provide alternatives to Monte Carlo integration in challenging settings where integrands are expensive to evaluate or where integrands are high dimensional. These rules are based on the assumption that the integrand has a certain degree of smoothness, which is expressed as that the integrand belongs to a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, this assumption can be violated in practice (e.g., when the integrand is a black box function), and no general theory has been established for the convergence of kernel quadratures in such misspecified settings. Our contribution is in proving that kernel quadratures can be consistent even when the integrand does not belong to the assumed RKHS, i.e., when the integrand is less smooth than assumed. Specifically, we derive convergence rates that depend on the (unknown) lesser smoothness of the integrand, where the degree of smoothness is expressed via powers of RKHSs or via Sobolev spaces."}
{"text": "  In many applications, it is desirable to extract only the relevant aspects of data. A principled way to do this is the information bottleneck (IB) method, where one seeks a code that maximizes information about a 'relevance' variable, Y, while constraining the information encoded about the original data, X. Unfortunately however, the IB method is computationally demanding when data are high-dimensional and/or non-gaussian. Here we propose an approximate variational scheme for maximizing a lower bound on the IB objective, analogous to variational EM. Using this method, we derive an IB algorithm to recover features that are both relevant and sparse. Finally, we demonstrate how kernelized versions of the algorithm can be used to address a broad range of problems with non-linear relation between X and Y."}
{"text": "  The Electromyography (EMG) signal is the electrical activity produced by cells of skeletal muscles in order to provide a movement. The non-invasive prosthetic hand works with several electrodes, placed on the stump of an amputee, that record this signal. In order to favour the control of prosthesis, the EMG signal is analyzed with algorithms based on machine learning theory to decide the movement that the subject is going to do. In order to obtain a significant control of the prosthesis and avoid mismatch between desired and performed movements, a long training period is needed when we use the traditional algorithm of machine learning (i.e. Support Vector Machines). An actual challenge in this field concerns the reduction of the time necessary for an amputee to learn how to use the prosthesis. Recently, several algorithms that exploit a form of prior knowledge have been proposed. In general, we refer to prior knowledge as a past experience available in the form of models. In our case an amputee, that attempts to perform some movements with the prosthesis, could use experience from different subjects that are already able to perform those movements. The aim of this work is to verify, with a computational investigation, if for an amputee this kind of previous experience is useful in order to reduce the training time and boost the prosthetic control. Furthermore, we want to understand if and how the final results change when the previous knowledge of intact or amputated subjects is used for a new amputee. Our experiments indicate that: (1) the use of experience, from other subjects already trained to perform a task, makes us able to reduce the training time of about an order of magnitude; (2) it seems that an amputee that tries to learn to use the prosthesis doesn't reach different results when he/she exploits previous experience of amputees or intact."}
{"text": "  We extend the traditional worst-case, minimax analysis of stochastic convex optimization by introducing a localized form of minimax complexity for individual functions. Our main result gives function-specific lower and upper bounds on the number of stochastic subgradient evaluations needed to optimize either the function or its \"hardest local alternative\" to a given numerical precision. The bounds are expressed in terms of a localized and computational analogue of the modulus of continuity that is central to statistical minimax analysis. We show how the computational modulus of continuity can be explicitly calculated in concrete cases, and relates to the curvature of the function at the optimum. We also prove a superefficiency result that demonstrates it is a meaningful benchmark, acting as a computational analogue of the Fisher information in statistical estimation. The nature and practical implications of the results are demonstrated in simulations."}
{"text": "  We present a new framework of applying deep neural networks (DNN) to devise a universal discrete denoiser. Unlike other approaches that utilize supervised learning for denoising, we do not require any additional training data. In such setting, while the ground-truth label, i.e., the clean data, is not available, we devise \"pseudo-labels\" and a novel objective function such that DNN can be trained in a same way as supervised learning to become a discrete denoiser. We experimentally show that our resulting algorithm, dubbed as Neural DUDE, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in several applications with a systematic rule of choosing the hyperparameter, which is an attractive feature in practice."}
{"text": "  In many real-world applications data exhibits non-stationarity, i.e., its distribution changes over time. One approach to handling non-stationarity is to remove or minimize it before attempting to analyze the data. In the context of brain computer interface (BCI) data analysis this may be done by means of stationary subspace analysis (SSA). The classic SSA method finds a matrix that projects the data onto a stationary subspace by optimizing a cost function based on a matrix divergence. In this work we present an alternative method for SSA based on a symmetrized version of this matrix divergence. We show that this frames the problem in terms of distances between symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, suggesting a geometric interpretation of the problem. Stemming from this geometric viewpoint, we introduce and analyze a method which utilizes the geometry of the SPD matrix manifold and the invariance properties of its metrics. Most notably we show that these invariances alleviate the need to whiten the input matrices, a common step in many SSA methods which often introduces errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique in experiments on both synthesized and real-world data."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we derive a modified InfoMax algorithm for the solution of Blind Signal Separation (BSS) problems by using advanced stochastic methods. The proposed approach is based on a novel stochastic optimization approach known as the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm. The proposed BSS solution can benefit from the excellent properties of the Adam approach. In order to derive the new learning rule, the Adam algorithm is introduced in the derivation of the cost function maximization in the standard InfoMax algorithm. The natural gradient adaptation is also considered. Finally, some experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Dictionary learning is a cutting-edge area in imaging processing, that has recently led to state-of-the-art results in many signal processing tasks. The idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a learned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis. Determining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for both precision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionary learning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novel regularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method can simultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionary size. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with the non-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples are presented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"text": "  The hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a specified kernel are often estimated from the data via the maximum marginal likelihood. Due to the non-convexity of marginal likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters, the optimization may not converge to the global maxima. A common approach to tackle this issue is to use multiple starting points randomly selected from a specific prior distribution. As a result the choice of prior distribution may play a vital role in the predictability of this approach. However, there exists little research in the literature to study the impact of the prior distributions on the hyperparameter estimation and the performance of GPR. In this paper, we provide the first empirical study on this problem using simulated and real data experiments. We consider different types of priors for the initial values of hyperparameters for some commonly used kernels and investigate the influence of the priors on the predictability of GPR models. The results reveal that, once a kernel is chosen, different priors for the initial hyperparameters have no significant impact on the performance of GPR prediction, despite that the estimates of the hyperparameters are very different to the true values in some cases."}
{"text": "  In a traditional setting, classifiers are trained to approximate a target function $f:X \\rightarrow Y$ where at least a sample for each $y \\in Y$ is presented to the training algorithm. In a zero-shot setting we have a subset of the labels $\\hat{Y} \\subset Y$ for which we do not observe any corresponding training instance. Still, the function $f$ that we train must be able to correctly assign labels also on $\\hat{Y}$. In practice, zero-shot problems are very important especially when the label set is large and the cost of editorially label samples for all possible values in the label set might be prohibitively high. Most recent approaches to zero-shot learning are based on finding and exploiting relationships between labels using semantic embeddings. We show in this paper that semantic embeddings, despite being very good at capturing relationships between labels, are not very good at capturing the relationships among labels in a data-dependent manner. For this reason, we propose a novel two-step process for learning a zero-shot classifier. In the first step, we learn what we call a \\emph{property embedding space} capturing the \"\\emph{learnable}\" features of the label set. Then, we exploit the learned properties in order to reduce the generalization error for a linear nearest neighbor-based classifier."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of robustifying high-dimensional structured estimation. Robust techniques are key in real-world applications which often involve outliers and data corruption. We focus on trimmed versions of structurally regularized M-estimators in the high-dimensional setting, including the popular Least Trimmed Squares estimator, as well as analogous estimators for generalized linear models and graphical models, using possibly non-convex loss functions. We present a general analysis of their statistical convergence rates and consistency, and then take a closer look at the trimmed versions of the Lasso and Graphical Lasso estimators as special cases. On the optimization side, we show how to extend algorithms for M-estimators to fit trimmed variants and provide guarantees on their numerical convergence. The generality and competitive performance of high-dimensional trimmed estimators are illustrated numerically on both simulated and real-world genomics data."}
{"text": "  We propose a data-driven, coarse-graining formulation in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast to existing techniques which are based on a fine-to-coarse map, we adopt the opposite strategy by prescribing a probabilistic coarse-to-fine map. This corresponds to a directed probabilistic model where the coarse variables play the role of latent generators of the fine scale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the framework proposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy method and is capable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place during the CG process. Furthermore, it can be readily extended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are reflected in the posterior of the model parameters. The latter can be used to produce not only point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions or macroscopic observables, but more importantly, predictive posterior distributions on these quantities. Predictive posterior distributions reflect the confidence of the model as a function of the amount of data and the level of coarse-graining. The issues of model complexity and model selection are seamlessly addressed by employing a hierarchical prior that favors the discovery of sparse solutions, revealing the most prominent features in the coarse-grained model. A flexible and parallelizable Monte Carlo - Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) scheme is proposed for carrying out inference and learning tasks. A comparative assessment of the proposed methodology is presented for a lattice spin system and the SPC/E water model."}
{"text": "  The best arm identification problem (BEST-1-ARM) is the most basic pure exploration problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits. The problem has a long history and attracted significant attention for the last decade. However, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the optimal sample complexity of the problem: The state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity of $O(\\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\Delta_{i}^{-2}(\\ln\\delta^{-1} + \\ln\\ln\\Delta_i^{-1}))$ ($\\Delta_{i}$ is the difference between the largest mean and the $i^{th}$ mean), while the best known lower bound is $\\Omega(\\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\Delta_{i}^{-2}\\ln\\delta^{-1})$ for general instances and $\\Omega(\\Delta^{-2} \\ln\\ln \\Delta^{-1})$ for the two-arm instances. We propose to study the instance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem. Previous work has proved that it is impossible to have an instance optimal algorithm for the 2-arm problem. However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term $\\Omega(\\Delta_2^{-2} \\ln\\ln \\Delta_2^{-1})$ (which is an upper bound and worst case lower bound for the 2-arm problem), there is an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM. Moreover, we introduce a new quantity, called the gap entropy for a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture that it is the instance-wise lower bound. Hence, resolving this conjecture would provide a final answer to the old and basic problem."}
{"text": "  This paper extends the idea of Universum learning [18, 19] to regression problems. We propose new Universum-SVM formulation for regression problems that incorporates a priori knowledge in the form of additional data samples. These additional data samples or Universum belong to the same application domain as the training samples, but they follow a different distribution. Several empirical comparisons are presented to illustrate the utility of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  We present an algorithm that achieves almost optimal pseudo-regret bounds against adversarial and stochastic bandits. Against adversarial bandits the pseudo-regret is $O(K\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ and against stochastic bandits the pseudo-regret is $O(\\sum_i (\\log n)/\\Delta_i)$. We also show that no algorithm with $O(\\log n)$ pseudo-regret against stochastic bandits can achieve $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ expected regret against adaptive adversarial bandits. This complements previous results of Bubeck and Slivkins (2012) that show $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ expected adversarial regret with $O((\\log n)^2)$ stochastic pseudo-regret."}
{"text": "  We study dueling bandits with weak utility-based regret when preferences over arms have a total order and carry observable feature vectors. The order is assumed to be determined by these feature vectors, an unknown preference vector, and a known utility function. This structure introduces dependence between preferences for pairs of arms, and allows learning about the preference over one pair of arms from the preference over another pair of arms. We propose an algorithm for this setting called Comparing The Best (CTB), which we show has constant expected cumulative weak utility-based regret. We provide a Bayesian interpretation for CTB, an implementation appropriate for a small number of arms, and an alternate implementation for many arms that can be used when the input parameters satisfy a decomposability condition. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that CTB with appropriate input parameters outperforms all benchmarks considered."}
{"text": "  The primal-dual distributed optimization methods have broad large-scale machine learning applications. Previous primal-dual distributed methods are not applicable when the dual formulation is not available, e.g. the sum-of-non-convex objectives. Moreover, these algorithms and theoretical analysis are based on the fundamental assumption that the computing speeds of multiple machines in a cluster are similar. However, the straggler problem is an unavoidable practical issue in the distributed system because of the existence of slow machines. Therefore, the total computational time of the distributed optimization methods is highly dependent on the slowest machine. In this paper, we address these two issues by proposing distributed asynchronous dual free stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm for distributed optimization. Our method does not need the dual formulation of the target problem in the optimization. We tackle the straggler problem through asynchronous communication and the negative effect of slow machines is significantly alleviated. We also analyze the convergence rate of our method and prove the linear convergence rate even if the individual functions in objective are non-convex. Experiments on both convex and non-convex loss functions are used to validate our statements."}
{"text": "  In many real tasks the features are evolving, with some features being vanished and some other features augmented. For example, in environment monitoring some sensors expired whereas some new ones deployed; in mobile game recommendation some games dropped whereas some new ones added. Learning with such incremental and decremental features is crucial but rarely studied, particularly when the data coming like a stream and thus it is infeasible to keep the whole data for optimization. In this paper, we study this challenging problem and present the OPID approach. Our approach attempts to compress important information of vanished features into functions of survived features, and then expand to include the augmented features. It is the one-pass learning approach, which only needs to scan each instance once and does not need to store the whole data, and thus satisfy the evolving streaming data nature. The effectiveness of our approach is validated theoretically and empirically."}
{"text": "  We present a Bayesian sequential decision-making formulation of the information filtering problem, in which an algorithm presents items (news articles, scientific papers, tweets) arriving in a stream, and learns relevance from user feedback on presented items. We model user preferences using a Bayesian linear model, similar in spirit to a Bayesian linear bandit. We compute a computational upper bound on the value of the optimal policy, which allows computing an optimality gap for implementable policies. We then use this analysis as motivation in introducing a pair of new Decompose-Then-Decide (DTD) heuristic policies, DTD-Dynamic-Programming (DTD-DP) and DTD-Upper-Confidence-Bound (DTD-UCB). We compare DTD-DP and DTD-UCB against several benchmarks on real and simulated data, demonstrating significant improvement, and show that the achieved performance is close to the upper bound."}
{"text": "  This paper investigates an important problem in stream mining, i.e., classification under streaming emerging new classes or SENC. The common approach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either a supervised learner or a semi-supervised learner. We propose an alternative approach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem. The SENC problem can be decomposed into three sub problems: detecting emerging new classes, classifying for known classes, and updating models to enable classification of instances of the new class and detection of more emerging new classes. The proposed method employs completely random trees which have been shown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning independently in the literature. This is the first time, as far as we know, that completely random trees are used as a single common core to solve all three sub problems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning and model update in data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method often achieves significantly better outcomes than existing classification-focused methods."}

We also introduce Kerlym, an open Keras based reinforcement learning agent collection for OpenAI's Gym."}
{"text": "  A fall is an abnormal activity that occurs rarely; however, missing to identify falls can have serious health and safety implications on an individual. Due to the rarity of occurrence of falls, there may be insufficient or no training data available for them. Therefore, standard supervised machine learning methods may not be directly applied to handle this problem. In this paper, we present a taxonomy for the study of fall detection from the perspective of availability of fall data. The proposed taxonomy is independent of the type of sensors used and specific feature extraction/selection methods. The taxonomy identifies different categories of classification methods for the study of fall detection based on the availability of their data during training the classifiers. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review within those categories and identify the approach of treating a fall as an abnormal activity to be a plausible research direction. We conclude our paper by discussing several open research problems in the field and pointers for future research."}
{"text": "  Auto-encoders are often used as building blocks of deep network classifier to learn feature extractors, but task-irrelevant information in the input data may lead to bad extractors and result in poor generalization performance of the network. In this paper,via dropping the task-irrelevant input variables the performance of auto-encoders can be obviously improved .Specifically, an importance-based variable selection method is proposed to aim at finding the task-irrelevant input variables and dropping them.It firstly estimates importance of each variable,and then drops the variables with importance value lower than a threshold. In order to obtain better performance, the method can be employed for each layer of stacked auto-encoders. Experimental results show that when combined with our method the stacked denoising auto-encoders achieves significantly improved performance on three challenging datasets."}
{"text": "  Generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) aims at finding latent low-dimensional common structure from multiple views (feature vectors in different domains) of the same entities. Unlike principal component analysis (PCA) that handles a single view, (G)CCA is able to integrate information from different feature spaces. Here we focus on MAX-VAR GCCA, a popular formulation which has recently gained renewed interest in multilingual processing and speech modeling. The classic MAX-VAR GCCA problem can be solved optimally via eigen-decomposition of a matrix that compounds the (whitened) correlation matrices of the views; but this solution has serious scalability issues, and is not directly amenable to incorporating pertinent structural constraints such as non-negativity and sparsity on the canonical components. We posit regularized MAX-VAR GCCA as a non-convex optimization problem and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to handle it. Our algorithm alternates between {\\em inexact} solutions of a regularized least squares subproblem and a manifold-constrained non-convex subproblem, thereby achieving substantial memory and computational savings. An important benefit of our design is that it can easily handle structure-promoting regularization. We show that the algorithm globally converges to a critical point at a sublinear rate, and approaches a global optimal solution at a linear rate when no regularization is considered. Judiciously designed simulations and large-scale word embedding tasks are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Stochastic variational inference (SVI), the state-of-the-art algorithm for scaling variational inference to large-datasets, is inherently serial. Moreover, it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single processor; this is problematic when the number of parameters is in billions. In this paper, we propose extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), an asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference for mixture models on massive real world datasets. ESVI overcomes the limitations of SVI by requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a subset of the parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESVI by running Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on UMBC-3B, a dataset that has a vocabulary of 3 million and a token size of 3 billion. In our experiments, we found that ESVI not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time, but also achieves a better quality solution. In addition, we propose a strategy to speed up computation and save memory when fitting large number of topics."}
{"text": "  Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images for diagnosis of a clinical condition. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total Variation (TV) enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties but reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed towards any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: To propose an expression of the duality gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the convergence speed. We provide a convergence rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision."}
{"text": "  Imaging genetic research has essentially focused on discovering unique and co-association effects, but typically ignoring to identify outliers or atypical objects in genetic as well as non-genetics variables. Identifying significant outliers is an essential and challenging issue for imaging genetics and multiple sources data analysis. Therefore, we need to examine for transcription errors of identified outliers. First, we address the influence function (IF) of kernel mean element, kernel covariance operator, kernel cross-covariance operator, kernel canonical correlation analysis (kernel CCA) and multiple kernel CCA. Second, we propose an IF of multiple kernel CCA, which can be applied for more than two datasets. Third, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations of multiple sources of data based on the IF of kernel CCA and multiple kernel CCA. Finally, the proposed methods are capable of analyzing outliers of subjects usually found in biomedical applications, in which the number of dimension is large. To examine the outliers, we use the stem-and-leaf display. Experiments on both synthesized and imaging genetics data (e.g., SNP, fMRI, and DNA methylation) demonstrate that the proposed visualization can be applied effectively."}
{"text": "  In genome-wide interaction studies, to detect gene-gene interactions, most methods are divided into two folds: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based and gene-based methods. Basically, the methods based on the gene are more effective than the methods based on a single SNP. Recent years, while the kernel canonical correlation analysis (Classical kernel CCA) based U statistic (KCCU) has proposed to detect the nonlinear relationship between genes. To estimate the variance in KCCU, they have used resampling based methods which are highly computationally intensive. In addition, classical kernel CCA is not robust to contaminated data. We, therefore, first discuss robust kernel mean element, the robust kernel covariance, and cross-covariance operators. Second, we propose a method based on influence function to estimate the variance of the KCCU. Third, we propose a nonparametric robust KCCU method based on robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. Finally, we investigate the proposed methods to synthesized data and imaging genetic data set. Based on gene ontology and pathway analysis, the synthesized and genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed robust method shows the superior performance of the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  Zero Shot Learning (ZSL) enables a learning model to classify instances of an unseen class during training. While most research in ZSL focuses on single-label classification, few studies have been done in multi-label ZSL, where an instance is associated with a set of labels simultaneously, due to the difficulty in modeling complex semantics conveyed by a set of labels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multi-label ZSL via concept embedding learned from collections of public users' annotations of multimedia. Thanks to concept embedding, multi-label ZSL can be done by efficiently mapping an instance input features onto the concept embedding space in a similar manner used in single-label ZSL. Moreover, our semantic learning model is capable of embedding an out-of-vocabulary label by inferring its meaning from its co-occurring labels. Thus, our approach allows both seen and unseen labels during the concept embedding learning to be used in the aforementioned instance mapping, which makes multi-label ZSL more flexible and suitable for real applications. Experimental results of multi-label ZSL on images and music tracks suggest that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art multi-label ZSL model and can deal with a scenario involving out-of-vocabulary labels without re-training the semantics learning model."}
{"text": "  We give an oracle-based algorithm for the adversarial contextual bandit problem, where either contexts are drawn i.i.d. or the sequence of contexts is known a priori, but where the losses are picked adversarially. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, assuming access to an offline optimization oracle, and enjoys a regret of order $O((KT)^{\\frac{2}{3}}(\\log N)^{\\frac{1}{3}})$, where $K$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of baseline policies. Our result is the first to break the $O(T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ barrier that is achieved by recently introduced algorithms. Breaking this barrier was left as a major open problem. Our analysis is based on the recent relaxation based approach of (Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2016)."}
{"text": "  We present a novel k-way high-dimensional graphical model called the Generalized Root Model (GRM) that explicitly models dependencies between variable sets of size k > 2---where k = 2 is the standard pairwise graphical model. This model is based on taking the k-th root of the original sufficient statistics of any univariate exponential family with positive sufficient statistics, including the Poisson and exponential distributions. As in the recent work with square root graphical (SQR) models [Inouye et al. 2016]---which was restricted to pairwise dependencies---we give the conditions of the parameters that are needed for normalization using the radial conditionals similar to the pairwise case [Inouye et al. 2016]. In particular, we show that the Poisson GRM has no restrictions on the parameters and the exponential GRM only has a restriction akin to negative definiteness. We develop a simple but general learning algorithm based on L1-regularized node-wise regressions. We also present a general way of numerically approximating the log partition function and associated derivatives of the GRM univariate node conditionals---in contrast to [Inouye et al. 2016], which only provided algorithm for estimating the exponential SQR. To illustrate GRM, we model word counts with a Poisson GRM and show the associated k-sized variable sets. We finish by discussing methods for reducing the parameter space in various situations."}
{"text": "  We propose a nonconvex estimator for joint multivariate regression and precision matrix estimation in the high dimensional regime, under sparsity constraints. A gradient descent algorithm with hard thresholding is developed to solve the nonconvex estimator, and it attains a linear rate of convergence to the true regression coefficients and precision matrix simultaneously, up to the statistical error. Compared with existing methods along this line of research, which have little theoretical guarantee, the proposed algorithm not only is computationally much more efficient with provable convergence guarantee, but also attains the optimal finite sample statistical rate up to a logarithmic factor. Thorough experiments on both synthetic and real datasets back up our theory."}
{"text": "  Quantification is the machine learning task of estimating test-data class proportions that are not necessarily similar to those in training. Apart from its intrinsic value as an aggregate statistic, quantification output can also be used to optimize classifier probabilities, thereby increasing classification accuracy. We unify major quantification approaches under a constrained multi-variate regression framework, and use mathematical programming to estimate class proportions for different loss functions. With this modeling approach, we extend existing binary-only quantification approaches to multi-class settings as well. We empirically verify our unified framework by experimenting with several multi-class datasets including the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and CIFAR-10."}
{"text": "  We introduce the truncated Gaussian graphical model (TGGM) as a novel framework for designing statistical models for nonlinear learning. A TGGM is a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) with a subset of variables truncated to be nonnegative. The truncated variables are assumed latent and integrated out to induce a marginal model. We show that the variables in the marginal model are non-Gaussian distributed and their expected relations are nonlinear. We use expectation-maximization to break the inference of the nonlinear model into a sequence of TGGM inference problems, each of which is efficiently solved by using the properties and numerical methods of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We use the TGGM to design models for nonlinear regression and classification, with the performances of these models demonstrated on extensive benchmark datasets and compared to state-of-the-art competing results."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of smooth imitation learning for online sequence prediction, where the goal is to train a policy that can smoothly imitate demonstrated behavior in a dynamic and continuous environment in response to online, sequential context input. Since the mapping from context to behavior is often complex, we take a learning reduction approach to reduce smooth imitation learning to a regression problem using complex function classes that are regularized to ensure smoothness. We present a learning meta-algorithm that achieves fast and stable convergence to a good policy. Our approach enjoys several attractive properties, including being fully deterministic, employing an adaptive learning rate that can provably yield larger policy improvements compared to previous approaches, and the ability to ensure stable convergence. Our empirical results demonstrate significant performance gains over previous approaches."}
{"text": "  Infant-directed speech (IDS) has distinctive properties that differ from adult-directed speech (ADS). Why it has these properties -- and whether they are intended to facilitate language learning -- is matter of contention. We argue that much of this disagreement stems from lack of a formal, guiding theory of how phonetic categories should best be taught to infant-like learners. In the absence of such a theory, researchers have relied on intuitions about learning to guide the argument. We use a formal theory of teaching, validated through experiments in other domains, as the basis for a detailed analysis of whether IDS is well-designed for teaching phonetic categories. Using the theory, we generate ideal data for teaching phonetic categories in English. We qualitatively compare the simulated teaching data with human IDS, finding that the teaching data exhibit many features of IDS, including some that have been taken as evidence IDS is not for teaching. The simulated data reveal potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the role of IDS in language learning. Focusing on different formants and phoneme sets leads to different conclusions, and the benefit of the teaching data to learners is not apparent until a sufficient number of examples have been provided. Finally, we investigate transfer of IDS to learning ADS. The teaching data improves classification of ADS data, but only for the learner they were generated to teach; not universally across all classes of learner. This research offers a theoretically-grounded framework that empowers experimentalists to systematically evaluate whether IDS is for teaching."}
{"text": "  We study a general version of the adversarial online learning problem. We are given a decision set $\\mathcal{X}$ in a reflexive Banach space $X$ and a sequence of reward vectors in the dual space of $X$. At each iteration, we choose an action from $\\mathcal{X}$, based on the observed sequence of previous rewards. Our goal is to minimize regret, defined as the gap between the realized reward and the reward of the best fixed action in hindsight. Using results from infinite dimensional convex analysis, we generalize the method of Dual Averaging (or Follow the Regularized Leader) to our setting and obtain general upper bounds on the worst-case regret that subsume a wide range of results from the literature. Under the assumption of uniformly continuous rewards, we obtain explicit anytime regret bounds in a setting where the decision set is the set of probability distributions on a compact metric space $S$ whose Radon-Nikodym derivatives are elements of $L^p(S)$ for some $p > 1$. Importantly, we make no convexity assumptions on either the set $S$ or the reward functions. We also prove a general lower bound on the worst-case regret for any online algorithm. We then apply these results to the problem of learning in repeated continuous two-player zero-sum games, in which players' strategy sets are compact metric spaces. In doing so, we first prove that if both players play a Hannan-consistent strategy, then with probability 1 the empirical distributions of play weakly converge to the set of Nash equilibria of the game. We then show that, under mild assumptions, Dual Averaging on the (infinite-dimensional) space of probability distributions indeed achieves Hannan-consistency. Finally, we illustrate our results through numerical examples."}
{"text": "  Rapid overlay of chemical structures (ROCS) is a standard tool for the calculation of 3D shape and chemical (\"color\") similarity. ROCS uses unweighted sums to combine many aspects of similarity, yielding parameter-free models for virtual screening. In this report, we decompose the ROCS color force field into \"color components\" and \"color atom overlaps\", novel color similarity features that can be weighted in a system-specific manner by machine learning algorithms. In cross-validation experiments, these additional features significantly improve virtual screening performance (ROC AUC scores) relative to standard ROCS."}
{"text": "  Clustering is one of the most important unsupervised problems in machine learning and statistics. Among many existing algorithms, kernel k-means has drawn much research attention due to its ability to find non-linear cluster boundaries and its inherent simplicity. There are two main approaches for kernel k-means: SVD of the kernel matrix and convex relaxations. Despite the attention kernel clustering has received both from theoretical and applied quarters, not much is known about robustness of the methods. In this paper we first introduce a semidefinite programming relaxation for the kernel clustering problem, then prove that under a suitable model specification, both the K-SVD and SDP approaches are consistent in the limit, albeit SDP is strongly consistent, i.e. achieves exact recovery, whereas K-SVD is weakly consistent, i.e. the fraction of misclassified nodes vanish."}
{"text": "  Monte Carlo (MC) sampling algorithms are an extremely widely-used technique to estimate expectations of functions f(x), especially in high dimensions. Control variates are a very powerful technique to reduce the error of such estimates, but in their conventional form rely on having an accurate approximation of f, a priori. Stacked Monte Carlo (StackMC) is a recently introduced technique designed to overcome this limitation by fitting a control variate to the data samples themselves. Done naively, forming a control variate to the data would result in overfitting, typically worsening the MC algorithm's performance. StackMC uses in-sample / out-sample techniques to remove this overfitting. Crucially, it is a post-processing technique, requiring no additional samples, and can be applied to data generated by any MC estimator. Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that StackMC improved the estimates of expectations when it was used to post-process samples produces by a \"simple sampling\" MC estimator. Here we substantially extend this earlier work. We provide an in-depth analysis of the StackMC algorithm, which we use to construct an improved version of the original algorithm, with lower estimation error. We then perform experiments of StackMC on several additional kinds of MC estimators, demonstrating improved performance when the samples are generated via importance sampling, Latin-hypercube sampling and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. We also show how to extend StackMC to combine multiple fitting functions, and how to apply it to discrete input spaces x."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel semi-supervised structured output prediction method based on local linear regression in this paper. The existing semi-supervise structured output prediction methods learn a global predictor for all the data points in a data set, which ignores the differences of local distributions of the data set, and the effects to the structured output prediction. To solve this problem, we propose to learn the missing structured outputs and local predictors for neighborhoods of different data points jointly. Using the local linear regression strategy, in the neighborhood of each data point, we propose to learn a local linear predictor by minimizing both the complexity of the predictor and the upper bound of the structured prediction loss. The minimization problem is solved by sub-gradient descent algorithms. We conduct experiments over two benchmark data sets, and the results show the advantages of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  The vast majority of the neural network literature focuses on predicting point values for a given set of response variables, conditioned on a feature vector. In many cases we need to model the full joint conditional distribution over the response variables rather than simply making point predictions. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to such conditional density estimation (CDE): Multiscale Nets (MSNs) and CDE Trend Filtering. Multiscale nets transform the CDE regression task into a hierarchical classification task by decomposing the density into a series of half-spaces and learning boolean probabilities of each split. CDE Trend Filtering applies a k-th order graph trend filtering penalty to the unnormalized logits of a multinomial classifier network, with each edge in the graph corresponding to a neighboring point on a discretized version of the density. We compare both methods against plain multinomial classifier networks and mixture density networks (MDNs) on a simulated dataset and three real-world datasets. The results suggest the two methods are complementary: MSNs work well in a high-data-per-feature regime and CDE-TF is well suited for few-samples-per-feature scenarios where overfitting is a primary concern."}
{"text": "  The multivariate normal density is a monotonic function of the distance to the mean, and its ellipsoidal shape is due to the underlying Euclidean metric. We suggest to replace this metric with a locally adaptive, smoothly changing (Riemannian) metric that favors regions of high local density. The resulting locally adaptive normal distribution (LAND) is a generalization of the normal distribution to the \"manifold\" setting, where data is assumed to lie near a potentially low-dimensional manifold embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^D$. The LAND is parametric, depending only on a mean and a covariance, and is the maximum entropy distribution under the given metric. The underlying metric is, however, non-parametric. We develop a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer the distribution parameters that relies on a combination of gradient descent and Monte Carlo integration. We further extend the LAND to mixture models, and provide the corresponding EM algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of the LAND to fit non-trivial probability distributions over both synthetic data, and EEG measurements of human sleep."}
{"text": "  The k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) method has received much attention in the past decades, where some theoretical bounds on its performance were identified and where practical optimizations were proposed for making it work fairly well in high dimensional spaces and on large datasets. From countless experiments of the past it became widely accepted that the value of k has a significant impact on the performance of this method. However, the efficient optimization of this parameter has not received so much attention in literature. Today, the most common approach is to cross-validate or bootstrap this value for all values in question. This approach forces distances to be recomputed many times, even if efficient methods are used. Hence, estimating the optimal k can become expensive even on modern systems. Frequently, this circumstance leads to a sparse manual search of k. In this paper we want to point out that a systematic and thorough estimation of the parameter k can be performed efficiently. The discussed approach relies on large matrices, but we want to argue, that in practice a higher space complexity is often much less of a problem than repetitive distance computations."}
{"text": "  Unsupervised learning aims at the discovery of hidden structure that drives the observations in the real world. It is essential for success in modern machine learning. Latent variable models are versatile in unsupervised learning and have applications in almost every domain. Training latent variable models is challenging due to the non-convexity of the likelihood objective. An alternative method is based on the spectral decomposition of low order moment tensors. This versatile framework is guaranteed to estimate the correct model consistently. My thesis spans both theoretical analysis of tensor decomposition framework and practical implementation of various applications. This thesis presents theoretical results on convergence to globally optimal solution of tensor decomposition using the stochastic gradient descent, despite non-convexity of the objective. This is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees for the stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. This thesis also presents large-scale deployment of spectral methods carried out on various platforms. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as random projection are incorporated for a highly parallel and scalable tensor decomposition algorithm. We obtain a gain in both accuracies and in running times by several orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-art variational methods. To solve real world problems, more advanced models and learning algorithms are proposed. This thesis discusses generalization of LDA model to mixed membership stochastic block model for learning user communities in social network, convolutional dictionary model for learning word-sequence embeddings, hierarchical tensor decomposition and latent tree structure model for learning disease hierarchy, and spatial point process mixture model for detecting cell types in neuroscience."}
{"text": "  Finding overcomplete latent representations of data has applications in data analysis, signal processing, machine learning, theoretical neuroscience and many other fields. In an overcomplete representation, the number of latent features exceeds the data dimensionality, which is useful when the data is undersampled by the measurements (compressed sensing, information bottlenecks in neural systems) or composed from multiple complete sets of linear features, each spanning the data space. Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is a linear technique for learning sparse latent representations, which typically has a lower computational cost than sparse coding, its nonlinear, recurrent counterpart. While well suited for finding complete representations, we show that overcompleteness poses a challenge to existing ICA algorithms. Specifically, the coherence control in existing ICA algorithms, necessary to prevent the formation of duplicate dictionary features, is ill-suited in the overcomplete case. We show that in this case several existing ICA algorithms have undesirable global minima that maximize coherence. Further, by comparing ICA algorithms on synthetic data and natural images to the computationally more expensive sparse coding solution, we show that the coherence control biases the exploration of the data manifold, sometimes yielding suboptimal solutions. We provide a theoretical explanation of these failures and, based on the theory, propose improved overcomplete ICA algorithms. All told, this study contributes new insights into and methods for coherence control for linear ICA, some of which are applicable to many other, potentially nonlinear, unsupervised learning methods."}
{"text": "  We propose to learn multiple local Mahalanobis distance metrics to perform k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification of temporal sequences. Temporal sequences are first aligned by dynamic time warping (DTW); given the alignment path, similarity between two sequences is measured by the DTW distance, which is computed as the accumulated distance between matched temporal point pairs along the alignment path. Traditionally, Euclidean metric is used for distance computation between matched pairs, which ignores the data regularities and might not be optimal for applications at hand. Here we propose to learn multiple Mahalanobis metrics, such that DTW distance becomes the sum of Mahalanobis distances. We adapt the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) framework to our case, and formulate multiple metric learning as a linear programming problem. Extensive sequence classification results show that our proposed multiple metrics learning approach is effective, insensitive to the preceding alignment qualities, and reaches the state-of-the-art performances on UCR time series datasets."}
{"text": "  We study a surprising phenomenon related to the representation of a cloud of data points using polynomials. We start with the previously unnoticed empirical observation that, given a collection (a cloud) of data points, the sublevel sets of a certain distinguished polynomial capture the shape of the cloud very accurately. This distinguished polynomial is a sum-of-squares (SOS) derived in a simple manner from the inverse of the empirical moment matrix. In fact, this SOS polynomial is directly related to orthogonal polynomials and the Christoffel function. This allows to generalize and interpret extremality properties of orthogonal polynomials and to provide a mathematical rationale for the observed phenomenon. Among diverse potential applications, we illustrate the relevance of our results on a network intrusion detection task for which we obtain performances similar to existing dedicated methods reported in the literature."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the quantification of the prediction performance in Gaussian process regression. The standard approach is to base the prediction error bars on the theoretical predictive variance, which is a lower bound on the mean square-error (MSE). This approach, however, does not take into account that the statistical model is learned from the data. We show that this omission leads to a systematic underestimation of the prediction errors. Starting from a generalization of the Cram\\'er-Rao bound, we derive a more accurate MSE bound which provides a measure of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes. The improved bound is easily computed and we illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples. of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes and illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples."}
{"text": "  We propose a framework for training multiple neural networks simultaneously. The parameters from all models are regularised by the tensor trace norm, so that each neural network is encouraged to reuse others' parameters if possible -- this is the main motivation behind multi-task learning. In contrast to many deep multi-task learning models, we do not predefine a parameter sharing strategy by specifying which layers have tied parameters. Instead, our framework considers sharing for all shareable layers, and the sharing strategy is learned in a data-driven way."}
{"text": "  Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been successfully applied to learn deep generative models for characterizing a joint distribution of variables via kernel mean embedding. In this paper, we present conditional generative moment- matching networks (CGMMN), which learn a conditional distribution given some input variables based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) criterion. The learning is performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradient calculated by back-propagation. We evaluate CGMMN on a wide range of tasks, including predictive modeling, contextual generation, and Bayesian dark knowledge, which distills knowledge from a Bayesian model by learning a relatively small CGMMN student network. Our results demonstrate competitive performance in all the tasks."}
{"text": "  Pairwise learning or dyadic prediction concerns the prediction of properties for pairs of objects. It can be seen as an umbrella covering various machine learning problems such as matrix completion, collaborative filtering, multi-task learning, transfer learning, network prediction and zero-shot learning. In this work we analyze kernel-based methods for pairwise learning, with a particular focus on a recently-suggested two-step method. We show that this method offers an appealing alternative for commonly-applied Kronecker-based methods that model dyads by means of pairwise feature representations and pairwise kernels. In a series of theoretical results, we establish correspondences between the two types of methods in terms of linear algebra and spectral filtering, and we analyze their statistical consistency. In addition, the two-step method allows us to establish novel algorithmic shortcuts for efficient training and validation on very large datasets. Putting those properties together, we believe that this simple, yet powerful method can become a standard tool for many problems. Extensive experimental results for a range of practical settings are reported."}
{"text": "  In this paper we develop a method for learning nonlinear systems with multiple outputs and inputs. We begin by modelling the errors of a nominal predictor of the system using a latent variable framework. Then using the maximum likelihood principle we derive a criterion for learning the model. The resulting optimization problem is tackled using a majorization-minimization approach. Finally, we develop a convex majorization technique and show that it enables a recursive identification method. The method learns parsimonious predictive models and is tested on both synthetic and real nonlinear systems."}
{"text": "  In this work we study variance in the results of neural network training on a wide variety of configurations in automatic speech recognition. Although this variance itself is well known, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper that performs an extensive empirical study on its effects in speech recognition. We view training as sampling from a distribution and show that these distributions can have a substantial variance. These results show the urgent need to rethink the way in which results in the literature are reported and interpreted."}
{"text": "  We consider sequential decision problems in which we adaptively choose one of finitely many alternatives and observe a stochastic reward. We offer a new perspective of interpreting Bayesian ranking and selection problems as adaptive stochastic multi-set maximization problems and derive the first finite-time bound of the knowledge-gradient policy for adaptive submodular objective functions. In addition, we introduce the concept of prior-optimality and provide another insight into the performance of the knowledge gradient policy based on the submodular assumption on the value of information. We demonstrate submodularity for the two-alternative case and provide other conditions for more general problems, bringing out the issue and importance of submodularity in learning problems. Empirical experiments are conducted to further illustrate the finite time behavior of the knowledge gradient policy."}
{"text": "  Unsupervised learning is the most challenging problem in machine learning and especially in deep learning. Among many scenarios, we study an unsupervised learning problem of high economic value --- learning to predict without costly pairing of input data and corresponding labels. Part of the difficulty in this problem is a lack of solid evaluation measures. In this paper, we take a practical approach to grounding unsupervised learning by using the same success criterion as for supervised learning in prediction tasks but we do not require the presence of paired input-output training data. In particular, we propose an objective function that aims to make the predicted outputs fit well the structure of the output while preserving the correlation between the input and the predicted output. We experiment with a synthetic structural prediction problem and show that even with simple linear classifiers, the objective function is already highly non-convex. We further demonstrate the nature of this non-convex optimization problem as well as potential solutions. In particular, we show that with regularization via a generative model, learning with the proposed unsupervised objective function converges to an optimal solution."}
{"text": "  Learning to solve complex sequences of tasks--while both leveraging transfer and avoiding catastrophic forgetting--remains a key obstacle to achieving human-level intelligence. The progressive networks approach represents a step forward in this direction: they are immune to forgetting and can leverage prior knowledge via lateral connections to previously learned features. We evaluate this architecture extensively on a wide variety of reinforcement learning tasks (Atari and 3D maze games), and show that it outperforms common baselines based on pretraining and finetuning. Using a novel sensitivity measure, we demonstrate that transfer occurs at both low-level sensory and high-level control layers of the learned policy."}
{"text": "  We introduce Network Maximal Correlation (NMC) as a multivariate measure of nonlinear association among random variables. NMC is defined via an optimization that infers transformations of variables by maximizing aggregate inner products between transformed variables. For finite discrete and jointly Gaussian random variables, we characterize a solution of the NMC optimization using basis expansion of functions over appropriate basis functions. For finite discrete variables, we propose an algorithm based on alternating conditional expectation to determine NMC. Moreover we propose a distributed algorithm to compute an approximation of NMC for large and dense graphs using graph partitioning. For finite discrete variables, we show that the probability of discrepancy greater than any given level between NMC and NMC computed using empirical distributions decays exponentially fast as the sample size grows. For jointly Gaussian variables, we show that under some conditions the NMC optimization is an instance of the Max-Cut problem. We then illustrate an application of NMC in inference of graphical model for bijective functions of jointly Gaussian variables. Finally, we show NMC's utility in a data application of learning nonlinear dependencies among genes in a cancer dataset."}
{"text": "  Good sparse approximations are essential for practical inference in Gaussian Processes as the computational cost of exact methods is prohibitive for large datasets. The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) and the Variational Free Energy (VFE) approximations are two recent popular methods. Despite superficial similarities, these approximations have surprisingly different theoretical properties and behave differently in practice. We thoroughly investigate the two methods for regression both analytically and through illustrative examples, and draw conclusions to guide practical application."}
{"text": "  Decoding, ie prediction from brain images or signals, calls for empirical evaluation of its predictive power. Such evaluation is achieved via cross-validation, a method also used to tune decoders' hyper-parameters. This paper is a review on cross-validation procedures for decoding in neuroimaging. It includes a didactic overview of the relevant theoretical considerations. Practical aspects are highlighted with an extensive empirical study of the common decoders in within-and across-subject predictions, on multiple datasets --anatomical and functional MRI and MEG-- and simulations. Theory and experiments outline that the popular \" leave-one-out \" strategy leads to unstable and biased estimates, and a repeated random splits method should be preferred. Experiments outline the large error bars of cross-validation in neuroimaging settings: typical confidence intervals of 10%. Nested cross-validation can tune decoders' parameters while avoiding circularity bias. However we find that it can be more favorable to use sane defaults, in particular for non-sparse decoders."}
{"text": "  We introduce the Mondrian kernel, a fast random feature approximation to the Laplace kernel. It is suitable for both batch and online learning, and admits a fast kernel-width-selection procedure as the random features can be re-used efficiently for all kernel widths. The features are constructed by sampling trees via a Mondrian process [Roy and Teh, 2009], and we highlight the connection to Mondrian forests [Lakshminarayanan et al., 2014], where trees are also sampled via a Mondrian process, but fit independently. This link provides a new insight into the relationship between kernel methods and random forests."}
{"text": "  Regression trees are becoming increasingly popular as omnibus predicting tools and as the basis of numerous modern statistical learning ensembles. Part of their popularity is their ability to create a regression prediction without ever specifying a structure for the mean model. However, the method implicitly assumes homogeneous variance across the entire explanatory-variable space. It is unknown how the algorithm behaves when faced with heteroscedastic data. In this study, we assess the performance of the most popular regression-tree algorithm in a single-variable setting under a very simple step-function model for heteroscedasticity. We use simulation to show that the locations of splits, and hence the ability to accurately predict means, are both adversely influenced by the change in variance. We identify the pruning algorithm as the main concern, although the effects on the splitting algorithm may be meaningful in some applications."}
{"text": "  Infinite--Layer Networks (ILN) have recently been proposed as an architecture that mimics neural networks while enjoying some of the advantages of kernel methods. ILN are networks that integrate over infinitely many nodes within a single hidden layer. It has been demonstrated by several authors that the problem of learning ILN can be reduced to the kernel trick, implying that whenever a certain integral can be computed analytically they are efficiently learnable.   In this work we give an online algorithm for ILN, which avoids the kernel trick assumption. More generally and of independent interest, we show that kernel methods in general can be exploited even when the kernel cannot be efficiently computed but can only be estimated via sampling.   We provide a regret analysis for our algorithm, showing that it matches the sample complexity of methods which have access to kernel values. Thus, our method is the first to demonstrate that the kernel trick is not necessary as such, and random features suffice to obtain comparable performance."}
{"text": "  Tree ensembles, such as random forest and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance, whereas their interpretability is critically limited. In this paper, we propose a post processing method that improves the model interpretability of tree ensembles. After learning a complex tree ensembles in a standard way, we approximate it by a simpler model that is interpretable for human. To obtain the simpler model, we derive the EM algorithm minimizing the KL divergence from the complex ensemble. A synthetic experiment showed that a complicated tree ensemble was approximated reasonably as interpretable."}
{"text": "  This paper discusses about an R package that implements the Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been successfully applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction. The clustering part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its implementation with minimum efforts. This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also provides a simple example of usage. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study the support vector machine and introduced the notion of generalized support vector machine for classification of data.

{"text": "  Improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of brain decoding models. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, we present a simple definition for interpretability of linear brain decoding models. Then, we propose to combine the interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our preliminary results on the toy data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative linear models. The presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability in linear brain decoding."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a group sparse vector from a small number of linear measurements. In the past the common approach has been to use various \"group sparsity-inducing\" norms such as the Group LASSO norm for this purpose. By using the theory of convex relaxations, we show that it is also possible to use $\\ell_1$-norm minimization for group sparse recovery. We introduce a new concept called group robust null space property (GRNSP), and show that, under suitable conditions, a group version of the restricted isometry property (GRIP) implies the GRNSP, and thus leads to group sparse recovery. When all groups are of equal size, our bounds are less conservative than known bounds. Moreover, our results apply even to situations where where the groups have different sizes. When specialized to conventional sparsity, our bounds reduce to one of the well-known \"best possible\" conditions for sparse recovery. This relationship between GRNSP and GRIP is new even for conventional sparsity, and substantially streamlines the proofs of some known results. Using this relationship, we derive bounds on the $\\ell_p$-norm of the residual error vector for all $p \\in [1,2]$, and not just when $p = 2$. When the measurement matrix consists of random samples of a sub-Gaussian random variable, we present bounds on the number of measurements, which are less conservative than currently known bounds."}
{"text": "  ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) is a single hidden layer feed-forward network, where the weights between input and hidden layer are initialized randomly. ELM is efficient due to its utilization of the analytical approach to compute weights between hidden and output layer. However, ELM still fails to output the semantic classification outcome. To address such limitation, in this paper, we propose a diversified top-k shapelets transform framework, where the shapelets are the subsequences i.e., the best representative and interpretative features of each class. As we identified, the most challenge problems are how to extract the best k shapelets in original candidate sets and how to automatically determine the k value. Specifically, we first define the similar shapelets and diversified top-k shapelets to construct diversity shapelets graph. Then, a novel diversity graph based top-k shapelets extraction algorithm named as \\textbf{DivTopkshapelets}\\ is proposed to search top-k diversified shapelets. Finally, we propose a shapelets transformed ELM algorithm named as \\textbf{DivShapELM} to automatically determine the k value, which is further utilized for time series classification. The experimental results over public data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional ELM algorithm in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."}
{"text": "  Fisher information and natural gradient provided deep insights and powerful tools to artificial neural networks. However related analysis becomes more and more difficult as the learner's structure turns large and complex. This paper makes a preliminary step towards a new direction. We extract a local component of a large neuron system, and defines its relative Fisher information metric that describes accurately this small component, and is invariant to the other parts of the system. This concept is important because the geometry structure is much simplified and it can be easily applied to guide the learning of neural networks. We provide an analysis on a list of commonly used components, and demonstrate how to use this concept to further improve optimization."}
{"text": "  We introduce a general and simple structural design called Multiplicative Integration (MI) to improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs). MI changes the way in which information from difference sources flows and is integrated in the computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models."}
{"text": "  Graph Signal Processing generalizes classical signal processing to signal or data indexed by the vertices of a weighted graph. So far, the research efforts have been focused on static graph signals. However numerous applications involve graph signals evolving in time, such as spreading or propagation of waves on a network. The analysis of this type of data requires a new set of methods that fully takes into account the time and graph dimensions. We propose a novel class of wavelet frames named Dynamic Graph Wavelets, whose time-vertex evolution follows a dynamic process. We demonstrate that this set of functions can be combined with sparsity based approaches such as compressive sensing to reveal information on the dynamic processes occurring on a graph. Experiments on real seismological data show the efficiency of the technique, allowing to estimate the epicenter of earthquake events recorded by a seismic network."}
{"text": "  Acquiring labels are often costly, whereas unlabeled data are usually easy to obtain in modern machine learning applications. Semi-supervised learning provides a principled machine learning framework to address such situations, and has been applied successfully in many real-word applications and industries. Nonetheless, most of existing semi-supervised learning methods encounter two serious limitations when applied to modern and large-scale datasets: computational burden and memory usage demand. To this end, we present in this paper the Graph-based semi-supervised Kernel Machine (GKM), a method that leverages the generalization ability of kernel-based method with the geometrical and distributive information formulated through a spectral graph induced from data for semi-supervised learning purpose. Our proposed GKM can be solved directly in the primal form using the Stochastic Gradient Descent method with the ideal convergence rate $O(\\frac{1}{T})$. Besides, our formulation is suitable for a wide spectrum of important loss functions in the literature of machine learning (e.g., Hinge, smooth Hinge, Logistic, L1, and {\\epsilon}-insensitive) and smoothness functions (i.e., $l_p(t) = |t|^p$ with $p\\ge1$). We further show that the well-known Laplacian Support Vector Machine is a special case of our formulation. We validate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that GKM is appropriate for the large-scale datasets since it is optimal in memory usage and yields superior classification accuracy whilst simultaneously achieving a significant computation speed-up in comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines."}
{"text": "  We consider training probabilistic classifiers in the case of a large number of classes. The number of classes is assumed too large to perform exact normalisation over all classes. To account for this we consider a simple approach that directly approximates the likelihood. We show that this simple approach works well on toy problems and is competitive with recently introduced alternative non-likelihood based approximations. Furthermore, we relate this approach to a simple ranking objective. This leads us to suggest a specific setting for the optimal threshold in the ranking objective."}
{"text": "  We study a two-level multiview learning with more than two views under the PAC-Bayesian framework. This approach, sometimes referred as late fusion, consists in learning sequentially multiple view-specific classifiers at the first level, and then combining these view-specific classifiers at the second level. Our main theoretical result is a generalization bound on the risk of the majority vote which exhibits a term of diversity in the predictions of the view-specific classifiers. From this result it comes out that controlling the trade-off between diversity and accuracy is a key element for multiview learning, which complements other results in multiview learning. Finally, we experiment our principle on multiview datasets extracted from the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collection."}
{"text": "  Process mining techniques focus on extracting insight in processes from event logs. In many cases, events recorded in the event log are too fine-grained, causing process discovery algorithms to discover incomprehensible process models or process models that are not representative of the event log. We show that when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an unrepresentative process model from a low-level event log, structure in the process can in some cases still be discovered by first abstracting the event log to a higher level of granularity. This gives rise to the challenge to bridge the gap between an original low-level event log and a desired high-level perspective on this log, such that a more structured or more comprehensible process model can be discovered. We show that supervised learning can be leveraged for the event abstraction task when annotations with high-level interpretations of the low-level events are available for a subset of the sequences (i.e., traces). We present a method to generate feature vector representations of events based on XES extensions, and describe an approach to abstract events in an event log with Condition Random Fields using these event features. Furthermore, we propose a sequence-focused metric to evaluate supervised event abstraction results that fits closely to the tasks of process discovery and conformance checking. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the usefulness of supervised event abstraction for obtaining more structured and/or more comprehensible process models using both real life event data and synthetic event data."}
{"text": "  Szubert and Jaskowski successfully used temporal difference (TD) learning together with n-tuple networks for playing the game 2048. However, we observed a phenomenon that the programs based on TD learning still hardly reach large tiles. In this paper, we propose multi-stage TD (MS-TD) learning, a kind of hierarchical reinforcement learning method, to effectively improve the performance for the rates of reaching large tiles, which are good metrics to analyze the strength of 2048 programs. Our experiments showed significant improvements over the one without using MS-TD learning. Namely, using 3-ply expectimax search, the program with MS-TD learning reached 32768-tiles with a rate of 18.31%, while the one with TD learning did not reach any. After further tuned, our 2048 program reached 32768-tiles with a rate of 31.75% in 10,000 games, and one among these games even reached a 65536-tile, which is the first ever reaching a 65536-tile to our knowledge. In addition, MS-TD learning method can be easily applied to other 2048-like games, such as Threes. Based on MS-TD learning, our experiments for Threes also demonstrated similar performance improvement, where the program with MS-TD learning reached 6144-tiles with a rate of 7.83%, while the one with TD learning only reached 0.45%."}
{"text": "  The goal of minimizing misclassification error on a training set is often just one of several real-world goals that might be defined on different datasets. For example, one may require a classifier to also make positive predictions at some specified rate for some subpopulation (fairness), or to achieve a specified empirical recall. Other real-world goals include reducing churn with respect to a previously deployed model, or stabilizing online training. In this paper we propose handling multiple goals on multiple datasets by training with dataset constraints, using the ramp penalty to accurately quantify costs, and present an efficient algorithm to approximately optimize the resulting non-convex constrained optimization problem. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world industry datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "  We propose a probabilistic modeling framework for learning the dynamic patterns in the collective behaviors of social agents and developing profiles for different behavioral groups, using data collected from multiple information sources. The proposed model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian process, in which each observation is a finite mixture of an set of latent groups and the mixture proportions (i.e., group probabilities) are drawn randomly. Each group is associated with some distributions over a finite set of outcomes. Moreover, as time evolves, the structure of these groups also changes; we model the change in the group structure by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a fixed transition probability. We present an efficient inference method based on tensor decompositions and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation."}
{"text": "  When observations are organized into groups where commonalties exist amongst them, the dependent random measures can be an ideal choice for modeling. One of the propositions of the dependent random measures is that the atoms of the posterior distribution are shared amongst groups, and hence groups can borrow information from each other. When normalized dependent random measures prior with independent increments are applied, we can derive appropriate exchangeable probability partition function (EPPF), and subsequently also deduce its inference algorithm given any mixture model likelihood. We provide all necessary derivation and solution to this framework. For demonstration, we used mixture of Gaussians likelihood in combination with a dependent structure constructed by linear combinations of CRMs. Our experiments show superior performance when using this framework, where the inferred values including the mixing weights and the number of clusters both respond appropriately to the number of completely random measure used."}
{"text": "  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were recently proposed for the session-based recommendation task. The models showed promising improvements over traditional recommendation approaches. In this work, we further study RNN-based models for session-based recommendations. We propose the application of two techniques to improve model performance, namely, data augmentation, and a method to account for shifts in the input data distribution. We also empirically study the use of generalised distillation, and a novel alternative model that directly predicts item embeddings. Experiments on the RecSys Challenge 2015 dataset demonstrate relative improvements of 12.8% and 14.8% over previously reported results on the Recall@20 and Mean Reciprocal Rank@20 metrics respectively."}
{"text": "  We propose the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a high-performing neural network activation function. The GELU activation function is $x\\Phi(x)$, where $\\Phi(x)$ the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function. The GELU nonlinearity weights inputs by their value, rather than gates inputs by their sign as in ReLUs ($x\\mathbf{1}_{x>0}$). We perform an empirical evaluation of the GELU nonlinearity against the ReLU and ELU activations and find performance improvements across all considered computer vision, natural language processing, and speech tasks."}
{"text": "  A novel dynamic Bayesian nonparametric topic model for anomaly detection in video is proposed in this paper. Batch and online Gibbs samplers are developed for inference. The paper introduces a new abnormality measure for decision making. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real data. The comparison with a non-dynamic model shows the superiority of the proposed dynamic one in terms of the classification performance for anomaly detection."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes a novel dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process topic model that considers the dependence between successive observations. Conventional posterior inference algorithms for this kind of models require processing of the whole data through several passes. It is computationally intractable for massive or sequential data. We design the batch and online inference algorithms, based on the Gibbs sampling, for the proposed model. It allows to process sequential data, incrementally updating the model by a new observation. The model is applied to abnormal behaviour detection in video sequences. A new abnormality measure is proposed for decision making. The proposed method is compared with the method based on the non- dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, for which we also derive the online Gibbs sampler and the abnormality measure. The results with synthetic and real data show that the consideration of the dynamics in a topic model improves the classification performance for abnormal behaviour detection."}
{"text": "  A particularly interesting instance of supervised learning with kernels is when each training example is associated with two objects, as in pairwise classification (Brunner et al., 2012), and in supervised learning of preference relations (Herbrich et al., 1998). In these cases, one may want to embed additional prior knowledge into the optimization problem associated with the training of the learning machine, modeled, respectively, by the symmetry of its optimal solution with respect to an exchange of order between the two objects, and by its antisymmetry. Extending the approach proposed in (Brunner et al., 2012) (where the only symmetric case was considered), we show, focusing on support vector binary classification, how such embedding is possible through the choice of a suitable pairwise kernel, which takes as inputs the individual feature vectors and also the group feature vectors associated with the two objects. We also prove that the symmetry/antisymmetry constraints still hold when considering the sequence of suboptimal solutions generated by one version of the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm, and we present numerical results supporting the theoretical findings. We conclude discussing extensions of the main results to support vector regression, to transductive support vector machines, and to several kinds of graph kernels, including diffusion kernels."}
{"text": "  Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a framework for performing likelihood-free posterior inference for simulation models. Stochastic Variational inference (SVI) is an appealing alternative to the inefficient sampling approaches commonly used in ABC. However, SVI is highly sensitive to the variance of the gradient estimators, and this problem is exacerbated by approximating the likelihood. We draw upon recent advances in variance reduction for SV and likelihood-free inference using deterministic simulations to produce low variance gradient estimators of the variational lower-bound. By then exploiting automatic differentiation libraries we can avoid nearly all model-specific derivations. We demonstrate performance on three problems and compare to existing SVI algorithms. Our results demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm."}
{"text": "  Deep learning methods such as multitask neural networks have recently been applied to ligand-based virtual screening and other drug discovery applications. Using a set of industrial ADMET datasets, we compare neural networks to standard baseline models and analyze multitask learning effects with both random cross-validation and a more relevant temporal validation scheme. We confirm that multitask learning can provide modest benefits over single-task models and show that smaller datasets tend to benefit more than larger datasets from multitask learning. Additionally, we find that adding massive amounts of side information is not guaranteed to improve performance relative to simpler multitask learning. Our results emphasize that multitask effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the use of dataset-specific models to maximize overall performance."}
{"text": "  Contagions such as the spread of popular news stories, or infectious diseases, propagate in cascades over dynamic networks with unobservable topologies. However, \"social signals\" such as product purchase time, or blog entry timestamps are measurable, and implicitly depend on the underlying topology, making it possible to track it over time. Interestingly, network topologies often \"jump\" between discrete states that may account for sudden changes in the observed signals. The present paper advocates a switched dynamic structural equation model to capture the topology-dependent cascade evolution, as well as the discrete states driving the underlying topologies. Conditions under which the proposed switched model is identifiable are established. Leveraging the edge sparsity inherent to social networks, a recursive $\\ell_1$-norm regularized least-squares estimator is put forth to jointly track the states and network topologies. An efficient first-order proximal-gradient algorithm is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Numerical experiments on both synthetic data and real cascades measured over the span of one year are conducted, and test results corroborate the efficacy of the advocated approach."}
{"text": "  We consider learning high-dimensional multi-response linear models with structured parameters. By exploiting the noise correlations among responses, we propose an alternating estimation (AltEst) procedure to estimate the model parameters based on the generalized Dantzig selector. Under suitable sample size and resampling assumptions, we show that the error of the estimates generated by AltEst, with high probability, converges linearly to certain minimum achievable level, which can be tersely expressed by a few geometric measures, such as Gaussian width of sets related to the parameter structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-asymptotic statistical guarantee for such AltEst-type algorithm applied to estimation problem with general structures."}
{"text": "  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a class of supervised learning tasks and techniques that also exploits the unlabeled data for training. SSL significantly reduces labeling related costs and is able to handle large data sets. The primary objective is the extraction of robust inference rules. Decision support systems (DSSs) who utilize SSL have significant advantages. Only a small amount of labelled data is required for the initialization. Then, new (unlabeled) data can be utilized and improve system's performance. Thus, the DSS is continuously adopted to new conditions, with minimum effort. Techniques which are cost effective and easily adopted to dynamic systems, can be beneficial for many practical applications. Such applications fields are: (a) industrial assembly lines monitoring, (b) sea border surveillance, (c) elders' falls detection, (d) transportation tunnels inspection, (e) concrete foundation piles defect recognition, (f) commercial sector companies financial assessment and (g) image advanced filtering for cultural heritage applications."}
{"text": "  Tree ensembles, such as random forests and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance. However, their interpretability is critically limited due to the enormous complexity. In this study, we present a method to make a complex tree ensemble interpretable by simplifying the model. Specifically, we formalize the simplification of tree ensembles as a model selection problem. Given a complex tree ensemble, we aim at obtaining the simplest representation that is essentially equivalent to the original one. To this end, we derive a Bayesian model selection algorithm that optimizes the simplified model while maintaining the prediction performance. Our numerical experiments on several datasets showed that complicated tree ensembles were reasonably approximated as interpretable."}
{"text": "  Sample efficiency is a critical property when optimizing policy parameters for the controller of a robot. In this paper, we evaluate two state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms. One is a recent deep reinforcement learning method based on an actor-critic algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), that has been shown to perform well on various control benchmarks. The other one is a direct policy search method, Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), a black-box optimization method that is widely used for robot learning. The algorithms are evaluated on a continuous version of the mountain car benchmark problem, so as to compare their sample complexity. From a preliminary analysis, we expect DDPG to be more sample efficient than CMA-ES, which is confirmed by our experimental results."}
{"text": "  The problem of finding overlapping communities in networks has gained much attention recently. Optimization-based approaches use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or variants, but the global optimum cannot be provably attained in general. Model-based approaches, such as the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel or MMSB (Airoldi et al., 2008), use parameters for each node to specify the overlapping communities, but standard inference techniques cannot guarantee consistency. We link the two approaches, by (a) establishing sufficient conditions for the symmetric NMF optimization to have a unique solution under MMSB, and (b) proposing a computationally efficient algorithm called GeoNMF that is provably optimal and hence consistent for a broad parameter regime. We demonstrate its accuracy on both simulated and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "  A catastrophic forgetting problem makes deep neural networks forget the previously learned information, when learning data collected in new environments, such as by different sensors or in different light conditions. This paper presents a new method for alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem. Unlike previous research, our method does not use any information from the source domain. Surprisingly, our method is very effective to forget less of the information in the source domain, and we show the effectiveness of our method using several experiments. Furthermore, we observed that the forgetting problem occurs between mini-batches when performing general training processes using stochastic gradient descent methods, and this problem is one of the factors that degrades generalization performance of the network. We also try to solve this problem using the proposed method. Finally, we show our less-forgetting learning method is also helpful to improve the performance of deep neural networks in terms of recognition rates."}
{"text": "  The presence of outliers is prevalent in machine learning applications and may produce misleading results. In this paper a new method for dealing with outliers and anomal samples is proposed. To overcome the outlier issue, the proposed method combines the global and local views of the samples. By combination of these views, our algorithm performs in a robust manner. The experimental results show the capabilities of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites play an important role in addressing health information needs. However, a significant number of posted questions remain unanswered. Automatically answering the posted questions can provide a useful source of information for online health communities. In this study, we developed an algorithm to automatically answer health-related questions based on past questions and answers (QA). We also aimed to understand information embedded within online health content that are good features in identifying valid answers. Our proposed algorithm uses information retrieval techniques to identify candidate answers from resolved QA. In order to rank these candidates, we implemented a semi-supervised leaning algorithm that extracts the best answer to a question. We assessed this approach on a curated corpus from Yahoo! Answers and compared against a rule-based string similarity baseline. On our dataset, the semi-supervised learning algorithm has an accuracy of 86.2%. UMLS-based (health-related) features used in the model enhance the algorithm's performance by proximately 8 %. A reasonably high rate of accuracy is obtained given that the data is considerably noisy. Important features distinguishing a valid answer from an invalid answer include text length, number of stop words contained in a test question, a distance between the test question and other questions in the corpus as well as a number of overlapping health-related terms between questions. Overall, our automated QA system based on historical QA pairs is shown to be effective according to the data set in this case study. It is developed for general use in the health care domain which can also be applied to other CQA sites."}
{"text": "  Probabilistic programming languages represent complex data with intermingled models in a few lines of code. Efficient inference algorithms in probabilistic programming languages make possible to build unified frameworks to compute interesting probabilities of various large, real-world problems. When the structure of model is given, constructing a probabilistic program is rather straightforward. Thus, main focus have been to learn the best model parameters and compute marginal probabilities. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to build expressive probabilistic program from continue time series data when the structure of model is not given. The intuition behind of our method is to find a descriptive covariance structure of time series data in nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We report that such descriptive covariance structure efficiently derives a probabilistic programming description accurately."}
{"text": "  Bipartite ranking is a fundamental machine learning and data mining problem. It commonly concerns the maximization of the AUC metric. Recently, a number of studies have proposed online bipartite ranking algorithms to learn from massive streams of class-imbalanced data. These methods suggest both linear and kernel-based bipartite ranking algorithms based on first and second-order online learning. Unlike kernelized ranker, linear ranker is more scalable learning algorithm. The existing linear online bipartite ranking algorithms lack either handling non-separable data or constructing adaptive large margin. These limitations yield unreliable bipartite ranking performance. In this work, we propose a linear online confidence-weighted bipartite ranking algorithm (CBR) that adopts soft confidence-weighted learning. The proposed algorithm leverages the same properties of soft confidence-weighted learning in a framework for bipartite ranking. We also develop a diagonal variation of the proposed confidence-weighted bipartite ranking algorithm to deal with high-dimensional data by maintaining only the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on several benchmark and high-dimensional datasets. The experimental results validate the reliability of the proposed algorithms. The results also show that our algorithms outperform or are at least comparable to the competing online AUC maximization methods."}
{"text": "  We present new algorithms for adaptively learning artificial neural networks. Our algorithms (AdaNet) adaptively learn both the structure of the network and its weights. They are based on a solid theoretical analysis, including data-dependent generalization guarantees that we prove and discuss in detail. We report the results of large-scale experiments with one of our algorithms on several binary classification tasks extracted from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results demonstrate that our algorithm can automatically learn network structures with very competitive performance accuracies when compared with those achieved for neural networks found by standard approaches."}
{"text": "  Given a graph in which a few vertices are deemed interesting a priori, the vertex nomination task is to order the remaining vertices into a nomination list such that there is a concentration of interesting vertices at the top of the list. Previous work has yielded several approaches to this problem, with theoretical results in the setting where the graph is drawn from a stochastic block model (SBM), including a vertex nomination analogue of the Bayes optimal classifier. In this paper, we prove that maximum likelihood (ML)-based vertex nomination is consistent, in the sense that the performance of the ML-based scheme asymptotically matches that of the Bayes optimal scheme. We prove theorems of this form both when model parameters are known and unknown. Additionally, we introduce and prove consistency of a related, more scalable restricted-focus ML vertex nomination scheme. Finally, we incorporate vertex and edge features into ML-based vertex nomination and briefly explore the empirical effectiveness of this approach."}
{"text": "  Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data is organized in multiple levels (per-subject, per-day, etc.) and this particular structure should be taken into account in machine learning algorithms used in EMA like decision trees and its variants. We propose a new algorithm called BBT (standing for Bagged Boosted Trees) that is enhanced by a over/under sampling method and can provide better estimates for the conditional class probability function. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that BBT can benefit EMA data classification and performance."}
{"text": "  We propose a Bayesian nonparametric prior for time-varying networks. To each node of the network is associated a positive parameter, modeling the sociability of that node. Sociabilities are assumed to evolve over time, and are modeled via a dynamic point process model. The model is able to (a) capture smooth evolution of the interaction between nodes, allowing edges to appear/disappear over time (b) capture long term evolution of the sociabilities of the nodes (c) and yield sparse graphs, where the number of edges grows subquadratically with the number of nodes. The evolution of the sociabilities is described by a tractable time-varying gamma process. We provide some theoretical insights into the model and apply it to three real world datasets."}
{"text": "  We propose a vector-valued regression problem whose solution is equivalent to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding of the Bayesian posterior distribution. This equivalence provides a new understanding of kernel Bayesian inference. Moreover, the optimization problem induces a new regularization for the posterior embedding estimator, which is faster and has comparable performance to the squared regularization in kernel Bayes' rule. This regularization coincides with a former thresholding approach used in kernel POMDPs whose consistency remains to be established. Our theoretical work solves this open problem and provides consistency analysis in regression settings. Based on our optimizational formulation, we propose a flexible Bayesian posterior regularization framework which for the first time enables us to put regularization at the distribution level. We apply this method to nonparametric state-space filtering tasks with extremely nonlinear dynamics and show performance gains over all other baselines."}
{"text": "  We present a general framework for classifying partially observed dynamical systems based on the idea of learning in the model space. In contrast to the existing approaches using model point estimates to represent individual data items, we employ posterior distributions over models, thus taking into account in a principled manner the uncertainty due to both the generative (observational and/or dynamic noise) and observation (sampling in time) processes. We evaluate the framework on two testbeds - a biological pathway model and a stochastic double-well system. Crucially, we show that the classifier performance is not impaired when the model class used for inferring posterior distributions is much more simple than the observation-generating model class, provided the reduced complexity inferential model class captures the essential characteristics needed for the given classification task."}
{"text": "  The newsvendor problem is one of the most basic and widely applied inventory models. There are numerous extensions of this problem. If the probability distribution of the demand is known, the problem can be solved analytically.   However, approximating the probability distribution is not easy and is prone to error; therefore, the resulting solution to the newsvendor problem may be not optimal. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm based on deep learning that optimizes the order quantities for all products based on features of the demand data. Our algorithm integrates the forecasting and inventory-optimization steps, rather than solving them separately, as is typically done, and does not require knowledge of the probability distributions of the demand. Numerical experiments on real-world data suggest that our algorithm outperforms other approaches, including data-driven and machine learning approaches, especially for demands with high volatility. Finally, in order to show how this approach can be used for other inventory optimization problems, we provide an extension for (r,Q) policies."}
{"text": "  Tensor regression has shown to be advantageous in learning tasks with multi-directional relatedness. Given massive multiway data, traditional methods are often too slow to operate on or suffer from memory bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce subsampled tensor projected gradient to solve the problem. Our algorithm is impressively simple and efficient. It is built upon projected gradient method with fast tensor power iterations, leveraging randomized sketching for further acceleration. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the correct solution in fixed number of iterations. The memory requirement grows linearly with the size of the problem. We demonstrate superior empirical performance on both multi-linear multi-task learning and spatio-temporal applications."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of power allocation over a time-varying channel with unknown distribution in energy harvesting communication systems. In this problem, the transmitter has to choose the transmit power based on the amount of stored energy in its battery with the goal of maximizing the average rate obtained over time. We model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the transmitter as the agent, the battery status as the state, the transmit power as the action and the rate obtained as the reward. The average reward maximization problem over the MDP can be solved by a linear program (LP) that uses the transition probabilities for the state-action pairs and their reward values to choose a power allocation policy. Since the rewards associated the state-action pairs are unknown, we propose two online learning algorithms: UCLP and Epoch-UCLP that learn these rewards and adapt their policies along the way. The UCLP algorithm solves the LP at each step to decide its current policy using the upper confidence bounds on the rewards, while the Epoch-UCLP algorithm divides the time into epochs, solves the LP only at the beginning of the epochs and follows the obtained policy in that epoch. We prove that the reward losses or regrets incurred by both these algorithms are upper bounded by constants. Epoch-UCLP incurs a higher regret compared to UCLP, but reduces the computational requirements substantially. We also show that the presented algorithms work for online learning in cost minimization problems like the packet scheduling with power-delay tradeoff with minor changes."}
{"text": "  Manifold structure learning is often used to exploit geometric information among data in semi-supervised feature learning algorithms. In this paper, we find that local discriminative information is also of importance for semi-supervised feature learning. We propose a method that utilizes both the manifold structure of data and local discriminant information. Specifically, we define a local clique for each data point. The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is used to determine the structural information within each clique. We then employ a variant of Fisher criterion model to each clique for local discriminant evaluation and sum all cliques as global integration into the framework. In this way, local discriminant information is embedded. Labels are also utilized to minimize distances between data from the same class. In addition, we use the kernel method to extend our proposed model and facilitate feature learning in a high-dimensional space after feature mapping. Experimental results show that our method is superior to all other compared methods over a number of datasets."}
{"text": "  Additive nonparametric regression models provide an attractive tool for variable selection in high dimensions when the relationship between the response and predictors is complex. They offer greater flexibility compared to parametric non-linear regression models and better interpretability and scalability than the non-parametric regression models. However, achieving sparsity simultaneously in the number of nonparametric components as well as in the variables within each nonparametric component poses a stiff computational challenge. In this article, we develop a novel Bayesian additive regression model using a combination of hard and soft shrinkages to separately control the number of additive components and the variables within each component. An efficient algorithm is developed to select the importance variables and estimate the interaction network. Excellent performance is obtained in simulated and real data examples."}

However, quantile regression trees and their ensembles have not yet garnered much attention despite the increasing popularity of the linear quantile regression model. This work proposes a Bayesian quantile additive regression trees model that shows very good predictive performance illustrated using simulation studies and real data applications. Further extension to tackle binary classification problems is also considered."}
{"text": "  We propose thresholding as an approach to deal with class imbalance. We define the concept of thresholding as a process of determining a decision boundary in the presence of a tunable parameter. The threshold is the maximum value of this tunable parameter where the conditions of a certain decision are satisfied. We show that thresholding is applicable not only for linear classifiers but also for non-linear classifiers. We show that this is the implicit assumption for many approaches to deal with class imbalance in linear classifiers. We then extend this paradigm beyond linear classification and show how non-linear classification can be dealt with under this umbrella framework of thresholding. The proposed method can be used for outlier detection in many real-life scenarios like in manufacturing. In advanced manufacturing units, where the manufacturing process has matured over time, the number of instances (or parts) of the product that need to be rejected (based on a strict regime of quality tests) becomes relatively rare and are defined as outliers. How to detect these rare parts or outliers beforehand? How to detect combination of conditions leading to these outliers? These are the questions motivating our research. This paper focuses on prediction of outliers and conditions leading to outliers using classification. We address the problem of outlier detection using classification. The classes are good parts (those passing the quality tests) and bad parts (those failing the quality tests and can be considered as outliers). The rarity of outliers transforms this problem into a class-imbalanced classification problem."}

In this paper, we present a generalization of HMC which exploits \\textit{non-canonical} Hamiltonian dynamics. We refer to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dynamics map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field. We establish a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples where these non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary HMC."}
{"text": "  We study the fundamental problem of prediction with expert advice and develop regret lower bounds for a large family of algorithms for this problem. We develop simple adversarial primitives, that lend themselves to various combinations leading to sharp lower bounds for many algorithmic families. We use these primitives to show that the classic Multiplicative Weights Algorithm (MWA) has a regret of $\\sqrt{\\frac{T \\ln k}{2}}$, there by completely closing the gap between upper and lower bounds. We further show a regret lower bound of $\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{T\\ln k}{2}}$ for a much more general family of algorithms than MWA, where the learning rate can be arbitrarily varied over time, or even picked from arbitrary distributions over time. We also use our primitives to construct adversaries in the geometric horizon setting for MWA to precisely characterize the regret at $\\frac{0.391}{\\sqrt{\\delta}}$ for the case of $2$ experts and a lower bound of $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln k}{2\\delta}}$ for the case of arbitrary number of experts $k$."}
{"text": "  We present new methods to estimate causal effects retrospectively from micro data with the assistance of a machine learning ensemble. This approach overcomes two important limitations in conventional methods like regression modeling or matching: (i) ambiguity about the pertinent retrospective counterfactuals and (ii) potential misspecification, overfitting, and otherwise bias-prone or inefficient use of a large identifying covariate set in the estimation of causal effects. Our method targets the analysis toward a well defined ``retrospective intervention effect'' (RIE) based on hypothetical population interventions and applies a machine learning ensemble that allows data to guide us, in a controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set. We illustrate with an analysis of policy options for reducing ex-combatant recidivism in Colombia."}
{"text": "  We study the stream-based online active learning in a contextual multi-armed bandit framework. In this framework, the reward depends on both the arm and the context. In a stream-based active learning setting, obtaining the ground truth of the reward is costly, and the conventional contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm fails to achieve a sublinear regret due to this cost. Hence, the algorithm needs to determine whether or not to request the ground truth of the reward at current time slot. In our framework, we consider a stream-based active learning setting in which a query request for the ground truth is sent to the annotator, together with some prior information of the ground truth. Depending on the accuracy of the prior information, the query cost varies. Our algorithm mainly carries out two operations: the refinement of the context and arm spaces and the selection of actions. In our algorithm, the partitions of the context space and the arm space are maintained for a certain time slots, and then become finer as more information about the rewards accumulates. We use a strategic way to select the arms and to request the ground truth of the reward, aiming to maximize the total reward. We analytically show that the regret is sublinear and in the same order with that of the conventional contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms, where no query cost"}
{"text": "  Machine learning is the science of discovering statistical dependencies in data, and the use of those dependencies to perform predictions. During the last decade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human performance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and computer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning avoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way forward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human intelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms.   Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships between the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide understanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen environments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer \"what if\" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under hypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and effect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine intelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in specific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in practice.   This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways. First, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on copulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret the problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification, yielding a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover causal structures in convolutional neural network features using our algorithms. The algorithms presented in this thesis are scalable, exhibit strong theoretical guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of real-world benchmarks."}
{"text": "  Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as mixture models, are used for cluster analysis. These models have two types of variables: observable and latent. In cluster analysis, the latent variable is estimated, and it is expected that additional information will improve the accuracy of the estimation of the latent variable. Many proposed learning methods are able to use additional data; these include semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. However, from a statistical point of view, a complex probabilistic model that encompasses both the initial and additional data might be less accurate due to having a higher-dimensional parameter. The present paper presents a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of such a model and clarifies which factor has the greatest effect on its accuracy, the advantages of obtaining additional data, and the disadvantages of increasing the complexity."}
{"text": "  Assessing uncertainty is an important step towards ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems. Existing uncertainty estimation techniques may fail when their modeling assumptions are not met, e.g. when the data distribution differs from the one seen at training time. Here, we propose techniques that assess a classification algorithm's uncertainty via calibrated probabilities (i.e. probabilities that match empirical outcome frequencies in the long run) and which are guaranteed to be reliable (i.e. accurate and calibrated) on out-of-distribution input, including input generated by an adversary. This represents an extension of classical online learning that handles uncertainty in addition to guaranteeing accuracy under adversarial assumptions. We establish formal guarantees for our methods, and we validate them on two real-world problems: question answering and medical diagnosis from genomic data."}

{"text": "  We propose a reinforcement learning based approach to tackle the cost-sensitive learning problem where each input feature has a specific cost. The acquisition process is handled through a stochastic policy which allows features to be acquired in an adaptive way. The general architecture of our approach relies on representation learning to enable performing prediction on any partially observed sample, whatever the set of its observed features are. The resulting model is an original mix of representation learning and of reinforcement learning ideas. It is learned with policy gradient techniques to minimize a budgeted inference cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with several experiments on a variety of datasets for the sparse prediction problem where all features have the same cost, but also for some cost-sensitive settings."}
{"text": "  We study the density estimation problem with observations generated by certain dynamical systems that admit a unique underlying invariant Lebesgue density. Observations drawn from dynamical systems are not independent and moreover, usual mixing concepts may not be appropriate for measuring the dependence among these observations. By employing the $\\mathcal{C}$-mixing concept to measure the dependence, we conduct statistical analysis on the consistency and convergence of the kernel density estimator. Our main results are as follows: First, we show that with properly chosen bandwidth, the kernel density estimator is universally consistent under $L_1$-norm; Second, we establish convergence rates for the estimator with respect to several classes of dynamical systems under $L_1$-norm. In the analysis, the density function $f$ is only assumed to be H\\\"{o}lder continuous which is a weak assumption in the literature of nonparametric density estimation and also more realistic in the dynamical system context. Last but not least, we prove that the same convergence rates of the estimator under $L_\\infty$-norm and $L_1$-norm can be achieved when the density function is H\\\"{o}lder continuous, compactly supported and bounded. The bandwidth selection problem of the kernel density estimator for dynamical system is also discussed in our study via numerical simulations."}
{"text": "  An important problem in sequential decision-making under uncertainty is to use limited data to compute a safe policy, i.e., a policy that is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a given baseline strategy. In this paper, we develop and analyze a new model-based approach to compute a safe policy when we have access to an inaccurate dynamics model of the system with known accuracy guarantees. Our proposed robust method uses this (inaccurate) model to directly minimize the (negative) regret w.r.t. the baseline policy. Contrary to the existing approaches, minimizing the regret allows one to improve the baseline policy in states with accurate dynamics and seamlessly fall back to the baseline policy, otherwise. We show that our formulation is NP-hard and propose an approximate algorithm. Our empirical results on several domains show that even this relatively simple approximate algorithm can significantly outperform standard approaches."}
{"text": "  Spectral embedding uses eigenfunctions of the discrete Laplacian on a weighted graph to obtain coordinates for an embedding of an abstract data set into Euclidean space. We propose a new pre-processing step of first using the eigenfunctions to simulate a low-frequency wave moving over the data and using both position as well as change in time of the wave to obtain a refined metric to which classical methods of dimensionality reduction can then applied. This is motivated by the behavior of waves, symmetries of the wave equation and the hunting technique of bats. It is shown to be effective in practice and also works for other partial differential equations -- the method yields improved results even for the classical heat equation."}
{"text": "  For more than two centuries, solutions of differential equations have been obtained either analytically or numerically based on typically well-behaved forcing and boundary conditions for well-posed problems. We are changing this paradigm in a fundamental way by establishing an interface between probabilistic machine learning and differential equations. We develop data-driven algorithms for general linear equations using Gaussian process priors tailored to the corresponding integro-differential operators. The only observables are scarce noisy multi-fidelity data for the forcing and solution that are not required to reside on the domain boundary. The resulting predictive posterior distributions quantify uncertainty and naturally lead to adaptive solution refinement via active learning. This general framework circumvents the tyranny of numerical discretization as well as the consistency and stability issues of time-integration, and is scalable to high-dimensions."}
{"text": "  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a powerful tool for understanding human behaviour. Applying HAR to wearable sensors can provide new insights by enriching the feature set in health studies, and enhance the personalisation and effectiveness of health, wellness, and fitness applications. Wearable devices provide an unobtrusive platform for user monitoring, and due to their increasing market penetration, feel intrinsic to the wearer. The integration of these devices in daily life provide a unique opportunity for understanding human health and wellbeing. This is referred to as the \"quantified self\" movement. The analyses of complex health behaviours such as sleep, traditionally require a time-consuming manual interpretation by experts. This manual work is necessary due to the erratic periodicity and persistent noisiness of human behaviour. In this paper, we present a robust automated human activity recognition algorithm, which we call RAHAR. We test our algorithm in the application area of sleep research by providing a novel framework for evaluating sleep quality and examining the correlation between the aforementioned and an individual's physical activity. Our results improve the state-of-the-art procedure in sleep research by 15 percent for area under ROC and by 30 percent for F1 score on average. However, application of RAHAR is not limited to sleep analysis and can be used for understanding other health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiac diseases."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of identifying individuals based on their characteristic gaze patterns during reading of arbitrary text. The motivation for this problem is an unobtrusive biometric setting in which a user is observed during access to a document, but no specific challenge protocol requiring the user's time and attention is carried out. Existing models of individual differences in gaze control during reading are either based on simple aggregate features of eye movements, or rely on parametric density models to describe, for instance, saccade amplitudes or word fixation durations. We develop flexible semiparametric models of eye movements during reading in which densities are inferred under a Gaussian process prior centered at a parametric distribution family that is expected to approximate the true distribution well. An empirical study on reading data from 251 individuals shows significant improvements over the state of the art."}
{"text": "  This work falls within the context of predicting the value of a real function at some input locations given a limited number of observations of this function. The Kriging interpolation technique (or Gaussian process regression) is often considered to tackle such a problem but the method suffers from its computational burden when the number of observation points is large. We introduce in this article nested Kriging predictors which are constructed by aggregating sub-models based on subsets of observation points. This approach is proven to have better theoretical properties than other aggregation methods that can be found in the literature. Contrarily to some other methods it can be shown that the proposed aggregation method is consistent. Finally, the practical interest of the proposed method is illustrated on simulated datasets and on an industrial test case with $10^4$ observations in a 6-dimensional space."}
{"text": "  Concentration inequalities are indispensable tools for studying the generalization capacity of learning models. Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities are commonly used, giving bounds independent of the data distribution. Although this makes them widely applicable, a drawback is that the bounds can be too loose in some specific cases. Although efforts have been devoted to improving the bounds, we find that the bounds can be further tightened in some distribution-dependent scenarios and conditions for the inequalities can be relaxed. In particular, we propose four types of conditions for probabilistic boundedness and bounded differences, and derive several distribution-dependent extensions of Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities. These extensions provide bounds for functions not satisfying the conditions of the existing inequalities, and in some special cases, tighter bounds. Furthermore, we obtain generalization bounds for unbounded and hierarchy-bounded loss functions. Finally we discuss the potential applications of our extensions to learning theory."}
{"text": "  The traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms generate an exponentially large number of patterns of which a substantial proportion are not much significant for many data analysis endeavors. Discovery of a small number of personalized interesting patterns from the large output set according to a particular user's interest is an important as well as challenging task. Existing works on pattern summarization do not solve this problem from the personalization viewpoint. In this work, we propose an interactive pattern discovery framework named PRIIME which identifies a set of interesting patterns for a specific user without requiring any prior input on the interestingness measure of patterns from the user. The proposed framework is generic to support discovery of the interesting set, sequence and graph type patterns. We develop a softmax classification based iterative learning algorithm that uses a limited number of interactive feedback from the user to learn her interestingness profile, and use this profile for pattern recommendation. To handle sequence and graph type patterns PRIIME adopts a neural net (NN) based unsupervised feature construction approach. We also develop a strategy that combines exploration and exploitation to select patterns for feedback. We show experimental results on several real-life datasets to validate the performance of the proposed method. We also compare with the existing methods of interactive pattern discovery to show that our method is substantially superior in performance. To portray the applicability of the framework, we present a case study from the real-estate domain."}
{"text": "  We propose a method that performs anomaly detection and localisation within heterogeneous data using a pairwise undirected mixed graphical model. The data are a mixture of categorical and quantitative variables, and the model is learned over a dataset that is supposed not to contain any anomaly. We then use the model over temporal data, potentially a data stream, using a version of the two-sided CUSUM algorithm. The proposed decision statistic is based on a conditional likelihood ratio computed for each variable given the others. Our results show that this function allows to detect anomalies variable by variable, and thus to localise the variables involved in the anomalies more precisely than univariate methods based on simple marginals."}

{"text": "  This paper primarily addresses a dataset relating to cellular, chemical and physical conditions of patients gathered at the time they are operated upon to remove colorectal tumours. This data provides a unique insight into the biochemical and immunological status of patients at the point of tumour removal along with information about tumour classification and post-operative survival. The relationship between severity of tumour, based on TNM staging, and survival is still unclear for patients with TNM stage 2 and 3 tumours. We ask whether it is possible to predict survival rate more accurately using a selection of machine learning techniques applied to subsets of data to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between a patient's biochemical markers and survival. We use a range of feature selection and single classification techniques to predict the 5 year survival rate of TNM stage 2 and 3 patients which initially produces less than ideal results. The performance of each model individually is then compared with subsets of the data where agreement is reached for multiple models. This novel method of selective ensembling demonstrates that significant improvements in model accuracy on an unseen test set can be achieved for patients where agreement between models is achieved. Finally we point at a possible method to identify whether a patients prognosis can be accurately predicted or not."}
{"text": "  We introduce two practical properties of hierarchical clustering methods for (possibly asymmetric) network data: excisiveness and linear scale preservation. The latter enforces imperviousness to change in units of measure whereas the former ensures local consistency of the clustering outcome. Algorithmically, excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational complexity by only clustering a data subset of interest while theoretically guaranteeing that the same hierarchical outcome would be observed when clustering the whole dataset. Moreover, we introduce the concept of representability, i.e. a generative model for describing clustering methods through the specification of their action on a collection of networks. We further show that, within a rich set of admissible methods, requiring representability is equivalent to requiring both excisiveness and linear scale preservation. Leveraging this equivalence, we show that all excisive and linear scale preserving methods can be factored into two steps: a transformation of the weights in the input network followed by the application of a canonical clustering method. Furthermore, their factorization can be used to show stability of excisive and linear scale preserving methods in the sense that a bounded perturbation in the input network entails a bounded perturbation in the clustering output."}
{"text": "  Handling imbalanced datasets is a challenging problem that if not treated correctly results in reduced classification performance. Imbalanced datasets are commonly handled using minority oversampling, whereas the SMOTE algorithm is a successful oversampling algorithm with numerous extensions. SMOTE extensions do not have a theoretical guarantee during training to work better than SMOTE and in many instances their performance is data dependent. In this paper we propose a novel extension to the SMOTE algorithm with a theoretical guarantee for improved classification performance. The proposed approach considers the classification performance of both the majority and minority classes. In the proposed approach CGMOS (Certainty Guided Minority OverSampling) new data points are added by considering certainty changes in the dataset. The paper provides a proof that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to work better than SMOTE for training data. Further experimental results on 30 real-world datasets show that CGMOS works better than existing algorithms when using 6 different classifiers."}
{"text": "  Most high-dimensional estimation and prediction methods propose to minimize a cost function (empirical risk) that is written as a sum of losses associated to each data point. In this paper we focus on the case of non-convex losses, which is practically important but still poorly understood. Classical empirical process theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting M-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently.   In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to study the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and their properties. We establish uniform convergence of the gradient and Hessian of the empirical risk to their population counterparts, as soon as the number of samples becomes larger than the number of unknown parameters (modulo logarithmic factors). Consequently, good properties of the population risk can be carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one correspondence of their stationary points. We demonstrate that in several problems such as non-convex binary classification, robust regression, and Gaussian mixture model, this result implies a complete characterization of the landscape of the empirical risk, and of the convergence properties of descent algorithms.   We extend our analysis to the very high-dimensional setting in which the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, and provide a characterization of the empirical risk landscape under a nearly information-theoretically minimal condition. Namely, if the number of samples exceeds the sparsity of the unknown parameters vector (modulo logarithmic factors), then a suitable uniform convergence result takes place. We apply this result to non-convex binary classification and robust regression in very high-dimension."}

The proposed e-DWSVR optimizes the minimum margin and the mean of functional margin simultaneously to tackle these two issues. In addition, we use both dual coordinate descent (CD) and averaged stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) strategies to make e-DWSVR scalable to large scale problems. We report promising results obtained by e-DWSVR in comparison with existing methods on several benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  The importance of sleep is paramount for maintaining physical, emotional and mental wellbeing. Though the relationship between sleep and physical activity is known to be important, it is not yet fully understood. The explosion in popularity of actigraphy and wearable devices, provides a unique opportunity to understand this relationship. Leveraging this information source requires new tools to be developed to facilitate data-driven research for sleep and activity patient-recommendations.   In this paper we explore the use of deep learning to build sleep quality prediction models based on actigraphy data. We first use deep learning as a pure model building device by performing human activity recognition (HAR) on raw sensor data, and using deep learning to build sleep prediction models. We compare the deep learning models with those build using classical approaches, i.e. logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and adaboost. Secondly, we employ the advantage of deep learning with its ability to handle high dimensional datasets. We explore several deep learning models on the raw wearable sensor output without performing HAR or any other feature extraction.   Our results show that using a convolutional neural network on the raw wearables output improves the predictive value of sleep quality from physical activity, by an additional 8% compared to state-of-the-art non-deep learning approaches, which itself shows a 15% improvement over current practice. Moreover, utilizing deep learning on raw data eliminates the need for data pre-processing and simplifies the overall workflow to analyze actigraphy data for sleep and physical activity research."}
{"text": "  We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a \\textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an \\textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling."}
{"text": "  The problem of extending a function $f$ defined on a training data $\\mathcal{C}$ on an unknown manifold $\\mathbb{X}$ to the entire manifold and a tubular neighborhood of this manifold is considered in this paper. For $\\mathbb{X}$ embedded in a high dimensional ambient Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^D$, a deep learning algorithm is developed for finding a local coordinate system for the manifold {\\bf without eigen--decomposition}, which reduces the problem to the classical problem of function approximation on a low dimensional cube. Deep nets (or multilayered neural networks) are proposed to accomplish this approximation scheme by using the training data. Our methods do not involve such optimization techniques as back--propagation, while assuring optimal (a priori) error bounds on the output in terms of the number of derivatives of the target function. In addition, these methods are universal, in that they do not require a prior knowledge of the smoothness of the target function, but adjust the accuracy of approximation locally and automatically, depending only upon the local smoothness of the target function. Our ideas are easily extended to solve both the pre--image problem and the out--of--sample extension problem, with a priori bounds on the growth of the function thus extended."}
{"text": "  From a machine learning point of view, identifying a subset of relevant features from a real data set can be useful to improve the results achieved by classification methods and to reduce their time and space complexity. To achieve this goal, feature selection methods are usually employed. These approaches assume that the data contains redundant or irrelevant attributes that can be eliminated. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to manage the optimization problem that is at the foundation of the Mutual Information feature selection methods. Furthermore, our novel approach is able to estimate automatically the number of dimensions to retain. The quality of our method is confirmed by the promising results achieved on standard real data sets."}
{"text": "  Matrix sketching is aimed at finding close approximations of a matrix by factors of much smaller dimensions, which has important applications in optimization and machine learning. Given a matrix A of size m by n, state-of-the-art randomized algorithms take O(m * n) time and space to obtain its low-rank decomposition. Although quite useful, the need to store or manipulate the entire matrix makes it a computational bottleneck for truly large and dense inputs. Can we sketch an m-by-n matrix in O(m + n) cost by accessing only a small fraction of its rows and columns, without knowing anything about the remaining data? In this paper, we propose the cascaded bilateral sampling (CABS) framework to solve this problem. We start from demonstrating how the approximation quality of bilateral matrix sketching depends on the encoding powers of sampling. In particular, the sampled rows and columns should correspond to the code-vectors in the ground truth decompositions. Motivated by this analysis, we propose to first generate a pilot-sketch using simple random sampling, and then pursue more advanced, \"follow-up\" sampling on the pilot-sketch factors seeking maximal encoding powers. In this cascading process, the rise of approximation quality is shown to be lower-bounded by the improvement of encoding powers in the follow-up sampling step, thus theoretically guarantees the algorithmic boosting property. Computationally, our framework only takes linear time and space, and at the same time its performance rivals the quality of state-of-the-art algorithms consuming a quadratic amount of resources. Empirical evaluations on benchmark data fully demonstrate the potential of our methods in large scale matrix sketching and related areas."}
{"text": "  Nearest neighbor has always been one of the most appealing non-parametric approaches in machine learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, etc. Previous empirical studies partly shows that nearest neighbor is resistant to noise, yet there is a lack of deep analysis. This work presents the finite-sample and distribution-dependent bounds on the consistency of nearest neighbor in the random noise setting. The theoretical results show that, for asymmetric noises, k-nearest neighbor is robust enough to classify most data correctly, except for a handful of examples, whose labels are totally misled by random noises. For symmetric noises, however, k-nearest neighbor achieves the same consistent rate as that of noise-free setting, which verifies the resistance of k-nearest neighbor to random noisy labels. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose the Robust k-Nearest Neighbor (RkNN) approach to deal with noisy labels. The basic idea is to make unilateral corrections to examples, whose labels are totally misled by random noises, and classify the others directly by utilizing the robustness of k-nearest neighbor. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm both theoretically and empirically."}
{"text": "  Mixture models with Gamma and or inverse-Gamma distributed mixture components are useful for medical image tissue segmentation or as post-hoc models for regression coefficients obtained from linear regression within a Generalised Linear Modeling framework (GLM), used in this case to separate stochastic (Gaussian) noise from some kind of positive or negative \"activation\" (modeled as Gamma or inverse-Gamma distributed). To date, the most common choice in this context it is Gaussian/Gamma mixture models learned through a maximum likelihood (ML) approach; we recently extended such algorithm for mixture models with inverse-Gamma components. Here, we introduce a fully analytical Variational Bayes (VB) learning framework for both Gamma and/or inverse-Gamma components. We use synthetic and resting state fMRI data to compare the performance of the ML and VB algorithms in terms of area under the curve and computational cost. We observed that the ML Gaussian/Gamma model is very expensive specially when considering high resolution images; furthermore, these solutions are highly variable and they occasionally can overestimate the activations severely. The Bayesian Gauss-Gamma is in general the fastest algorithm but provides too dense solutions. The maximum likelihood Gaussian/inverse-Gamma is also very fast but provides in general very sparse solutions. The variational Gaussian/inverse-Gamma mixture model is the most robust and its cost is acceptable even for high resolution images. Further, the presented methodology represents an essential building block that can be directly used in more complex inference tasks, specially designed to analyse MRI-fMRI data; such models include for example analytical variational mixture models with adaptive spatial regularization or better source models for new spatial blind source separation approaches."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present the design of error-resilient machine learning architectures by employing a distributed machine learning framework referred to as classifier ensemble (CE). CE combines several simple classifiers to obtain a strong one. In contrast, centralized machine learning employs a single complex block. We compare the random forest (RF) and the support vector machine (SVM), which are representative techniques from the CE and centralized frameworks, respectively. Employing the dataset from UCI machine learning repository and architectural-level error models in a commercial 45 nm CMOS process, it is demonstrated that RF-based architectures are significantly more robust than SVM architectures in presence of timing errors due to process variations in near-threshold voltage (NTV) regions (0.3 V - 0.7 V). In particular, the RF architecture exhibits a detection accuracy (P_{det}) that varies by 3.2% while maintaining a median P_{det} > 0.9 at a gate level delay variation of 28.9% . In comparison, SVM exhibits a P_{det} that varies by 16.8%. Additionally, we propose an error weighted voting technique that incorporates the timing error statistics of the NTV circuit fabric to further enhance robustness. Simulation results confirm that the error weighted voting achieves a P_{det} that varies by only 1.4%, which is 12X lower compared to SVM."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make diagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an intuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms. These drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data and make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world patient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels. Next, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model (IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen discomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by using mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results show reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort drawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM given a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The positive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be used for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support system for physicians and other health care personnel."}
{"text": "  Preterm births occur at an alarming rate of 10-15%. Preemies have a higher risk of infant mortality, developmental retardation and long-term disabilities. Predicting preterm birth is difficult, even for the most experienced clinicians. The most well-designed clinical study thus far reaches a modest sensitivity of 18.2-24.2% at specificity of 28.6-33.3%. We take a different approach by exploiting databases of normal hospital operations. We aims are twofold: (i) to derive an easy-to-use, interpretable prediction rule with quantified uncertainties, and (ii) to construct accurate classifiers for preterm birth prediction. Our approach is to automatically generate and select from hundreds (if not thousands) of possible predictors using stability-aware techniques. Derived from a large database of 15,814 women, our simplified prediction rule with only 10 items has sensitivity of 62.3% at specificity of 81.5%."}
{"text": "  We here introduce a novel classification approach adopted from the nonlinear model identification framework, which jointly addresses the feature selection and classifier design tasks. The classifier is constructed as a polynomial expansion of the original attributes and a model structure selection process is applied to find the relevant terms of the model. The selection method progressively refines a probability distribution defined on the model structure space, by extracting sample models from the current distribution and using the aggregate information obtained from the evaluation of the population of models to reinforce the probability of extracting the most important terms. To reduce the initial search space, distance correlation filtering can be applied as a preprocessing technique. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other well-known feature selection and classification methods on standard benchmark classification problems. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to competitor methods both in terms of classification accuracy and model complexity. The obtained models have a simple structure, easily amenable to interpretation and analysis."}
{"text": "  We prove a central limit theorem for the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to the $d$ largest eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix of a finite dimensional random dot product graph. As a corollary, we show that for stochastic blockmodel graphs, the rows of the spectral embedding of the normalized Laplacian converge to multivariate normals and furthermore the mean and the covariance matrix of each row are functions of the associated vertex's block membership. Together with prior results for the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, we then compare, via the Chernoff information between multivariate normal distributions, how the choice of embedding method impacts subsequent inference. We demonstrate that neither embedding method dominates with respect to the inference task of recovering the latent block assignments."}

More specifically we are interested in modelling the effect of a widely used anaesthetic drug (Propofol) on a patient's monitored depth of anaesthesia and haemodynamics. We compare our approach with one from the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) literature and show that we can provide significant improvements in performance without requiring the incorporation of expert physiological knowledge in our system."}
{"text": "  Nonlinear similarity measures defined in kernel space, such as correntropy, can extract higher-order statistics of data and offer potentially significant performance improvement over their linear counterparts especially in non-Gaussian signal processing and machine learning. In this work, we propose a new similarity measure in kernel space, called the kernel risk-sensitive loss (KRSL), and provide some important properties. We apply the KRSL to adaptive filtering and investigate the robustness, and then develop the MKRSL algorithm and analyze the mean square convergence performance. Compared with correntropy, the KRSL can offer a more efficient performance surface, thereby enabling a gradient based method to achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy while still maintaining the robustness to outliers. Theoretical analysis results and superior performance of the new algorithm are confirmed by simulation."}
{"text": "  Disparate areas of machine learning have benefited from models that can take raw data with little preprocessing as input and learn rich representations of that raw data in order to perform well on a given prediction task. We evaluate this approach in healthcare by using longitudinal measurements of lab tests, one of the more raw signals of a patient's health state widely available in clinical data, to predict disease onsets. In particular, we train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and two novel convolutional neural networks for multi-task prediction of disease onset for 133 conditions based on 18 common lab tests measured over time in a cohort of 298K patients derived from 8 years of administrative claims data. We compare the neural networks to a logistic regression with several hand-engineered, clinically relevant features. We find that the representation-based learning approaches significantly outperform this baseline. We believe that our work suggests a new avenue for patient risk stratification based solely on lab results."}
{"text": "  An important task in network analysis is the detection of anomalous events in a network time series. These events could merely be times of interest in the network timeline or they could be examples of malicious activity or network malfunction. Hypothesis testing using network statistics to summarize the behavior of the network provides a robust framework for the anomaly detection decision process. Unfortunately, choosing network statistics that are dependent on confounding factors like the total number of nodes or edges can lead to incorrect conclusions (e.g., false positives and false negatives). In this dissertation we describe the challenges that face anomaly detection in dynamic network streams regarding confounding factors. We also provide two solutions to avoiding error due to confounding factors: the first is a randomization testing method that controls for confounding factors, and the second is a set of size-consistent network statistics which avoid confounding due to the most common factors, edge count and node count."}
{"text": "  Accurate subtyping of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is of crucial importance for understanding disease progression and for making informed treatment decisions. New discoveries of significant alterations to mitochondria between subtypes make immunohistochemical (IHC) staining based image classification an imperative. Until now, accurate quantification and subtyping was made impossible by huge IHC variations, the absence of cell membrane staining for cytoplasm segmentation as well as the complete lack of systems for robust and reproducible image based classification. In this paper we present a comprehensive classification framework to overcome these challenges for tissue microarrays (TMA) of RCCs. We compare and evaluate models based on domain specific hand-crafted \"flat\"-features versus \"deep\" feature representations from various layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The best model reaches a cross-validation accuracy of 89%, which demonstrates for the first time, that robust mitochondria-based subtyping of renal cancer is feasible"}
{"text": "  We study probability measures induced by set functions with constraints. Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds."}
{"text": "  The existence of large volumes of time series data in many applications has motivated data miners to investigate specialized methods for mining time series data. Clustering is a popular data mining method due to its powerful exploratory nature and its usefulness as a preprocessing step for other data mining techniques. This article develops two novel clustering algorithms for time series data that are extensions of a crisp c-shapes algorithm. The two new algorithms are heuristic derivatives of fuzzy c-means (FCM). Fuzzy c-Shapes plus (FCS+) replaces the inner product norm in the FCM model with a shape-based distance function. Fuzzy c-Shapes double plus (FCS++) uses the shape-based distance, and also replaces the FCM cluster centers with shape-extracted prototypes. Numerical experiments on 48 real time series data sets show that the two new algorithms outperform state-of-the-art shape-based clustering algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Four external cluster validity indices (the Rand index, Adjusted Rand Index, Variation of Information, and Normalized Mutual Information) are used to match candidate partitions generated by each of the studied algorithms. All four indices agree that for these finite waveform data sets, FCS++ gives a small improvement over FCS+, and in turn, FCS+ is better than the original crisp c-shapes method. Finally, we apply two tests of statistical significance to the three algorithms. The Wilcoxon and Friedman statistics both rank the three algorithms in exactly the same way as the four cluster validity indices."}
{"text": "  Support vector clustering (SVC) is a versatile clustering technique that is able to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes by exploiting the kernel trick. However, one hurdle that restricts the application of SVC lies in its sensitivity to the kernel parameter and the trade-off parameter. Although many extensions of SVC have been developed, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no algorithm that is able to effectively estimate the two crucial parameters in SVC without supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel support vector clustering approach termed ensemble-driven support vector clustering (EDSVC), which for the first time tackles the automatic parameter estimation problem for SVC based on ensemble learning, and is capable of producing robust clustering results in a purely unsupervised manner. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of demixing a pair of sparse signals from noisy, nonlinear observations of their superposition. Mathematically, we consider a nonlinear signal observation model, $y_i = g(a_i^Tx) + e_i, \\ i=1,\\ldots,m$, where $x = \\Phi w+\\Psi z$ denotes the superposition signal, $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ are orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and $w, z\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ are sparse coefficient vectors of the constituent signals, and $e_i$ represents the noise. Moreover, $g$ represents a nonlinear link function, and $a_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $i$-th row of the measurement matrix, $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$. Problems of this nature arise in several applications ranging from astronomy, computer vision, and machine learning. In this paper, we make some concrete algorithmic progress for the above demixing problem. Specifically, we consider two scenarios: (i) the case when the demixing procedure has no knowledge of the link function, and (ii) the case when the demixing algorithm has perfect knowledge of the link function. In both cases, we provide fast algorithms for recovery of the constituents $w$ and $z$ from the observations. Moreover, we support these algorithms with a rigorous theoretical analysis, and derive (nearly) tight upper bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms for achieving stable recovery of the component signals. We also provide a range of numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms on both real and synthetic signals and images."}
{"text": "  A genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlates marker variation with trait variation in a sample of individuals. Each study subject is genotyped at a multitude of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) spanning the genome. Here we assume that subjects are unrelated and collected at random and that trait values are normally distributed or transformed to normality. Over the past decade, researchers have been remarkably successful in applying GWAS analysis to hundreds of traits. The massive amount of data produced in these studies present unique computational challenges. Penalized regression with LASSO or MCP penalties is capable of selecting a handful of associated SNPs from millions of potential SNPs. Unfortunately, model selection can be corrupted by false positives and false negatives, obscuring the genetic underpinning of a trait. This paper introduces the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm to the GWAS analysis of continuous traits. Our parallel implementation of IHT accommodates SNP genotype compression and exploits multiple CPU cores and graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows statistical geneticists to leverage commodity desktop computers in GWAS analysis and to avoid supercomputing. We evaluate IHT performance on both simulated and real GWAS data and conclude that it reduces false positive and false negative rates while remaining competitive in computational time with penalized regression.

{"text": "  Multiview assisted learning has gained significant attention in recent years in supervised learning genre. Availability of high performance computing devices enables learning algorithms to search simultaneously over multiple views or feature spaces to obtain an optimum classification performance. The paper is a pioneering attempt of formulating a mathematical foundation for realizing a multiview aided collaborative boosting architecture for multiclass classification. Most of the present algorithms apply multiview learning heuristically without exploring the fundamental mathematical changes imposed on traditional boosting. Also, most of the algorithms are restricted to two class or view setting. Our proposed mathematical framework enables collaborative boosting across any finite dimensional view spaces for multiclass learning. The boosting framework is based on forward stagewise additive model which minimizes a novel exponential loss function. We show that the exponential loss function essentially captures difficulty of a training sample space instead of the traditional `1/0' loss. The new algorithm restricts a weak view from over learning and thereby preventing overfitting. The model is inspired by our earlier attempt on collaborative boosting which was devoid of mathematical justification. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge much nearer to global minimum in the exponential loss space and thus supersedes our previous algorithm. The paper also presents analytical and numerical analysis of convergence and margin bounds for multiview boosting algorithms and we show that our proposed ensemble learning manifests lower error bound and higher margin compared to our previous model. Also, the proposed model is compared with traditional boosting and recent multiview boosting algorithms."}
{"text": "  Kernel machines often yield superior predictive performance on various tasks; however, they suffer from severe computational challenges. In this paper, we show how to overcome the important challenge of speeding up kernel machines. In particular, we develop a parallel block minimization framework for solving kernel machines, including kernel SVM and kernel logistic regression. Our framework proceeds by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems by forming a block-diagonal approximation of the Hessian matrix. The subproblems are then solved approximately in parallel. After that, a communication efficient line search procedure is developed to ensure sufficient reduction of the objective function value at each iteration. We prove global linear convergence rate of the proposed method with a wide class of subproblem solvers, and our analysis covers strongly convex and some non-strongly convex functions. We apply our algorithm to solve large-scale kernel SVM problems on distributed systems, and show a significant improvement over existing parallel solvers. As an example, on the covtype dataset with half-a-million samples, our algorithm can obtain an approximate solution with 96% accuracy in 20 seconds using 32 machines, while all the other parallel kernel SVM solvers require more than 2000 seconds to achieve a solution with 95% accuracy. Moreover, our algorithm can scale to very large data sets, such as the kdd algebra dataset with 8 million samples and 20 million features."}

{"text": "  Recently, a general method for analyzing the statistical accuracy of the EM algorithm has been developed and applied to some simple latent variable models [Balakrishnan et al. 2016]. In that method, the basin of attraction for valid initialization is required to be a ball around the truth. Using Stein's Lemma, we extend these results in the case of estimating the centers of a two-component Gaussian mixture in $d$ dimensions. In particular, we significantly expand the basin of attraction to be the intersection of a half space and a ball around the origin. If the signal-to-noise ratio is at least a constant multiple of $ \\sqrt{d\\log d} $, we show that a random initialization strategy is feasible."}
{"text": "  Voice disorders affect an estimated 14 million working-aged Americans, and many more worldwide. We present the first large scale study of vocal misuse based on long-term ambulatory data collected by an accelerometer placed on the neck. We investigate an unsupervised data mining approach to uncovering latent information about voice misuse.   We segment signals from over 253 days of data from 22 subjects into over a hundred million single glottal pulses (closures of the vocal folds), cluster segments into symbols, and use symbolic mismatch to uncover differences between patients and matched controls, and between patients pre- and post-treatment. Our results show significant behavioral differences between patients and controls, as well as between some pre- and post-treatment patients. Our proposed approach provides an objective basis for helping diagnose behavioral voice disorders, and is a first step towards a more data-driven understanding of the impact of voice therapy."}

{"text": "  Boosting combines weak (biased) learners to obtain effective learning algorithms for classification and prediction. In this paper, we show a connection between boosting and kernel-based methods, highlighting both theoretical and practical applications. In the context of $\\ell_2$ boosting, we start with a weak linear learner defined by a kernel $K$. We show that boosting with this learner is equivalent to estimation with a special {\\it boosting kernel} that depends on $K$, as well as on the regression matrix, noise variance, and hyperparameters. The number of boosting iterations is modeled as a continuous hyperparameter, and fit along with other parameters using standard techniques.   We then generalize the boosting kernel to a broad new class of boosting approaches for more general weak learners, including those based on the $\\ell_1$, hinge and Vapnik losses. The approach allows fast hyperparameter tuning for this general class, and has a wide range of applications, including robust regression and classification. We illustrate some of these applications with numerical examples on synthetic and real data."}
{"text": "  The prediction plays the important role in detecting efficient protection and therapy of cancer. The prediction of mutations in gene needs a diagnostic and classification, which is based on the whole database (big dataset), to reach sufficient accuracy results. Since the tumor suppressor P53 is approximately about fifty percentage of all human tumors because mutations that occur in the TP53 gene into the cells. So, this paper is applied on tumor p53, where the problem is there are several primitive databases (excel database) contain datasets of TP53 gene with its tumor protein p53, these databases are rich datasets that cover all mutations and cause diseases (cancers). But these Data Bases cannot reach to predict and diagnosis cancers, i.e. the big datasets have not efficient Data Mining method, which can predict, diagnosis the mutation, and classify the cancer of patient. The goal of this paper to reach a Data Mining technique, that employs neural network, which bases on the big datasets. Also, offers friendly predictions, flexible, and effective classified cancers, in order to overcome the previous techniques drawbacks. This proposed technique is done by using two approaches, first, bioinformatics techniques by using BLAST, CLUSTALW, etc, in order to know if there are malignant mutations or not. The second, data mining by using neural network; it is selected (12) out of (53) TP53 gene database fields. To clarify, one of these 12 fields (gene location field) did not exists in TP53 gene database; therefore, it is added to the database of TP53 gene in training and testing back propagation algorithm, in order to classify specifically the types of cancers. Feed Forward Back Propagation supports this Data Mining method with data training rate (1) and Mean Square Error (MSE) (0.00000000000001). This effective technique allows in a quick, accurate and easy way to classify the type of cancer."}

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed algorithm requires no message passing procedure among latent variables and can be distributed to a network of computers to speed up learning. Our experiments corroborate that the proposed algorithm does not introduce further approximation bias compared to the proven structured mean-field algorithm, and achieves better performance with long sequences and large FHMMs."}
{"text": "  Recently, there has been a growing research interest in the analysis of dynamic regret, which measures the performance of an online learner against a sequence of local minimizers. By exploiting the strong convexity, previous studies have shown that the dynamic regret can be upper bounded by the path-length of the comparator sequence. In this paper, we illustrate that the dynamic regret can be further improved by allowing the learner to query the gradient of the function multiple times, and meanwhile the strong convexity can be weakened to other non-degenerate conditions. Specifically, we introduce the squared path-length, which could be much smaller than the path-length, as a new regularity of the comparator sequence. When multiple gradients are accessible to the learner, we first demonstrate that the dynamic regret of strongly convex functions can be upper bounded by the minimum of the path-length and the squared path-length. We then extend our theoretical guarantee to functions that are semi-strongly convex or self-concordant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that semi-strong convexity and self-concordance are utilized to tighten the dynamic regret."}
{"text": "  Machine learning methods are used to discover complex nonlinear relationships in biological and medical data. However, sophisticated learning models are computationally unfeasible for data with millions of features. Here we introduce the first feature selection method for nonlinear learning problems that can scale up to large, ultra-high dimensional biological data. More specifically, we scale up the novel Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion Lasso (HSIC Lasso) to handle millions of features with tens of thousand samples. The proposed method is guaranteed to find an optimal subset of maximally predictive features with minimal redundancy, yielding higher predictive power and improved interpretability. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through applications to classify phenotypes based on module expression in human prostate cancer patients and to detect enzymes among protein structures. We achieve high accuracy with as few as 20 out of one million features --- a dimensionality reduction of 99.998%. Our algorithm can be implemented on commodity cloud computing platforms. The dramatic reduction of features may lead to the ubiquitous deployment of sophisticated prediction models in mobile health care applications."}

The text generation can be conducted by either the teacher or the student network. We can also improve the performance by taking the ensemble of soft labels obtained from multiple teacher networks. This method can be used for privacy conscious language model adaptation because no user data is directly used for training. Especially, when the soft labels of multiple devices are aggregated via a trusted third party, we can expect very strong privacy protection."}
{"text": "  This paper considers \\emph{volume minimization} (VolMin)-based structured matrix factorization (SMF). VolMin is a factorization criterion that decomposes a given data matrix into a basis matrix times a structured coefficient matrix via finding the minimum-volume simplex that encloses all the columns of the data matrix. Recent work showed that VolMin guarantees the identifiability of the factor matrices under mild conditions that are realistic in a wide variety of applications. This paper focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of VolMin. On the theory side, exact equivalence of two independently developed sufficient conditions for VolMin identifiability is proven here, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of this aspect of VolMin. On the algorithm side, computational complexity and sensitivity to outliers are two key challenges associated with real-world applications of VolMin. These are addressed here via a new VolMin algorithm that handles volume regularization in a computationally simple way, and automatically detects and {iteratively downweights} outliers, simultaneously. Simulations and real-data experiments using a remotely sensed hyperspectral image and the Reuters document corpus are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  A recent goal in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework is to choose a sequence of actions or a policy to maximize the reward collected or minimize the regret incurred in a finite time horizon. For several RL problems in operation research and optimal control, the optimal policy of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) is characterized by a known structure. The current state of the art algorithms do not utilize this known structure of the optimal policy while minimizing regret. In this work, we develop new RL algorithms that exploit the structure of the optimal policy to minimize regret. Numerical experiments on MDPs with structured optimal policies show that our algorithms have better performance, are easy to implement, have a smaller run-time and require less number of random number generations."}

{"text": "  This paper describes a number of fundamental and practical problems in the application of hidden-Markov models and Bayes when applied to cursive-script recognition. Several problems, however, will have an effect in other application areas. The most fundamental problem is the propagation of error in the product of probabilities. This is a common and pervasive problem which deserves more attention. On the basis of Monte Carlo modeling, tables for the expected relative error are given. It seems that it is distributed according to a continuous Poisson distribution over log probabilities. A second essential problem is related to the appropriateness of the Markov assumption. Basic tests will reveal whether a problem requires modeling of the stochastics of seriality, at all. Examples are given of lexical encodings which cover 95-99% classification accuracy of a lexicon, with removed sequence information, for several European languages. Finally, a summary of results on a non- Bayes, non-Markov method in handwriting recognition are presented, with very acceptable results and minimal modeling or training requirements using nearest-mean classification."}
{"text": "  Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass -- amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a framework for computing random operator-valued feature maps for operator-valued positive definite kernels. This is a generalization of the random Fourier features for scalar-valued kernels to the operator-valued case. Our general setting is that of operator-valued kernels corresponding to RKHS of functions with values in a Hilbert space. We show that in general, for a given kernel, there are potentially infinitely many random feature maps, which can be bounded or unbounded. Most importantly, given a kernel, we present a general, closed form formula for computing a corresponding probability measure, which is required for the construction of the Fourier features, and which, unlike the scalar case, is not uniquely and automatically determined by the kernel. We also show that, under appropriate conditions, random bounded feature maps can always be computed. Furthermore, we show the uniform convergence, under the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, of the resulting approximate kernel to the exact kernel on any compact subset of Euclidean space. Our convergence requires differentiable kernels, an improvement over the twice-differentiability requirement in previous work in the scalar setting. We then show how operator-valued feature maps and their approximations can be employed in a general vector-valued learning framework. The mathematical formulation is illustrated by numerical examples on matrix-valued kernels."}

It is highly significant how to design the seismic data acquisition survey and locate the exploratory wells since incorrect or imprecise locations lead to waste of time and money during the operation. The objective of this study is to locate high-potential oil and gas field in 1: 250,000 sheet of Ahwaz including 20 oil fields to reduce both time and costs in exploration and production processes. In this regard, 17 maps were developed using GIS functions for factors including: minimum and maximum of total organic carbon (TOC), yield potential for hydrocarbons production (PP), Tmax peak, production index (PI), oxygen index (OI), hydrogen index (HI) as well as presence or proximity to high residual Bouguer gravity anomalies, proximity to anticline axis and faults, topography and curvature maps obtained from Asmari Formation subsurface contours. To model and to integrate maps, this study employed artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The results obtained from model validation demonstrated that the 17x10x5 neural network with R=0.8948, RMS=0.0267, and kappa=0.9079 can be trained better than other models such as ANFIS and predicts the potential areas more accurately.

{"text": "  We consider two settings of online learning to rank where feedback is restricted to top ranked items. The problem is cast as an online game between a learner and sequence of users, over $T$ rounds. In both settings, the learners objective is to present ranked list of items to the users. The learner's performance is judged on the entire ranked list and true relevances of the items. However, the learner receives highly restricted feedback at end of each round, in form of relevances of only the top $k$ ranked items, where $k \\ll m$. The first setting is \\emph{non-contextual}, where the list of items to be ranked is fixed. The second setting is \\emph{contextual}, where lists of items vary, in form of traditional query-document lists. No stochastic assumption is made on the generation process of relevances of items and contexts. We provide efficient ranking strategies for both the settings. The strategies achieve $O(T^{2/3})$ regret, where regret is based on popular ranking measures in first setting and ranking surrogates in second setting. We also provide impossibility results for certain ranking measures and a certain class of surrogates, when feedback is restricted to the top ranked item, i.e. $k=1$. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on simulated and real world datasets."}

Hardware architects have responded by proposing a wide array of promising ideas, but to date, the majority of the work has focused on specific algorithms in somewhat narrow application domains. While their specificity does not diminish these approaches, there is a clear need for more flexible solutions. We believe the first step is to examine the characteristics of cutting edge models from across the deep learning community.   Consequently, we have assembled Fathom: a collection of eight archetypal deep learning workloads for study. Each of these models comes from a seminal work in the deep learning community, ranging from the familiar deep convolutional neural network of Krizhevsky et al., to the more exotic memory networks from Facebook's AI research group. Fathom has been released online, and this paper focuses on understanding the fundamental performance characteristics of each model. We use a set of application-level modeling tools built around the TensorFlow deep learning framework in order to analyze the behavior of the Fathom workloads. We present a breakdown of where time is spent, the similarities between the performance profiles of our models, an analysis of behavior in inference and training, and the effects of parallelism on scaling."}
{"text": "  We develop a new statistical machine learning paradigm, named infinite-label learning, to annotate a data point with more than one relevant labels from a candidate set, which pools both the finite labels observed at training and a potentially infinite number of previously unseen labels. The infinite-label learning fundamentally expands the scope of conventional multi-label learning, and better models the practical requirements in various real-world applications, such as image tagging, ads-query association, and article categorization. However, how can we learn a labeling function that is capable of assigning to a data point the labels omitted from the training set? To answer the question, we seek some clues from the recent work on zero-shot learning, where the key is to represent a class/label by a vector of semantic codes, as opposed to treating them as atomic labels. We validate the infinite-label learning by a PAC bound in theory and some empirical studies on both synthetic and real data."}
{"text": "  The Kalman filter (KF) is used in a variety of applications for computing the posterior distribution of latent states in a state space model. The model requires a linear relationship between states and observations. Extensions to the Kalman filter have been proposed that incorporate linear approximations to nonlinear models, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). However, we argue that in cases where the dimensionality of observed variables greatly exceeds the dimensionality of state variables, a model for $p(\\text{state}|\\text{observation})$ proves both easier to learn and more accurate for latent space estimation. We derive and validate what we call the discriminative Kalman filter (DKF): a closed-form discriminative version of Bayesian filtering that readily incorporates off-the-shelf discriminative learning techniques. Further, we demonstrate that given mild assumptions, highly non-linear models for $p(\\text{state}|\\text{observation})$ can be specified. We motivate and validate on synthetic datasets and in neural decoding from non-human primates, showing substantial increases in decoding performance versus the standard Kalman filter."}
{"text": "  Positive unlabeled (PU) learning is useful in various practical situations, where there is a need to learn a classifier for a class of interest from an unlabeled data set, which may contain anomalies as well as samples from unknown classes. The learning task can be formulated as an optimization problem under the framework of statistical learning theory. Recent studies have theoretically analyzed its properties and generalization performance, nevertheless, little effort has been made to consider the problem of scalability, especially when large sets of unlabeled data are available. In this work we propose a novel scalable PU learning algorithm that is theoretically proven to provide the optimal solution, while showing superior computational and memory performance. Experimental evaluation confirms the theoretical evidence and shows that the proposed method can be successfully applied to a large variety of real-world problems involving PU learning."}
{"text": "  Solving optimal design problems through crowdsourcing faces a dilemma: On one hand, human beings have been shown to be more effective than algorithms at searching for good solutions of certain real-world problems with high-dimensional or discrete solution spaces; on the other hand, the cost of setting up crowdsourcing environments, the uncertainty in the crowd's domain-specific competence, and the lack of commitment of the crowd, all contribute to the lack of real-world application of design crowdsourcing. We are thus motivated to investigate a solution-searching mechanism where an optimization algorithm is tuned based on human demonstrations on solution searching, so that the search can be continued after human participants abandon the problem. To do so, we model the iterative search process as a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, and propose an inverse BO (IBO) algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimators of the BO parameters based on human solutions. We show through a vehicle design and control problem that the search performance of BO can be improved by recovering its parameters based on an effective human search. Thus, IBO has the potential to improve the success rate of design crowdsourcing activities, by requiring only good search strategies instead of good solutions from the crowd."}

The concepts identified among these species together provide rules-of-thumb about the intrinsic biological features of rodents that carry zoonotic diseases, and offer utility for better targeting field surveillance efforts in the search for novel disease carriers in the wild."}
{"text": "  We improve current instability-based methods for the selection of the number of clusters $k$ in cluster analysis by developing a normalized cluster instability measure that corrects for the distribution of cluster sizes, a previously unaccounted driver of cluster instability. We show that our normalized instability measure outperforms current instability-based measures across the whole sequence of possible $k$ and especially overcomes limitations in the context of large $k$. We also compare, for the first time, model-based and model-free approaches to determine cluster-instability and find their performance to be comparable. We make our method available in the R-package \\verb+cstab+."}
{"text": "  The unscented transformation (UT) is an efficient method to solve the state estimation problem for a non-linear dynamic system, utilizing a derivative-free higher-order approximation by approximating a Gaussian distribution rather than approximating a non-linear function. Applying the UT to a Kalman filter type estimator leads to the well-known unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Although the UKF works very well in Gaussian noises, its performance may deteriorate significantly when the noises are non-Gaussian, especially when the system is disturbed by some heavy-tailed impulsive noises. To improve the robustness of the UKF against impulsive noises, a new filter for nonlinear systems is proposed in this work, namely the maximum correntropy unscented filter (MCUF). In MCUF, the UT is applied to obtain the prior estimates of the state and covariance matrix, and a robust statistical linearization regression based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is then used to obtain the posterior estimates of the state and covariance. The satisfying performance of the new algorithm is confirmed by two illustrative examples."}
{"text": "  Kernel-based K-means clustering has gained popularity due to its simplicity and the power of its implicit non-linear representation of the data. A dominant concern is the memory requirement since memory scales as the square of the number of data points. We provide a new analysis of a class of approximate kernel methods that have more modest memory requirements, and propose a specific one-pass randomized kernel approximation followed by standard K-means on the transformed data. The analysis and experiments suggest the method is accurate, while requiring drastically less memory than standard kernel K-means and significantly less memory than Nystrom based approximations."}
{"text": "  In this short paper, we propose the split-diffuse (SD) algorithm that takes the output of an existing word embedding algorithm, and distributes the data points uniformly across the visualization space. The result improves the perceivability and the interactability by the human.   We apply the SD algorithm to analyze the user behavior through access logs within the cyber security domain. The result, named the topic grids, is a set of grids on various topics generated from the logs. On the same set of grids, different behavioral metrics can be shown on different targets over different periods of time, to provide visualization and interaction to the human experts.   Analysis, investigation, and other types of interaction can be performed on the topic grids more efficiently than on the output of existing dimension reduction methods. In addition to the cyber security domain, the topic grids can be further applied to other domains like e-commerce, credit card transaction, customer service to analyze the behavior in a large scale."}

{"text": "  Deep learning techniques have been paramount in the last years, mainly due to their outstanding results in a number of applications, that range from speech recognition to face-based user identification. Despite other techniques employed for such purposes, Deep Boltzmann Machines are among the most used ones, which are composed of layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) stacked on top of each other. In this work, we evaluate the concept of temperature in DBMs, which play a key role in Boltzmann-related distributions, but it has never been considered in this context up to date. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to take into account this information and to evaluate its influence in DBMs considering the task of binary image reconstruction. We expect this work can foster future research considering the usage of different temperatures during learning in DBMs."}
{"text": "  Manifold Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been introduced to sample more effectively from challenging target densities exhibiting multiple modes or strong correlations. Such algorithms exploit the local geometry of the parameter space, thus enabling chains to achieve a faster convergence rate when measured in number of steps. However, acquiring local geometric information can often increase computational complexity per step to the extent that sampling from high-dimensional targets becomes inefficient in terms of total computational time. This paper analyzes the computational complexity of manifold Langevin Monte Carlo and proposes a geometric adaptive Monte Carlo sampler aimed at balancing the benefits of exploiting local geometry with computational cost to achieve a high effective sample size for a given computational cost. The suggested sampler is a discrete-time stochastic process in random environment. The random environment allows to switch between local geometric and adaptive proposal kernels with the help of a schedule. An exponential schedule is put forward that enables more frequent use of geometric information in early transient phases of the chain, while saving computational time in late stationary phases. The average complexity can be manually set depending on the need for geometric exploitation posed by the underlying model."}
{"text": "  An incremental/online state dynamic learning method is proposed for identification of the nonlinear Gaussian state space models. The method embeds the stochastic variational sparse Gaussian process as the probabilistic state dynamic model inside a particle filter framework. Model updating is done at measurement sample rate using stochastic gradient descent based optimization implemented in the state estimation filtering loop. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian process based batch learning methods. Finally, it is shown that the state estimation performance significantly improves due to the online learning of state dynamics."}
{"text": "  Gaussian graphical models are widely used to represent conditional dependence among random variables. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for data arising from a group of Gaussian graphical models that are themselves dependent. A motivating example is that of modeling gene expression collected on multiple tissues from the same individual: here the multivariate outcome is affected by dependencies acting not only at the level of the specific tissues, but also at the level of the whole body; existing methods that assume independence among graphs are not applicable in this case. To estimate multiple dependent graphs, we decompose the problem into two graphical layers: the systemic layer, which affects all outcomes and thereby induces cross- graph dependence, and the category-specific layer, which represents graph-specific variation. We propose a graphical EM technique that estimates both layers jointly, establish estimation consistency and selection sparsistency of the proposed estimator, and confirm by simulation that the EM method is superior to a simple one-step method. We apply our technique to mouse genomics data and obtain biologically plausible results."}
{"text": "  A key problem in structured output prediction is direct optimization of the task reward function that matters for test evaluation. This paper presents a simple and computationally efficient approach to incorporate task reward into a maximum likelihood framework. By establishing a link between the log-likelihood and expected reward objectives, we show that an optimal regularized expected reward is achieved when the conditional distribution of the outputs given the inputs is proportional to their exponentiated scaled rewards. Accordingly, we present a framework to smooth the predictive probability of the outputs using their corresponding rewards. We optimize the conditional log-probability of augmented outputs that are sampled proportionally to their exponentiated scaled rewards. Experiments on neural sequence to sequence models for speech recognition and machine translation show notable improvements over a maximum likelihood baseline by using reward augmented maximum likelihood (RAML), where the rewards are defined as the negative edit distance between the outputs and the ground truth labels."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we model the trajectory of sea vessels and provide a service that predicts in near-real time the position of any given vessel in 4', 10', 20' and 40' time intervals. We explore the necessary tradeoffs between accuracy, performance and resource utilization are explored given the large volume and update rates of input data. We start with building models based on well-established machine learning algorithms using static datasets and multi-scan training approaches and identify the best candidate to be used in implementing a single-pass predictive approach, under real-time constraints. The results are measured in terms of accuracy and performance and are compared against the baseline kinematic equations. Results show that it is possible to efficiently model the trajectory of multiple vessels using a single model, which is trained and evaluated using an adequately large, static dataset, thus achieving a significant gain in terms of resource usage while not compromising accuracy."}
{"text": "  Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, that are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). However, these methods don't exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks was proposed in \\cite{Gregor10}, coined LISTA, which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately.   In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails."}
{"text": "  Multi-label classification deals with the problem where each instance is associated with multiple class labels. Because evaluation in multi-label classification is more complicated than single-label setting, a number of performance measures have been proposed. It is noticed that an algorithm usually performs differently on different measures. Therefore, it is important to understand which algorithms perform well on which measure(s) and why. In this paper, we propose a unified margin view to revisit eleven performance measures in multi-label classification. In particular, we define label-wise margin and instance-wise margin, and prove that through maximizing these margins, different corresponding performance measures will be optimized. Based on the defined margins, a max-margin approach called LIMO is designed and empirical results verify our theoretical findings."}
{"text": "  We develop an automated variational method for inference in models with Gaussian process (GP) priors and general likelihoods. The method supports multiple outputs and multiple latent functions and does not require detailed knowledge of the conditional likelihood, only needing its evaluation as a black-box function. Using a mixture of Gaussians as the variational distribution, we show that the evidence lower bound and its gradients can be estimated efficiently using samples from univariate Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, the method is scalable to large datasets which is achieved by using an augmented prior via the inducing-variable approach underpinning most sparse GP approximations, along with parallel computation and stochastic optimization. We evaluate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively with experiments on small datasets, medium-scale datasets and large datasets, showing its competitiveness under different likelihood models and sparsity levels. On the large-scale experiments involving prediction of airline delays and classification of handwritten digits, we show that our method is on par with the state-of-the-art hard-coded approaches for scalable GP regression and classification."}
{"text": "  With the rise of big data sets, the popularity of kernel methods declined and neural networks took over again. The main problem with kernel methods is that the kernel matrix grows quadratically with the number of data points. Most attempts to scale up kernel methods solve this problem by discarding data points or basis functions of some approximation of the kernel map. Here we present a simple yet effective alternative for scaling up kernel methods that takes into account the entire data set via doubly stochastic optimization of the emprical kernel map. The algorithm is straightforward to implement, in particular in parallel execution settings; it leverages the full power and versatility of classical kernel functions without the need to explicitly formulate a kernel map approximation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm works on large data sets."}
{"text": "  We describe the class of convexified convolutional neural networks (CCNNs), which capture the parameter sharing of convolutional neural networks in a convex manner. By representing the nonlinear convolutional filters as vectors in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the CNN parameters can be represented as a low-rank matrix, which can be relaxed to obtain a convex optimization problem. For learning two-layer convolutional neural networks, we prove that the generalization error obtained by a convexified CNN converges to that of the best possible CNN. For learning deeper networks, we train CCNNs in a layer-wise manner. Empirically, CCNNs achieve performance competitive with CNNs trained by backpropagation, SVMs, fully-connected neural networks, stacked denoising auto-encoders, and other baseline methods."}
{"text": "  This work presents PESMOC, Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Constraints, an information-based strategy for the simultaneous optimization of multiple expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions under the presence of several constraints. PESMOC can hence be used to solve a wide range of optimization problems. Iteratively, PESMOC chooses an input location on which to evaluate the objective functions and the constraints so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the Pareto set of the corresponding optimization problem. The constraints considered in PESMOC are assumed to have similar properties to those of the objective functions in typical Bayesian optimization problems. That is, they do not have a known expression (which prevents gradient computation), their evaluation is considered to be very expensive, and the resulting observations may be corrupted by noise. These constraints arise in a plethora of expensive black-box optimization problems. We carry out synthetic experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of PESMOC, where we sample both the objectives and the constraints from a Gaussian process prior. The results obtained show that PESMOC is able to provide better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations than a strategy based on random search."}
{"text": "  This paper introduces the first system for performing automatic orchestration based on a real-time piano input. We believe that it is possible to learn the underlying regularities existing between piano scores and their orchestrations by notorious composers, in order to automatically perform this task on novel piano inputs. To that end, we investigate a class of statistical inference models called conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (cRBM). We introduce a specific evaluation framework for orchestral generation based on a prediction task in order to assess the quality of different models. As prediction and creation are two widely different endeavours, we discuss the potential biases in evaluating temporal generative models through prediction tasks and their impact on a creative system. Finally, we introduce an implementation of the proposed model called Live Orchestral Piano (LOP), which allows to perform real-time projective orchestration of a MIDI keyboard input."}
{"text": "  Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, the interpretability of PCA remains limited. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as Sparse PCA, have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images accounting for most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining l1 and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes higher order information about the structure of the data. This paper presents the structured sparse PCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of SPCA-TV on three different data sets. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches are significant,since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easy to interpret, and are more stable across different samples."}
{"text": "  We study the task of maximizing rewards from recommending items (actions) to users sequentially interacting with a recommender system. Users are modeled as latent mixtures of C many representative user classes, where each class specifies a mean reward profile across actions. Both the user features (mixture distribution over classes) and the item features (mean reward vector per class) are unknown a priori. The user identity is the only contextual information available to the learner while interacting. This induces a low-rank structure on the matrix of expected rewards r a,b from recommending item a to user b. The problem reduces to the well-known linear bandit when either user or item-side features are perfectly known. In the setting where each user, with its stochastically sampled taste profile, interacts only for a small number of sessions, we develop a bandit algorithm for the two-sided uncertainty. It combines the Robust Tensor Power Method of Anandkumar et al. (2014b) with the OFUL linear bandit algorithm of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011). We provide the first rigorous regret analysis of this combination, showing that its regret after T user interactions is $\\tilde O(C\\sqrt{BT})$, with B the number of users. An ingredient towards this result is a novel robustness property of OFUL, of independent interest."}
{"text": "  Learning both hierarchical and temporal representation has been among the long-standing challenges of recurrent neural networks. Multiscale recurrent neural networks have been considered as a promising approach to resolve this issue, yet there has been a lack of empirical evidence showing that this type of models can actually capture the temporal dependencies by discovering the latent hierarchical structure of the sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale approach, called the hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural networks, which can capture the latent hierarchical structure in the sequence by encoding the temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism. We show some evidence that our proposed multiscale architecture can discover underlying hierarchical structure in the sequences without using explicit boundary information. We evaluate our proposed model on character-level language modelling and handwriting sequence modelling."}
{"text": "  Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) methods minimize the divergence between the similarity matrix of a high-dimensional data set and its counterpart from a low-dimensional embedding, leading to widely applied tools for data visualization. Despite their popularity, the current SNE methods experience a crowding problem when the data include highly imbalanced similarities. This implies that the data points with higher total similarity tend to get crowded around the display center. To solve this problem, we introduce a fast normalization method and normalize the similarity matrix to be doubly stochastic such that all the data points have equal total similarities. Furthermore, we show empirically and theoretically that the doubly stochasticity constraint often leads to embeddings which are approximately spherical. This suggests replacing a flat space with spheres as the embedding space. The spherical embedding eliminates the discrepancy between the center and the periphery in visualization, which efficiently resolves the crowding problem. We compared the proposed method (DOSNES) with the state-of-the-art SNE method on three real-world datasets and the results clearly indicate that our method is more favorable in terms of visualization quality."}
{"text": "  Online Convex Optimization plays a key role in large scale machine learning. Early approaches to this problem were conservative, in which the main focus was protection against the worst case scenario. But recently several algorithms have been developed for tightening the regret bounds in easy data instances such as sparsity, predictable sequences, and curved losses. In this work we unify some of these existing techniques to obtain new update rules for the cases when these easy instances occur together. First we analyse an adaptive and optimistic update rule which achieves tighter regret bound when the loss sequence is sparse and predictable. Then we explain an update rule that dynamically adapts to the curvature of the loss function and utilizes the predictable nature of the loss sequence as well. Finally we extend these results to composite losses."}
{"text": "  A major problem in computational learning theory is whether the class of formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is efficiently learnable. Although it is known that this class cannot be polynomially learned using either membership or equivalence queries alone, it is open whether CNF can be polynomially learned using both types of queries. One of the most important results concerning a restriction of the class CNF is that propositional Horn formulas are polynomial time learnable in Angluin's exact learning model with membership and equivalence queries. In this work we push this boundary and show that the class of multivalued dependency formulas (MVDF) is polynomially learnable from interpretations. We then provide a notion of reduction between learning problems in Angluin's model, showing that a transformation of the algorithm suffices to efficiently learn multivalued database dependencies from data relations. We also show via reductions that our main result extends well known previous results and allows us to find alternative solutions for them."}
{"text": "  Accurate estimation of spatial gait characteristics is critical to assess motor impairments resulting from neurological or musculoskeletal disease. Currently, however, methodological constraints limit clinical applicability of state-of-the-art double integration approaches to gait patterns with a clear zero-velocity phase. We describe a novel approach to stride length estimation that uses deep convolutional neural networks to map stride-specific inertial sensor data to the resulting stride length. The model is trained on a publicly available and clinically relevant benchmark dataset consisting of 1220 strides from 101 geriatric patients. Evaluation is done in a 10-fold cross validation and for three different stride definitions. Even though best results are achieved with strides defined from mid-stance to mid-stance with average accuracy and precision of 0.01 $\\pm$ 5.37 cm, performance does not strongly depend on stride definition. The achieved precision outperforms state-of-the-art methods evaluated on this benchmark dataset by 3.0 cm (36%). Due to the independence of stride definition, the proposed method is not subject to the methodological constrains that limit applicability of state-of-the-art double integration methods. Furthermore, precision on the benchmark dataset could be improved. With more precise mobile stride length estimation, new insights to the progression of neurological disease or early indications might be gained. Due to the independence of stride definition, previously uncharted diseases in terms of mobile gait analysis can now be investigated by re-training and applying the proposed method."}
{"text": "  Measurement of stride-related, biomechanical parameters is the common rationale for objective gait impairment scoring. State-of-the-art double integration approaches to extract these parameters from inertial sensor data are, however, limited in their clinical applicability due to the underlying assumptions. To overcome this, we present a method to translate the abstract information provided by wearable sensors to context-related expert features based on deep convolutional neural networks. Regarding mobile gait analysis, this enables integration-free and data-driven extraction of a set of 8 spatio-temporal stride parameters. To this end, two modelling approaches are compared: A combined network estimating all parameters of interest and an ensemble approach that spawns less complex networks for each parameter individually. The ensemble approach is outperforming the combined modelling in the current application. On a clinically relevant and publicly available benchmark dataset, we estimate stride length, width and medio-lateral change in foot angle up to ${-0.15\\pm6.09}$ cm, ${-0.09\\pm4.22}$ cm and ${0.13 \\pm 3.78^\\circ}$ respectively. Stride, swing and stance time as well as heel and toe contact times are estimated up to ${\\pm 0.07}$, ${\\pm0.05}$, ${\\pm 0.07}$, ${\\pm0.07}$ and ${\\pm0.12}$ s respectively. This is comparable to and in parts outperforming or defining state-of-the-art. Our results further indicate that the proposed change in methodology could substitute assumption-driven double-integration methods and enable mobile assessment of spatio-temporal stride parameters in clinically critical situations as e.g. in the case of spastic gait impairments."}
{"text": "  Here we study the problem of learning labels for large text corpora where each text can be assigned a variable number of labels. The problem might seem trivial when the label dimensionality is small and can be easily solved using a series of one-vs-all classifiers. However, as the label dimensionality increases to several thousand, the parameter space becomes extremely large, and it is no longer possible to use the one-vs-all technique. Here we propose a model based on the factorization of higher order moments of the words in the corpora, as well as the cross moment between the labels and the words for multi-label prediction. Our model provides guaranteed convergence bounds on the estimated parameters. Further, our model takes only three passes through the training dataset to extract the parameters, resulting in a highly scalable algorithm that can train on GB's of data consisting of millions of documents with hundreds of thousands of labels using a nominal resource of a single processor with 16GB RAM. Our model achieves 10x-15x order of speed-up on large-scale datasets while producing competitive performance in comparison with existing benchmark algorithms."}
{"text": "  Through sequence-based classification, this paper tries to accurately predict the DNA binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) in an unannotated cellular context. Related methods in the literature fail to perform such predictions accurately, since they do not consider sample distribution shift of sequence segments from an annotated (source) context to an unannotated (target) context. We, therefore, propose a method called \"Transfer String Kernel\" (TSK) that achieves improved prediction of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) using knowledge transfer via cross-context sample adaptation. TSK maps sequence segments to a high-dimensional feature space using a discriminative mismatch string kernel framework. In this high-dimensional space, labeled examples of the source context are re-weighted so that the revised sample distribution matches the target context more closely. We have experimentally verified TSK for TFBS identifications on fourteen different TFs under a cross-organism setting. We find that TSK consistently outperforms the state-of the-art TFBS tools, especially when working with TFs whose binding sequences are not conserved across contexts. We also demonstrate the generalizability of TSK by showing its cutting-edge performance on a different set of cross-context tasks for the MHC peptide binding predictions."}
{"text": "  Higher-level cognition depends on the ability to learn models of the world. We can characterize this at the computational level as a structure-learning problem with the goal of best identifying the prevailing causal relationships among a set of relata. However, the computational cost of performing exact Bayesian inference over causal models grows rapidly as the number of relata increases. This implies that the cognitive processes underlying causal learning must be substantially approximate. A powerful class of approximations that focuses on the sequential absorption of successive inputs is captured by the Neurath's ship metaphor in philosophy of science, where theory change is cast as a stochastic and gradual process shaped as much by people's limited willingness to abandon their current theory when considering alternatives as by the ground truth they hope to approach. Inspired by this metaphor and by algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference in machine learning, we propose an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning under which learners represent only a single global hypothesis that they update locally as they gather evidence. We propose a related scheme for understanding how, under these limitations, learners choose informative interventions that manipulate the causal system to help elucidate its workings. We find support for our approach in the analysis of four experiments."}
{"text": "  We develop an automated variational inference method for Bayesian structured prediction problems with Gaussian process (GP) priors and linear-chain likelihoods. Our approach does not need to know the details of the structured likelihood model and can scale up to a large number of observations. Furthermore, we show that the required expected likelihood term and its gradients in the variational objective (ELBO) can be estimated efficiently by using expectations over very low-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Optimization of the ELBO is fully parallelizable over sequences and amenable to stochastic optimization, which we use along with control variate techniques and state-of-the-art incremental optimization to make our framework useful in practice. Results on a set of natural language processing tasks show that our method can be as good as (and sometimes better than) hard-coded approaches including SVM-struct and CRFs, and overcomes the scalability limitations of previous inference algorithms based on sampling. Overall, this is a fundamental step to developing automated inference methods for Bayesian structured prediction."}
{"text": "  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates proposals for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by simulating the dynamics of a Hamiltonian system. However, HMC is sensitive to large time discretizations and performs poorly if there is a mismatch between the spatial geometry of the target distribution and the scales of the momentum distribution. In particular the mass matrix of HMC is hard to tune well. In order to alleviate these problems we propose relativistic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a version of HMC based on relativistic dynamics that introduce a maximum velocity on particles. We also derive stochastic gradient versions of the algorithm and show that the resulting algorithms bear interesting relationships to gradient clipping, RMSprop, Adagrad and Adam, popular optimisation methods in deep learning. Based on this, we develop relativistic stochastic gradient descent by taking the zero-temperature limit of relativistic stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In experiments we show that the relativistic algorithms perform better than classical Newtonian variants and Adam."}
{"text": "  Optimal transport is a powerful framework for computing distances between probability distributions. We unify the two main approaches to optimal transport, namely Monge-Kantorovitch and Sinkhorn-Cuturi, into what we define as Tsallis regularized optimal transport (\\trot). \\trot~interpolates a rich family of distortions from Wasserstein to Kullback-Leibler, encompassing as well Pearson, Neyman and Hellinger divergences, to name a few. We show that metric properties known for Sinkhorn-Cuturi generalize to \\trot, and provide efficient algorithms for finding the optimal transportation plan with formal convergence proofs. We also present the first application of optimal transport to the problem of ecological inference, that is, the reconstruction of joint distributions from their marginals, a problem of large interest in the social sciences. \\trot~provides a convenient framework for ecological inference by allowing to compute the joint distribution --- that is, the optimal transportation plan itself --- when side information is available, which is \\textit{e.g.} typically what census represents in political science. Experiments on data from the 2012 US presidential elections display the potential of \\trot~in delivering a faithful reconstruction of the joint distribution of ethnic groups and voter preferences."}
{"text": "  Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing gradient descent."}
{"text": "  Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) is an elegant approach for unsupervised segmentation if the data points of each cluster are located in linear subspaces. This model applies, for instance, in motion segmentation if some restrictions on the camera model hold. SSC requires that problems based on the $l_1$-norm are solved to infer which points belong to the same subspace. If these unknown subspaces are well-separated this algorithm is guaranteed to succeed. The algorithm rests upon the assumption that points on the same subspace are well spread. The question what happens if this condition is violated has not yet been investigated. In this work, the effect of particular distributions on the same subspace will be analyzed. It will be shown that SSC fails to infer correct labels if points on the same subspace fall into more than one cluster."}
{"text": "  Understanding the relationships between different properties of data, such as whether a connectome or genome has information about disease status, is becoming increasingly important in modern biological datasets. While existing approaches can test whether two properties are related, they often require unfeasibly large sample sizes in real data scenarios, and do not provide any insight into how or why the procedure reached its decision. Our approach, \"Multiscale Graph Correlation\" (MGC), is a dependence test that juxtaposes previously disparate data science techniques, including k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods (such as support vector machines), and multiscale analysis (such as wavelets). Other methods typically require double or triple the number samples to achieve the same statistical power as MGC in a benchmark suite including high-dimensional and nonlinear relationships - spanning polynomial (linear, quadratic, cubic), trigonometric (sinusoidal, circular, ellipsoidal, spiral), geometric (square, diamond, W-shape), and other functions, with dimensionality ranging from 1 to 1000. Moreover, MGC uniquely provides a simple and elegant characterization of the potentially complex latent geometry underlying the relationship, providing insight while maintaining computational efficiency. In several real data applications, including brain imaging and cancer genetics, MGC is the only method that can both detect the presence of a dependency and provide specific guidance for the next experiment and/or analysis to conduct."}

As the first step, this paper investigates the matter for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We conduct the study with Replicated Softmax, a variant of RBMs for unsupervised text analysis. We present a method for learning what we call Sparse Boltzmann Machines, where each hidden unit is connected to a subset of the visible units instead of all of them. Empirical results show that the method yields models with significantly improved model fit and interpretability as compared with RBMs where each hidden unit is connected to all visible units."}
{"text": "  The standard techniques for online learning of combinatorial objects perform multiplicative updates followed by projections into the convex hull of all the objects. However, this methodology can be expensive if the convex hull contains many facets. For example, the convex hull of $n$-symbol Huffman trees is known to have exponentially many facets (Maurras et al., 2010). We get around this difficulty by exploiting extended formulations (Kaibel, 2011), which encode the polytope of combinatorial objects in a higher dimensional \"extended\" space with only polynomially many facets. We develop a general framework for converting extended formulations into efficient online algorithms with good relative loss bounds. We present applications of our framework to online learning of Huffman trees and permutations. The regret bounds of the resulting algorithms are within a factor of $O(\\sqrt{\\log(n)})$ of the state-of-the-art specialized algorithms for permutations, and depending on the loss regimes, improve on or match the state-of-the-art for Huffman trees. Our method is general and can be applied to other combinatorial objects."}
{"text": "  Opponent modeling is necessary in multi-agent settings where secondary agents with competing goals also adapt their strategies, yet it remains challenging because strategies interact with each other and change. Most previous work focuses on developing probabilistic models or parameterized strategies for specific applications. Inspired by the recent success of deep reinforcement learning, we present neural-based models that jointly learn a policy and the behavior of opponents. Instead of explicitly predicting the opponent's action, we encode observation of the opponents into a deep Q-Network (DQN); however, we retain explicit modeling (if desired) using multitasking. By using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, our model automatically discovers different strategy patterns of opponents without extra supervision. We evaluate our models on a simulated soccer game and a popular trivia game, showing superior performance over DQN and its variants."}
{"text": "  Stochastic gradient-boosted decision trees are widely employed for multivariate classification and regression tasks. This paper presents a speed-optimized and cache-friendly implementation for multivariate classification called FastBDT. FastBDT is one order of magnitude faster during the fitting-phase and application-phase, in comparison with popular implementations in software frameworks like TMVA, scikit-learn and XGBoost. The concepts used to optimize the execution time and performance studies are discussed in detail in this paper. The key ideas include: An equal-frequency binning on the input data, which allows replacing expensive floating-point with integer operations, while at the same time increasing the quality of the classification; a cache-friendly linear access pattern to the input data, in contrast to usual implementations, which exhibit a random access pattern. FastBDT provides interfaces to C/C++, Python and TMVA. It is extensively used in the field of high energy physics by the Belle II experiment."}

{"text": "  Deep neural networks are learning models with a very high capacity and therefore prone to over-fitting. Many regularization techniques such as Dropout, DropConnect, and weight decay all attempt to solve the problem of over-fitting by reducing the capacity of their respective models (Srivastava et al., 2014), (Wan et al., 2013), (Krogh & Hertz, 1992). In this paper we introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model. The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and simplified the complexity of the learning problem. SoftTarget regularization proved to be an effective tool in various neural network architectures."}
{"text": "  We extend the adaptive regression spline model by incorporating saturation, the natural requirement that a function extend as a constant outside a certain range. We fit saturating splines to data using a convex optimization problem over a space of measures, which we solve using an efficient algorithm based on the conditional gradient method. Unlike many existing approaches, our algorithm solves the original infinite-dimensional (for splines of degree at least two) optimization problem without pre-specified knot locations. We then adapt our algorithm to fit generalized additive models with saturating splines as coordinate functions and show that the saturation requirement allows our model to simultaneously perform feature selection and nonlinear function fitting. Finally, we briefly sketch how the method can be extended to higher order splines and to different requirements on the extension outside the data range."}
{"text": "  In hearing aids, the presence of babble noise degrades hearing intelligibility of human speech greatly. However, removing the babble without creating artifacts in human speech is a challenging task in a low SNR environment. Here, we sought to solve the problem by finding a `mapping' between noisy speech spectra and clean speech spectra via supervised learning. Specifically, we propose using fully Convolutional Neural Networks, which consist of lesser number of parameters than fully connected networks. The proposed network, Redundant Convolutional Encoder Decoder (R-CED), demonstrates that a convolutional network can be 12 times smaller than a recurrent network and yet achieves better performance, which shows its applicability for an embedded system: the hearing aids."}
{"text": "  In many applications (in particular information systems, such as pattern recognition, machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics to name but a few) the assessment of uncertainty is essential - i.e., the estimation of the underlying probability distribution function. More often than not, the form of this function is unknown and it becomes necessary to non-parametrically construct/estimate it from a given sample. One of the methods of choice to non-parametrically estimate the unknown probability distribution function for a given random variable (defined on binary space) has been the expansion of the estimation function in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions. In this paper we demonstrate that the expansion of the probability distribution function estimation in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions is equivalent to the expansion of the function estimation in a set of \"Dirac kernel\" functions. The latter approach can ameliorate the computational bottleneck and notational awkwardness often associated with the Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions approach, in particular when the binary input space is large."}
{"text": "  The softmax representation of probabilities for categorical variables plays a prominent role in modern machine learning with numerous applications in areas such as large scale classification, neural language modeling and recommendation systems. However, softmax estimation is very expensive for large scale inference because of the high cost associated with computing the normalizing constant. Here, we introduce an efficient approximation to softmax probabilities which takes the form of a rigorous lower bound on the exact probability. This bound is expressed as a product over pairwise probabilities and it leads to scalable estimation based on stochastic optimization. It allows us to perform doubly stochastic estimation by subsampling both training instances and class labels. We show that the new bound has interesting theoretical properties and we demonstrate its use in classification problems."}
{"text": "  The staggering amount of streaming time series coming from the real world calls for more efficient and effective online modeling solution. For time series modeling, most existing works make some unrealistic assumptions such as the input data is of fixed length or well aligned, which requires extra effort on segmentation or normalization of the raw streaming data. Although some literature claim their approaches to be invariant to data length and misalignment, they are too time-consuming to model a streaming time series in an online manner. We propose a novel and more practical online modeling and classification scheme, DDE-MGM, which does not make any assumptions on the time series while maintaining high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. The derivative delay embedding (DDE) is developed to incrementally transform time series to the embedding space, where the intrinsic characteristics of data is preserved as recursive patterns regardless of the stream length and misalignment. Then, a non-parametric Markov geographic model (MGM) is proposed to both model and classify the pattern in an online manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior classification accuracy of the proposed DDE-MGM in an online setting as compared to the state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "  Bounded agents are limited by intrinsic constraints on their ability to process information that is available in their sensors and memory and choose actions and memory updates. In this dissertation, we model these constraints as information-rate constraints on communication channels connecting these various internal components of the agent. We make four major contributions detailed below and many smaller contributions detailed in each section. First, we formulate the problem of optimizing the agent under both extrinsic and intrinsic constraints and develop the main tools for solving it. Second, we identify another reason for the challenging convergence properties of the optimization algorithm, which is the bifurcation structure of the update operator near phase transitions. Third, we study the special case of linear-Gaussian dynamics and quadratic cost (LQG), where the optimal solution has a particularly simple and solvable form. Fourth, we explore the learning task, where the model of the world dynamics is unknown and sample-based updates are used instead."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes new nonnegative (shallow and multi-layer) autoencoders by combining the spiking Random Neural Network (RNN) model, the network architecture typical used in deep-learning area and the training technique inspired from nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The shallow autoencoder is a simplified RNN model, which is then stacked into a multi-layer architecture. The learning algorithm is based on the weight update rules in NMF, subject to the nonnegative probability constraints of the RNN. The autoencoders equipped with this learning algorithm are tested on typical image datasets including the MNIST, Yale face and CIFAR-10 datasets, and also using 16 real-world datasets from different areas. The results obtained through these tests yield the desired high learning and recognition accuracy. Also, numerical simulations of the stochastic spiking behavior of this RNN auto encoder, show that it can be implemented in a highly-distributed manner."}
{"text": "  Variational inference lies at the core of many state-of-the-art algorithms. To improve the approximation of the posterior beyond parametric families, it was proposed to include MCMC steps into the variational lower bound. In this work we explore this idea using steps of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, an efficient MCMC method. In particular, we incorporate the acceptance step of the HMC algorithm, guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the true posterior. Additionally, we introduce some extensions to the HMC algorithm geared towards faster convergence. The theoretical advantages of these modifications are reflected by performance improvements in our experimental results."}
{"text": "  With the scale of data growing every day, reducing the dimensionality (a.k.a. sketching) of high-dimensional data has emerged as a task of paramount importance. Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume of data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format of acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these challenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning approach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical (bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit and Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process lying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies on low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized maximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via alternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical data `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new incomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight first-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an extra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly along with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models. Performance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite data streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary point set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear regret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes for real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification."}
{"text": "  Our objective is to efficiently design a robust projection matrix $\\Phi$ for the Compressive Sensing (CS) systems when applied to the signals that are not exactly sparse. The optimal projection matrix is obtained by mainly minimizing the average coherence of the equivalent dictionary. In order to drop the requirement of the sparse representation error (SRE) for a set of training data as in [15] [16], we introduce a novel penalty function independent of a particular SRE matrix. Without requiring of training data, we can efficiently design the robust projection matrix and apply it for most of CS systems, like a CS system for image processing with a conventional wavelet dictionary in which the SRE matrix is generally not available. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate with natural images that under similar compression rate, a CS system with a learned dictionary in high dimensions outperforms the one in low dimensions in terms of reconstruction accuracy. This together with the fact that our proposed method can efficiently work in high dimension suggests that a CS system can be potentially implemented beyond the small patches in sparsity-based image processing."}
{"text": "  In the era of big data, it is becoming common to have data with multiple modalities or coming from multiple sources, known as \"multi-view data\". Multi-view data are usually unlabeled and come from high-dimensional spaces (such as language vocabularies), unsupervised multi-view feature selection is crucial to many applications. However, it is nontrivial due to the following challenges. First, there are too many instances or the feature dimensionality is too large. Thus, the data may not fit in memory. How to select useful features with limited memory space? Second, how to select features from streaming data and handles the concept drift? Third, how to leverage the consistent and complementary information from different views to improve the feature selection in the situation when the data are too big or come in as streams? To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works can solve all the challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an Online unsupervised Multi-View Feature Selection, OMVFS, which deals with large-scale/streaming multi-view data in an online fashion. OMVFS embeds unsupervised feature selection into a clustering algorithm via NMF with sparse learning. It further incorporates the graph regularization to preserve the local structure information and help select discriminative features. Instead of storing all the historical data, OMVFS processes the multi-view data chunk by chunk and aggregates all the necessary information into several small matrices. By using the buffering technique, the proposed OMVFS can reduce the computational and storage cost while taking advantage of the structure information. Furthermore, OMVFS can capture the concept drifts in the data streams. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed OMVFS method. More importantly, OMVFS is about 100 times faster than the off-line methods."}
{"text": "  Regularized empirical risk minimization (R-ERM) is an important branch of machine learning, since it constrains the capacity of the hypothesis space and guarantees the generalization ability of the learning algorithm. Two classic proximal optimization algorithms, i.e., proximal stochastic gradient descent (ProxSGD) and proximal stochastic coordinate descent (ProxSCD) have been widely used to solve the R-ERM problem. Recently, variance reduction technique was proposed to improve ProxSGD and ProxSCD, and the corresponding ProxSVRG and ProxSVRCD have better convergence rate. These proximal algorithms with variance reduction technique have also achieved great success in applications at small and moderate scales. However, in order to solve large-scale R-ERM problems and make more practical impacts, the parallel version of these algorithms are sorely needed. In this paper, we propose asynchronous ProxSVRG (Async-ProxSVRG) and asynchronous ProxSVRCD (Async-ProxSVRCD) algorithms, and prove that Async-ProxSVRG can achieve near linear speedup when the training data is sparse, while Async-ProxSVRCD can achieve near linear speedup regardless of the sparse condition, as long as the number of block partitions are appropriately set. We have conducted experiments on a regularized logistic regression task. The results verified our theoretical findings and demonstrated the practical efficiency of the asynchronous stochastic proximal algorithms with variance reduction."}
{"text": "  To date, the instability of prognostic predictors in a sparse high dimensional model, which hinders their clinical adoption, has received little attention. Stable prediction is often overlooked in favour of performance. Yet, stability prevails as key when adopting models in critical areas as healthcare. Our study proposes a stabilization scheme by detecting higher order feature correlations. Using a linear model as basis for prediction, we achieve feature stability by regularising latent correlation in features. Latent higher order correlation among features is modelled using an autoencoder network. Stability is enhanced by combining a recent technique that uses a feature graph, and augmenting external unlabelled data for training the autoencoder network. Our experiments are conducted on a heart failure cohort from an Australian hospital. Stability was measured using Consistency index for feature subsets and signal-to-noise ratio for model parameters. Our methods demonstrated significant improvement in feature stability and model estimation stability when compared to baselines."}
{"text": "  This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also known as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network. Hypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in nature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a phenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in evolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and thus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful for deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where hypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers. Our main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM and achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling tasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and neural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for recurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to convolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition tasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer learnable parameters."}

We give empirical evidence that the birth and death process has superior mixing properties."}
{"text": "  Detecting and quantifying anomalies in urban traffic is critical for real-time alerting or re-routing in the short run and urban planning in the long run. We describe a two-step framework that achieves these two goals in a robust, fast, online, and unsupervised manner. First, we adapt stable principal component pursuit to detect anomalies for each road segment. This allows us to pinpoint traffic anomalies early and precisely in space. Then we group the road-level anomalies across time and space into meaningful anomaly events using a simple graph expansion procedure. These events can be easily clustered, visualized, and analyzed by urban planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using 7 weeks of anonymized and aggregated cellular location data in Dallas-Fort Worth. We suggest potential opportunities for urban planners and policy makers to use our methodology to make informed changes. These applications include real-time re-routing of traffic in response to abnormally high traffic, or identifying candidates for high-impact infrastructure projects."}
{"text": "  Gaussian processes are powerful, yet analytically tractable models for supervised learning. A Gaussian process is characterized by a mean function and a covariance function (kernel), which are determined by a model selection criterion. The functions to be compared do not just differ in their parametrization but in their fundamental structure. It is often not clear which function structure to choose, for instance to decide between a squared exponential and a rational quadratic kernel. Based on the principle of approximation set coding, we develop a framework for model selection to rank kernels for Gaussian process regression. In our experiments approximation set coding shows promise to become a model selection criterion competitive with maximum evidence (also called marginal likelihood) and leave-one-out cross-validation."}

{"text": "  Beyond its highly publicized victories in Go, there have been numerous successful applications of deep learning in information retrieval, computer vision and speech recognition. In cybersecurity, an increasing number of companies have become excited about the potential of deep learning, and have started to use it for various security incidents, the most popular being malware detection. These companies assert that deep learning (DL) could help turn the tide in the battle against malware infections. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, a flaw that plagues most if not all statistical learning models. Recent research has demonstrated that those with malicious intent can easily circumvent deep learning-powered malware detection by exploiting this flaw.   In order to address this problem, previous work has developed various defense mechanisms that either augmenting training data or enhance model's complexity. However, after a thorough analysis of the fundamental flaw in DNNs, we discover that the effectiveness of current defenses is limited and, more importantly, cannot provide theoretical guarantees as to their robustness against adversarial sampled-based attacks. As such, we propose a new adversary resistant technique that obstructs attackers from constructing impactful adversarial samples by randomly nullifying features within samples. In this work, we evaluate our proposed technique against a real world dataset with 14,679 malware variants and 17,399 benign programs. We theoretically validate the robustness of our technique, and empirically show that our technique significantly boosts DNN robustness to adversarial samples while maintaining high accuracy in classification. To demonstrate the general applicability of our proposed method, we also conduct experiments using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, generally used in image recognition research."}

{"text": "  Constrained adaptive filtering algorithms inculding constrained least mean square (CLMS), constrained affine projection (CAP) and constrained recursive least squares (CRLS) have been extensively studied in many applications. Most existing constrained adaptive filtering algorithms are developed under mean square error (MSE) criterion, which is an ideal optimality criterion under Gaussian noises. This assumption however fails to model the behavior of non-Gaussian noises found in practice. Motivated by the robustness and simplicity of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) in non-Gaussian impulsive noises, this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering algorithm called constrained maximum correntropy criterion (CMCC). Specifically, CMCC incorporates a linear constraint into a MCC filter to solve a constrained optimization problem explicitly. The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm is easy to implement and has low computational complexity, and in terms of convergence accuracy (say lower mean square deviation) and stability, can significantly outperform those MSE based constrained adaptive algorithms in presence of heavy-tailed impulsive noises. Additionally, the mean square convergence behaviors are studied under energy conservation relation, and a sufficient condition to ensure the mean square convergence and the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) of the proposed algorithm are obtained. Simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions under both Gaussian and non- Gaussian noises, and demonstrate the excellent performance of the novel algorithm by comparing it with other conventional methods."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks have proven to be quite effective in a wide variety of machine learning tasks, ranging from improved speech recognition systems to advancing the development of autonomous vehicles. However, despite their superior performance in many applications, these models have been recently shown to be susceptible to a particular type of attack possible through the generation of particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples. These samples are constructed by manipulating real examples from the training data distribution in order to \"fool\" the original neural model, resulting in misclassification (with high confidence) of previously correctly classified samples. Addressing this weakness is of utmost importance if deep neural architectures are to be applied to critical applications, such as those in the domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we present an analysis of this fundamental flaw lurking in all neural architectures to uncover limitations of previously proposed defense mechanisms. More importantly, we present a unifying framework for protecting deep neural models using a non-invertible data transformation--developing two adversary-resilient architectures utilizing both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Empirical results indicate that our framework provides better robustness compared to state-of-art solutions while having negligible degradation in accuracy."}
{"text": "  Online model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods with continuous actions are playing a prominent role when dealing with real-world applications such as Robotics. However, when confronted to non-stationary environments, these methods crucially rely on an exploration-exploitation trade-off which is rarely dynamically and automatically adjusted to changes in the environment. Here we propose an active exploration algorithm for RL in structured (parameterized) continuous action space. This framework deals with a set of discrete actions, each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. Discrete exploration is controlled through a Boltzmann softmax function with an inverse temperature $\\beta$ parameter. In parallel, a Gaussian exploration is applied to the continuous action parameters. We apply a meta-learning algorithm based on the comparison between variations of short-term and long-term reward running averages to simultaneously tune $\\beta$ and the width of the Gaussian distribution from which continuous action parameters are drawn. When applied to a simple virtual human-robot interaction task, we show that this algorithm outperforms continuous parameterized RL both without active exploration and with active exploration based on uncertainty variations measured by a Kalman-Q-learning algorithm."}
{"text": "  The reparameterization gradient has become a widely used method to obtain Monte Carlo gradients to optimize the variational objective. However, this technique does not easily apply to commonly used distributions such as beta or gamma without further approximations, and most practical applications of the reparameterization gradient fit Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we introduce the generalized reparameterization gradient, a method that extends the reparameterization gradient to a wider class of variational distributions. Generalized reparameterizations use invertible transformations of the latent variables which lead to transformed distributions that weakly depend on the variational parameters. This results in new Monte Carlo gradients that combine reparameterization gradients and score function gradients. We demonstrate our approach on variational inference for two complex probabilistic models. The generalized reparameterization is effective: even a single sample from the variational distribution is enough to obtain a low-variance gradient."}
{"text": "  We propose a criterion for discrimination against a specified sensitive attribute in supervised learning, where the goal is to predict some target based on available features. Assuming data about the predictor, target, and membership in the protected group are available, we show how to optimally adjust any learned predictor so as to remove discrimination according to our definition. Our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor classification from disadvantaged groups to the decision maker, who can respond by improving the classification accuracy.   In line with other studies, our notion is oblivious: it depends only on the joint statistics of the predictor, the target and the protected attribute, but not on interpretation of individualfeatures. We study the inherent limits of defining and identifying biases based on such oblivious measures, outlining what can and cannot be inferred from different oblivious tests.   We illustrate our notion using a case study of FICO credit scores."}

We use the bootstrap to estimate the likelihood for blocks of data followed by mixture sequential probability ratio test. We validate this procedure on data from a major online e-commerce website. We show that the proposed test controls type $1$ error at any time, has good power, is robust to misspecification in the distribution generating the data, and allows quick inference in online randomized experiments."}

In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal.   A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution.   We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of \\federated optimization."}
{"text": "  We describe recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have attracted great attention on sequential tasks, such as handwriting recognition, speech recognition and image to text. However, compared to general feedforward neural networks, RNNs have feedback loops, which makes it a little hard to understand the backpropagation step. Thus, we focus on basics, especially the error backpropagation to compute gradients with respect to model parameters. Further, we go into detail on how error backpropagation algorithm is applied on long short-term memory (LSTM) by unfolding the memory unit."}
{"text": "  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are successful deep generative models. GANs are based on a two-player minimax game. However, the objective function derived in the original motivation is changed to obtain stronger gradients when learning the generator. We propose a novel algorithm that repeats the density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. Our algorithm offers a new perspective toward the understanding of GANs and is able to make use of multiple viewpoints obtained in the research of density ratio estimation, e.g. what divergence is stable and relative density ratio is useful."}
{"text": "  Recent work in distance metric learning has focused on learning transformations of data that best align with specified pairwise similarity and dissimilarity constraints, often supplied by a human observer. The learned transformations lead to improved retrieval, classification, and clustering algorithms due to the better adapted distance or similarity measures. Here, we address the problem of learning these transformations when the underlying constraint generation process is nonstationary. This nonstationarity can be due to changes in either the ground-truth clustering used to generate constraints or changes in the feature subspaces in which the class structure is apparent. We propose Online Convex Ensemble StrongLy Adaptive Dynamic Learning (OCELAD), a general adaptive, online approach for learning and tracking optimal metrics as they change over time that is highly robust to a variety of nonstationary behaviors in the changing metric. We apply the OCELAD framework to an ensemble of online learners. Specifically, we create a retro-initialized composite objective mirror descent (COMID) ensemble (RICE) consisting of a set of parallel COMID learners with different learning rates, demonstrate RICE-OCELAD on both real and synthetic data sets and show significant performance improvements relative to previously proposed batch and online distance metric learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  We derive a novel variational expectation maximization approach based on truncated posterior distributions. Truncated distributions are proportional to exact posteriors within subsets of a discrete state space and equal zero otherwise. The treatment of the distributions' subsets as variational parameters distinguishes the approach from previous variational approaches. The specific structure of truncated distributions allows for deriving novel and mathematically grounded results, which in turn can be used to formulate novel efficient algorithms to optimize the parameters of probabilistic generative models. Most centrally, we find the variational lower bounds that correspond to truncated distributions to be given by very concise and efficiently computable expressions, while update equations for model parameters remain in their standard form. Based on these findings, we show how efficient and easily applicable meta-algorithms can be formulated that guarantee a monotonic increase of the variational bound. Example applications of the here derived framework provide novel theoretical results and learning procedures for latent variable models as well as mixture models. Furthermore, we show that truncated variation EM naturally interpolates between standard EM with full posteriors and EM based on the maximum a-posteriori state (MAP). The approach can, therefore, be regarded as a generalization of the popular `hard EM' approach towards a similarly efficient method which can capture more of the true posterior structure."}
{"text": "  Extracting information from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) images has been a major area of research for more than two decades. The goal of this work is to present a new method for the analysis of fMRI data sets, that is capable to incorporate a priori available information, via an efficient optimization framework. Tests on synthetic data sets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods of this kind."}
{"text": "  We study statistical inference and distributionally robust solution methods for stochastic optimization problems, focusing on confidence intervals for optimal values and solutions that achieve exact coverage asymptotically. We develop a generalized empirical likelihood framework---based on distributional uncertainty sets constructed from nonparametric $f$-divergence balls---for Hadamard differentiable functionals, and in particular, stochastic optimization problems. As consequences of this theory, we provide a principled method for choosing the size of distributional uncertainty regions to provide one- and two-sided confidence intervals that achieve exact coverage. We also give an asymptotic expansion for our distributionally robust formulation, showing how robustification regularizes problems by their variance. Finally, we show that optimizers of the distributionally robust formulations we study enjoy (essentially) the same consistency properties as those in classical sample average approximations. Our general approach applies to quickly mixing stationary sequences, including geometrically ergodic Harris recurrent Markov chains."}
{"text": "  We present deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), a deep multi-view learning model that extends the latent variable model interpretation of linear CCA to nonlinear observation models parameterized by deep neural networks. We derive variational lower bounds of the data likelihood by parameterizing the posterior probability of the latent variables from the view that is available at test time. We also propose a variant of VCCA called VCCA-private that can, in addition to the \"common variables\" underlying both views, extract the \"private variables\" within each view, and disentangles the shared and private information for multi-view data without hard supervision. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our methods are competitive across domains."}
{"text": "  Preserving privacy of continuous and/or high-dimensional data such as images, videos and audios, can be challenging with syntactic anonymization methods which are designed for discrete attributes. Differential privacy, which provides a more formal definition of privacy, has shown more success in sanitizing continuous data. However, both syntactic and differential privacy are susceptible to inference attacks, i.e., an adversary can accurately infer sensitive attributes from sanitized data. The paper proposes a novel filter-based mechanism which preserves privacy of continuous and high-dimensional attributes against inference attacks. Finding the optimal utility-privacy tradeoff is formulated as a min-diff-max optimization problem. The paper provides an ERM-like analysis of the generalization error and also a practical algorithm to perform the optimization. In addition, the paper proposes an extension that combines minimax filter and differentially-private noisy mechanism. Advantages of the method over purely noisy mechanisms is explained and demonstrated with examples. Experiments with several real-world tasks including facial expression classification, speech emotion classification, and activity classification from motion, show that the minimax filter can simultaneously achieve similar or better target task accuracy and lower inference accuracy, often significantly lower than previous methods."}
{"text": "  A novel reinforcement learning benchmark, called Industrial Benchmark, is introduced. The Industrial Benchmark aims at being be realistic in the sense, that it includes a variety of aspects that we found to be vital in industrial applications. It is not designed to be an approximation of any real system, but to pose the same hardness and complexity."}
{"text": "  Sources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument, and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq, are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data is not properly calibrated. We propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects."}
{"text": "  Real life data often includes information from different channels. For example, in computer vision, we can describe an image using different image features, such as pixel intensity, color, HOG, GIST feature, SIFT features, etc.. These different aspects of the same objects are often called multi-view (or multi-modal) data. Low-rank regression model has been proved to be an effective learning mechanism by exploring the low-rank structure of real life data. But previous low-rank regression model only works on single view data. In this paper, we propose a multi-view low-rank regression model by imposing low-rank constraints on multi-view regression model. Most importantly, we provide a closed-form solution to the multi-view low-rank regression model. Extensive experiments on 4 multi-view datasets show that the multi-view low-rank regression model outperforms single-view regression model and reveals that multi-view low-rank structure is very helpful."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider clustering data that is assumed to come from one of finitely many pointed convex polyhedral cones. This model is referred to as the Union of Polyhedral Cones (UOPC) model. Similar to the Union of Subspaces (UOS) model where each data from each subspace is generated from a (unknown) basis, in the UOPC model each data from each cone is assumed to be generated from a finite number of (unknown) \\emph{extreme rays}.To cluster data under this model, we consider several algorithms - (a) Sparse Subspace Clustering by Non-negative constraints Lasso (NCL), (b) Least squares approximation (LSA), and (c) K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to arrive at affinity between data points. Spectral Clustering (SC) is then applied on the resulting affinity matrix to cluster data into different polyhedral cones. We show that on an average KNN outperforms both NCL and LSA and for this algorithm we provide the deterministic conditions for correct clustering. For an affinity measure between the cones it is shown that as long as the cones are not very coherent and as long as the density of data within each cone exceeds a threshold, KNN leads to accurate clustering. Finally, simulation results on real datasets (MNIST and YaleFace datasets) depict that the proposed algorithm works well on real data indicating the utility of the UOPC model and the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Multivariate time series naturally exist in many fields, like energy, bioinformatics, signal processing, and finance. Most of these applications need to be able to compare these structured data. In this context, dynamic time warping (DTW) is probably the most common comparison measure. However, not much research effort has been put into improving it by learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning similarities based on DTW, in order to improve time series classification. Making use of the uniform stability framework, we provide the first theoretical guarantees in the form of a generalization bound for linear classification. The experimental study shows that the proposed approach is efficient, while yielding sparse classifiers."}
{"text": "  Most learning approaches treat dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering separately (i.e., sequentially), but recent research has shown that optimizing the two tasks jointly can substantially improve the performance of both. The premise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via linear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but in practice, the transformation from the latent space to the data can be more complicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and possibly nonlinear function. To recover the `clustering-friendly' latent representations and to better cluster the data, we propose a joint DR and K-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished via learning a deep neural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages of jointly optimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network's ability to approximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can work well for a broad class of generative models. Towards this end, we carefully design the DNN structure and the associated joint optimization criterion, and propose an effective and scalable algorithm to handle the formulated optimization problem. Experiments using different real datasets are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  We propose a communication-efficient distributed estimation method for sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the high dimensional regime. Our method distributes the data of size $N$ into $m$ machines, and estimates a local sparse LDA estimator on each machine using the data subset of size $N/m$. After the distributed estimation, our method aggregates the debiased local estimators from $m$ machines, and sparsifies the aggregated estimator. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimation method, as long as the number of machines $m$ is chosen appropriately. Moreover, we prove that our method can attain the model selection consistency under a milder condition than the centralized method. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "  Density matrices are positively semi-definite Hermitian matrices with unit trace that describe the states of quantum systems. Many quantum systems of physical interest can be represented as high-dimensional low rank density matrices. A popular problem in {\\it quantum state tomography} (QST) is to estimate the unknown low rank density matrix of a quantum system by conducting Pauli measurements. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we establish the minimax lower bounds in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$ for low rank density matrices estimation by Pauli measurements. In our previous paper, these minimax lower bounds are proved under the trace regression model with Gaussian noise and the noise is assumed to have common variance. In this paper, we prove these bounds under the Binomial observation model which meets the actual model in QST.   Second, we study the Dantzig estimator (DE) for estimating the unknown low rank density matrix under the Binomial observation model by using Pauli measurements. In our previous papers, we studied the least squares estimator and the projection estimator, where we proved the optimal convergence rates for the least squares estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq 2$ and, under a stronger condition, the optimal convergence rates for the projection estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$. In this paper, we show that the results of these two distinct estimators can be simultaneously obtained by the Dantzig estimator. Moreover, better convergence rates in Schatten norm distances can be proved for Dantzig estimator under conditions weaker than those needed in previous papers. When the objective function of DE is replaced by the negative von Neumann entropy, we obtain sharp convergence rate in Kullback-Leibler divergence."}
{"text": "  We analyze online and mini-batch k-means variants. Both scale up the widely used Lloyd 's algorithm via stochastic approximation, and have become popular for large-scale clustering and unsupervised feature learning. We show, for the first time, that they have global convergence towards local optima at $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ rate under general conditions. In addition, we show if the dataset is clusterable, with suitable initialization, mini-batch k-means converges to an optimal k-means solution with $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ convergence rate with high probability. The k-means objective is non-convex and non-differentiable: we exploit ideas from non-convex gradient-based optimization by providing a novel characterization of the trajectory of k-means algorithm on its solution space, and circumvent its non-differentiability via geometric insights about k-means update."}
{"text": "  Quantitative modeling of post-transcriptional regulation process is a challenging problem in systems biology. A mechanical model of the regulatory process needs to be able to describe the available spatio-temporal protein concentration and mRNA expression data and recover the continuous spatio-temporal fields. Rigorous methods are required to identify model parameters. A promising approach to deal with these difficulties is proposed using Gaussian process as a prior distribution over the latent function of protein concentration and mRNA expression. In this study, we consider a partial differential equation mechanical model with differential operators and latent function. Since the operators at stake are linear, the information from the physical model can be encoded into the kernel function. Hybrid Monte Carlo methods are employed to carry out Bayesian inference of the partial differential equation parameters and Gaussian process kernel parameters. The spatio-temporal field of protein concentration and mRNA expression are reconstructed without explicitly solving the partial differential equation."}
{"text": "  Importance sampling is widely used in machine learning and statistics, but its power is limited by the restriction of using simple proposals for which the importance weights can be tractably calculated. We address this problem by studying black-box importance sampling methods that calculate importance weights for samples generated from any unknown proposal or black-box mechanism. Our method allows us to use better and richer proposals to solve difficult problems, and (somewhat counter-intuitively) also has the additional benefit of improving the estimation accuracy beyond typical importance sampling. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are provided."}
{"text": "  We propose a unified framework for estimating low-rank matrices through nonconvex optimization based on gradient descent algorithm. Our framework is quite general and can be applied to both noisy and noiseless observations. In the general case with noisy observations, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix up to minimax optimal statistical error, provided an appropriate initial estimator. While in the generic noiseless setting, our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate and enables exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. In addition, we develop a new initialization algorithm to provide a desired initial estimator, which outperforms existing initialization algorithms for nonconvex low-rank matrix estimation. We illustrate the superiority of our framework through three examples: matrix regression, matrix completion, and one-bit matrix completion. We also corroborate our theory through extensive experiments on synthetic data."}
{"text": "  We investigate the capabilities and limitations of Gaussian process models by jointly exploring three complementary directions: (i) scalable and statistically efficient inference; (ii) flexible kernels; and (iii) objective functions for hyperparameter learning alternative to the marginal likelihood. Our approach outperforms all previously reported GP methods on the standard MNIST dataset; performs comparatively to previous kernel-based methods using the RECTANGLES-IMAGE dataset; and breaks the 1% error-rate barrier in GP models using the MNIST8M dataset, showing along the way the scalability of our method at unprecedented scale for GP models (8 million observations) in classification problems. Overall, our approach represents a significant breakthrough in kernel methods and GP models, bridging the gap between deep learning approaches and kernel machines."}
{"text": "  In many security and healthcare systems a sequence of features/sensors/tests are used for detection and diagnosis. Each test outputs a prediction of the latent state, and carries with it inherent costs. Our objective is to {\\it learn} strategies for selecting tests to optimize accuracy \\& costs. Unfortunately it is often impossible to acquire in-situ ground truth annotations and we are left with the problem of unsupervised sensor selection (USS). We pose USS as a version of stochastic partial monitoring problem with an {\\it unusual} reward structure (even noisy annotations are unavailable). Unsurprisingly no learner can achieve sublinear regret without further assumptions. To this end we propose the notion of weak-dominance. This is a condition on the joint probability distribution of test outputs and latent state and says that whenever a test is accurate on an example, a later test in the sequence is likely to be accurate as well. We empirically verify that weak dominance holds on real datasets and prove that it is a maximal condition for achieving sublinear regret. We reduce USS to a special case of multi-armed bandit problem with side information and develop polynomial time algorithms that achieve sublinear regret."}
{"text": "  To improve the performance of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for early detection of diseases using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, we propose \\TheName{} -- a novel framework for \\emph{\\underline{E}HR based \\underline{E}arly \\underline{D}etection of \\underline{D}iseases} on top of \\emph{Covariance-Regularized} LDA models. Specifically, \\TheName\\ employs a \\emph{non-sparse} inverse covariance matrix (or namely precision matrix) estimator derived from graphical lasso and incorporates the estimator into LDA classifiers to improve classification accuracy. Theoretical analysis on \\TheName\\ shows that it can bound the expected error rate of LDA classification, under certain assumptions.

The result shows \\TheName\\ outperforms all baselines and backups our theoretical analysis."}
{"text": "  Federated Learning is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a high-quality centralized model while training data remains distributed over a large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network connections. We consider learning algorithms for this setting where on each round, each client independently computes an update to the current model based on its local data, and communicates this update to a central server, where the client-side updates are aggregated to compute a new global model. The typical clients in this setting are mobile phones, and communication efficiency is of the utmost importance.   In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a random mask; and sketched updates, where we learn a full model update and then compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server. Experiments on both convolutional and recurrent networks show that the proposed methods can reduce the communication cost by two orders of magnitude."}
{"text": "  We provide a theoretical foundation for non-parametric estimation of functions of random variables using kernel mean embeddings. We show that for any continuous function $f$, consistent estimators of the mean embedding of a random variable $X$ lead to consistent estimators of the mean embedding of $f(X)$. For Mat\\'ern kernels and sufficiently smooth functions we also provide rates of convergence. Our results extend to functions of multiple random variables. If the variables are dependent, we require an estimator of the mean embedding of their joint distribution as a starting point; if they are independent, it is sufficient to have separate estimators of the mean embeddings of their marginal distributions. In either case, our results cover both mean embeddings based on i.i.d. samples as well as \"reduced set\" expansions in terms of dependent expansion points. The latter serves as a justification for using such expansions to limit memory resources when applying the approach as a basis for probabilistic programming."}
{"text": "  The determination of cluster centers generally depends on the scale that we use to analyze the data to be clustered. Inappropriate scale usually leads to unreasonable cluster centers and thus unreasonable results. In this study, we first consider the similarity of elements in the data as the connectivity of nodes in an undirected graph, then present the concept of a connection center and regard it as the cluster center of the data. Based on this definition, the determination of cluster centers and the assignment of class are very simple, natural and effective. One more crucial finding is that the cluster centers of different scales can be obtained easily by the different powers of a similarity matrix and the change of power from small to large leads to the dynamic evolution of cluster centers from local (microscopic) to global (microscopic). Further, in this process of evolution, the number of categories changes discontinuously, which means that the presented method can automatically skip the unreasonable number of clusters, suggest appropriate observation scales and provide corresponding cluster results."}
{"text": "  Effective and accurate model selection is an important problem in modern data analysis. One of the major challenges is the computational burden required to handle large data sets that cannot be stored or processed on one machine. Another challenge one may encounter is the presence of outliers and contaminations that damage the inference quality. The parallel \"divide and conquer\" model selection strategy divides the observations of the full data set into roughly equal subsets and perform inference and model selection independently on each subset. After local subset inference, this method aggregates the posterior model probabilities or other model/variable selection criteria to obtain a final model by using the notion of geometric median. This approach leads to improved concentration in finding the \"correct\" model and model parameters and also is provably robust to outliers and data contamination."}
{"text": "  We consider an efficient computational framework for speeding up several machine learning algorithms with almost no loss of accuracy. The proposed framework relies on projections via structured matrices that we call Structured Spinners, which are formed as products of three structured matrix-blocks that incorporate rotations. The approach is highly generic, i.e. i) structured matrices under consideration can either be fully-randomized or learned, ii) our structured family contains as special cases all previously considered structured schemes, iii) the setting extends to the non-linear case where the projections are followed by non-linear functions, and iv) the method finds numerous applications including kernel approximations via random feature maps, dimensionality reduction algorithms, new fast cross-polytope LSH techniques, deep learning, convex optimization algorithms via Newton sketches, quantization with random projection trees, and more. The proposed framework comes with theoretical guarantees characterizing the capacity of the structured model in reference to its unstructured counterpart and is based on a general theoretical principle that we describe in the paper. As a consequence of our theoretical analysis, we provide the first theoretical guarantees for one of the most efficient existing LSH algorithms based on the HD3HD2HD1 structured matrix [Andoni et al., 2015]. The exhaustive experimental evaluation confirms the accuracy and efficiency of structured spinners for a variety of different applications."}
{"text": "  Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful method for blind source separation based on the assumption that sources are statistically independent. Though ICA has proven useful and has been employed in many applications, complete statistical independence can be too restrictive an assumption in practice. Additionally, important prior information about the data, such as sparsity, is usually available. Sparsity is a natural property of the data, a form of diversity, which, if incorporated into the ICA model, can relax the independence assumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance. In this work, we propose a new variant of ICA by entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM)-a flexible, yet parameter-free algorithm-through the direct exploitation of sparsity. Using this new SparseICA-EBM algorithm, we study the synergy of independence and sparsity through simulations on synthetic as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-like data."}
{"text": "  The goal of two-sample tests is to assess whether two samples, $S_P \\sim P^n$ and $S_Q \\sim Q^m$, are drawn from the same distribution. Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis \"$P = Q$\" is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level. As we will show, such Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ. The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST. First, we analyze their main theoretical properties. Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives. Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery."}
{"text": "  Recent advances in Bayesian learning with large-scale data have witnessed emergence of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC), such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian MCMC (SGHMC), and the stochastic gradient thermostat. While finite-time convergence properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In this paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and develop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their asymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric splitting integrator, the {\\em mean square error} (MSE) of the posterior average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$ iterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs are also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method in two large-scale real applications."}
{"text": "  We present a sparse estimation and dictionary learning framework for compressed fiber sensing based on a probabilistic hierarchical sparse model. To handle severe dictionary coherence, selective shrinkage is achieved using a Weibull prior, which can be related to non-convex optimization with $p$-norm constraints for $0 < p < 1$. In addition, we leverage the specific dictionary structure to promote collective shrinkage based on a local similarity model. This is incorporated in form of a kernel function in the joint prior density of the sparse coefficients, thereby establishing a Markov random field-relation. Approximate inference is accomplished using a hybrid technique that combines Hamilton Monte Carlo and Gibbs sampling. To estimate the dictionary parameter, we pursue two strategies, relying on either a deterministic or a probabilistic model for the dictionary parameter. In the first strategy, the parameter is estimated based on alternating estimation. In the second strategy, it is jointly estimated along with the sparse coefficients. The performance is evaluated in comparison to an existing method in various scenarios using simulations and experimental data."}
{"text": "  Gradient matching with Gaussian processes is a promising tool for learning parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODE's). The essence of gradient matching is to model the prior over state variables as a Gaussian process which implies that the joint distribution given the ODE's and GP kernels is also Gaussian distributed. The state-derivatives are integrated out analytically since they are modelled as latent variables. However, the state variables themselves are also latent variables because they are contaminated by noise. Previous work sampled the state variables since integrating them out is \\textit{not} analytically tractable. In this paper we use mean-field approximation to establish tight variational lower bounds that decouple state variables and are therefore, in contrast to the integral over state variables, analytically tractable and even concave for a restricted family of ODE's, including nonlinear and periodic ODE's. Such variational lower bounds facilitate \"hill climbing\" to determine the maximum a posteriori estimate of ODE parameters. An additional advantage of our approach over sampling methods is the determination of a proxy to the intractable posterior distribution over state variables given observations and the ODE's."}
{"text": "  In classification problems when multiples algorithms are applied to different benchmarks a difficult issue arises, i.e., how can we rank the algorithms? In machine learning it is common run the algorithms several times and then a statistic is calculated in terms of means and standard deviations. In order to compare the performance of the algorithms, it is very common to employ statistical tests. However, these tests may also present limitations, since they consider only the means and not the standard deviations of the obtained results. In this paper, we present the so called A-TOPSIS, based on TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), to solve the problem of ranking and comparing classification algorithms in terms of means and standard deviations. We use two case studies to illustrate the A-TOPSIS for ranking classification algorithms and the results show the suitability of A-TOPSIS to rank the algorithms. The presented approach is general and can be applied to compare the performance of stochastic algorithms in machine learning. Finally, to encourage researchers to use the A-TOPSIS for ranking algorithms we also presented in this work an easy-to-use A-TOPSIS web framework."}
{"text": "  Independent component analysis (ICA) is the most popular method for blind source separation (BSS) with a diverse set of applications, such as biomedical signal processing, video and image analysis, and communications. Maximum likelihood (ML), an optimal theoretical framework for ICA, requires knowledge of the true underlying probability density function (PDF) of the latent sources, which, in many applications, is unknown. ICA algorithms cast in the ML framework often deviate from its theoretical optimality properties due to poor estimation of the source PDF. Therefore, accurate estimation of source PDFs is critical in order to avoid model mismatch and poor ICA performance. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient ICA algorithm based on entropy maximization with kernels, (ICA-EMK), which uses both global and local measuring functions as constraints to dynamically estimate the PDF of the sources with reasonable complexity. In addition, the new algorithm performs optimization with respect to each of the cost function gradient directions separately, enabling parallel implementations on multi-core computers. We demonstrate the superior performance of ICA-EMK over competing ICA algorithms using simulated as well as real-world data."}
{"text": "  Due to the recent cases of algorithmic bias in data-driven decision-making, machine learning methods are being put under the microscope in order to understand the root cause of these biases and how to correct them. Here, we consider a basic algorithmic task that is central in machine learning: subsampling from a large data set. Subsamples are used both as an end-goal in data summarization (where fairness could either be a legal, political or moral requirement) and to train algorithms (where biases in the samples are often a source of bias in the resulting model). Consequently, there is a growing effort to modify either the subsampling methods or the algorithms themselves in order to ensure fairness. However, in doing so, a question that seems to be overlooked is whether it is possible to produce fair subsamples that are also adequately representative of the feature space of the data set - an important and classic requirement in machine learning. Can diversity and fairness be simultaneously ensured? We start by noting that, in some applications, guaranteeing one does not necessarily guarantee the other, and a new approach is required. Subsequently, we present an algorithmic framework which allows us to produce both fair and diverse samples. Our experimental results on an image summarization task show marked improvements in fairness without compromising feature diversity by much, giving us the best of both the worlds."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we develop a new sequential regression modeling approach for data streams. Data streams are commonly found around us, e.g in a retail enterprise sales data is continuously collected every day. A demand forecasting model is an important outcome from the data that needs to be continuously updated with the new incoming data. The main challenge in such modeling arises when there is a) high dimensional and sparsity, b) need for an adaptive use of prior knowledge, and/or c) structural changes in the system. The proposed approach addresses these challenges by incorporating an adaptive L1-penalty and inertia terms in the loss function, and thus called Inertial Regularization and Selection (IRS). The former term performs model selection to handle the first challenge while the latter is shown to address the last two challenges. A recursive estimation algorithm is developed, and shown to outperform the commonly used state-space models, such as Kalman Filters, in experimental studies and real data."}
{"text": "  Datasets containing large samples of time-to-event data arising from several small heterogeneous groups are commonly encountered in statistics. This presents problems as they cannot be pooled directly due to their heterogeneity or analyzed individually because of their small sample size. Bayesian nonparametric modelling approaches can be used to model such datasets given their ability to flexibly share information across groups. In this paper, we will compare three popular Bayesian nonparametric methods for modelling the survival functions of heterogeneous groups. Specifically, we will first compare the modelling accuracy of the Dirichlet process, the hierarchical Dirichlet process, and the nested Dirichlet process on simulated datasets of different sizes, where group survival curves differ in shape or in expectation. We, then, will compare the models on a real-world injury dataset."}
{"text": "  We introduce a mixture model for censored durations (C-mix), and develop maximum likelihood inference for the joint estimation of the time distributions and latent regression parameters of the model. We consider a high-dimensional setting, with datasets containing a large number of biomedical covariates. We therefore penalize the negative log-likelihood by the Elastic-Net, which leads to a sparse parameterization of the model. Inference is achieved using an efficient Quasi-Newton Expectation Maximization (QNEM) algorithm, for which we provide convergence properties. We then propose a score by assessing the patients risk of early adverse event. The statistical performance of the method is examined on an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, and finally illustrated on three genetic datasets with high-dimensional covariates. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, namely both the CURE and Cox proportional hazards models for this task, both in terms of C-index and AUC(t)."}
{"text": "  We investigate a general framework of multiplicative multitask feature learning which decomposes each task's model parameters into a multiplication of two components. One of the components is used across all tasks and the other component is task-specific. Several previous methods have been proposed as special cases of our framework. We study the theoretical properties of this framework when different regularization conditions are applied to the two decomposed components. We prove that this framework is mathematically equivalent to the widely used multitask feature learning methods that are based on a joint regularization of all model parameters, but with a more general form of regularizers. Further, an analytical formula is derived for the across-task component as related to the task-specific component for all these regularizers, leading to a better understanding of the shrinkage effect. Study of this framework motivates new multitask learning algorithms. We propose two new learning formulations by varying the parameters in the proposed framework. Empirical studies have revealed the relative advantages of the two new formulations by comparing with the state of the art, which provides instructive insights into the feature learning problem with multiple tasks."}
{"text": "  When a new treatment is considered for use, whether a pharmaceutical drug or a search engine ranking algorithm, a typical question that arises is, will its performance exceed that of the current treatment? The conventional way to answer this counterfactual question is to estimate the effect of the new treatment in comparison to that of the conventional treatment by running a controlled, randomized experiment. While this approach theoretically ensures an unbiased estimator, it suffers from several drawbacks, including the difficulty in finding representative experimental populations as well as the cost of running such trials. Moreover, such trials neglect the huge quantities of available control-condition data which are often completely ignored.   In this paper we propose a discriminative framework for estimating the performance of a new treatment given a large dataset of the control condition and data from a small (and possibly unrepresentative) randomized trial comparing new and old treatments. Our objective, which requires minimal assumptions on the treatments, models the relation between the outcomes of the different conditions. This allows us to not only estimate mean effects but also to generate individual predictions for examples outside the randomized sample.   We demonstrate the utility of our approach through experiments in three areas: Search engine operation, treatments to diabetes patients, and market value estimation for houses. Our results demonstrate that our approach can reduce the number and size of the currently performed randomized controlled experiments, thus saving significant time, money and effort on the part of practitioners."}
{"text": "  We introduce co-occurring directions sketching, a deterministic algorithm for approximate matrix product (AMM), in the streaming model. We show that co-occuring directions achieves a better error bound for AMM than other randomized and deterministic approaches for AMM. Co-occurring directions gives a $1 + \\epsilon$ -approximation of the optimal low rank approximation of a matrix product. Empirically our algorithm outperforms competing methods for AMM, for a small sketch size. We validate empirically our theoretical findings and algorithms"}
{"text": "  The all-relevant problem of feature selection is the identification of all strongly and weakly relevant attributes. This problem is especially hard to solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications such as predictive maintenance or production line optimization, for which each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously. Here, we are proposing an efficient, scalable feature extraction algorithm for time series, which filters the available features in an early stage of the machine learning pipeline with respect to their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well as time series from a production line optimization project and simulated stochastic processes with underlying qualitative change of dynamics."}
{"text": "  We propose a parallelizable sparse inverse formulation Gaussian process (SpInGP) for temporal models. It uses a sparse precision GP formulation and sparse matrix routines to speed up the computations. Due to the state-space formulation used in the algorithm, the time complexity of the basic SpInGP is linear, and because all the computations are parallelizable, the parallel form of the algorithm is sublinear in the number of data points. We provide example algorithms to implement the sparse matrix routines and experimentally test the method using both simulated and real data."}
{"text": "  In this paper we investigate a link between state- space models and Gaussian Processes (GP) for time series modeling and forecasting. In particular, several widely used state- space models are transformed into continuous time form and corresponding Gaussian Process kernels are derived. Experimen- tal results demonstrate that the derived GP kernels are correct and appropriate for Gaussian Process Regression. An experiment with a real world dataset shows that the modeling is identical with state-space models and with the proposed GP kernels. The considered connection allows the researchers to look at their models from a different angle and facilitate sharing ideas between these two different modeling approaches."}
{"text": "  Directed networks are pervasive both in nature and engineered systems, often underlying the complex behavior observed in biological systems, microblogs and social interactions over the web, as well as global financial markets. Since their structures are often unobservable, in order to facilitate network analytics, one generally resorts to approaches capitalizing on measurable nodal processes to infer the unknown topology. Structural equation models (SEMs) are capable of incorporating exogenous inputs to resolve inherent directional ambiguities. However, conventional SEMs assume full knowledge of exogenous inputs, which may not be readily available in some practical settings. The present paper advocates a novel SEM-based topology inference approach that entails factorization of a three-way tensor, constructed from the observed nodal data, using the well-known parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. It turns out that second-order piecewise stationary statistics of exogenous variables suffice to identify the hidden topology. Capitalizing on the uniqueness properties inherent to high-order tensor factorizations, it is shown that topology identification is possible under reasonably mild conditions. In addition, to facilitate real-time operation and inference of time-varying networks, an adaptive (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition scheme which tracks the topology-revealing tensor factors is developed. Extensive tests on simulated and real stock quote data demonstrate the merits of the novel tensor-based approach."}
{"text": "  Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the major public health problems in the world. It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 million. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however, an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If an early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Nonmotor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper, we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper, we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%. Thus, it is concluded that these models can be used for early prediction of Parkinson's disease."}
{"text": "  Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These \"recurrent\" switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable."}
{"text": "  Despite the fundamental nature of the inhomogeneous Poisson process in the theory and application of stochastic processes, and its attractive generalizations (e.g. Cox process), few tractable nonparametric modeling approaches of intensity functions exist, especially when observed points lie in a high-dimensional space. In this paper we develop a new, computationally tractable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) formulation for the inhomogeneous Poisson process. We model the square root of the intensity as an RKHS function. Whereas RKHS models used in supervised learning rely on the so-called representer theorem, the form of the inhomogeneous Poisson process likelihood means that the representer theorem does not apply. However, we prove that the representer theorem does hold in an appropriately transformed RKHS, guaranteeing that the optimization of the penalized likelihood can be cast as a tractable finite-dimensional problem. The resulting approach is simple to implement, and readily scales to high dimensions and large-scale datasets."}
{"text": "  The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been widely used in statistical estimation for large-scale data due to its computational and memory efficiency. While most existing works focus on the convergence of the objective function or the error of the obtained solution, we investigate the problem of statistical inference of true model parameters based on SGD when the population loss function is strongly convex and satisfies certain smoothness conditions. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, in the fixed dimension setup, we propose two consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariance of the average iterate from SGD: (1) a plug-in estimator, and (2) a batch-means estimator, which is computationally more efficient and only uses the iterates from SGD. Both proposed estimators allow us to construct asymptotically exact confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Second, for high-dimensional linear regression, using a variant of the SGD algorithm, we construct a debiased estimator of each regression coefficient that is asymptotically normal. This gives a one-pass algorithm for computing both the sparse regression coefficients and confidence intervals, which is computationally attractive and applicable to online data."}
{"text": "  GPflow is a Gaussian process library that uses TensorFlow for its core computations and Python for its front end.

{"text": "  This paper proposes a subspace decomposition method based on an over-complete dictionary in sparse representation, called \"Sparse Signal Subspace Decomposition\" (or 3SD) method. This method makes use of a novel criterion based on the occurrence frequency of atoms of the dictionary over the data set. This criterion, well adapted to subspace-decomposition over a dependent basis set, adequately re ects the intrinsic characteristic of regularity of the signal. The 3SD method combines variance, sparsity and component frequency criteria into an unified framework. It takes benefits from using an over-complete dictionary which preserves details and from subspace decomposition which rejects strong noise. The 3SD method is very simple with a linear retrieval operation. It does not require any prior knowledge on distributions or parameters. When applied to image denoising, it demonstrates high performances both at preserving fine details and suppressing strong noise."}
{"text": "  Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a popular tool for data exploration. Bayesian NMF promises to also characterize uncertainty in the factorization. Unfortunately, current inference approaches such as MCMC mix slowly and tend to get stuck on single modes. We introduce a novel approach using rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) to asymptotically cover regions of high posterior density. These are placed in a principled Bayesian framework via an online extension to nonparametric variational inference. On experiments on real and synthetic data, we obtain greater coverage of the posterior and higher ELBO values than standard NMF inference approaches."}
{"text": "  Neural networks augmented with external memory have the ability to learn algorithmic solutions to complex tasks. These models appear promising for applications such as language modeling and machine translation. However, they scale poorly in both space and time as the amount of memory grows --- limiting their applicability to real-world domains. Here, we present an end-to-end differentiable memory access scheme, which we call Sparse Access Memory (SAM), that retains the representational power of the original approaches whilst training efficiently with very large memories. We show that SAM achieves asymptotic lower bounds in space and time complexity, and find that an implementation runs $1,\\!000\\times$ faster and with $3,\\!000\\times$ less physical memory than non-sparse models. SAM learns with comparable data efficiency to existing models on a range of synthetic tasks and one-shot Omniglot character recognition, and can scale to tasks requiring $100,\\!000$s of time steps and memories. As well, we show how our approach can be adapted for models that maintain temporal associations between memories, as with the recently introduced Differentiable Neural Computer."}
{"text": "  We propose a geometric algorithm for topic learning and inference that is built on the convex geometry of topics arising from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and its nonparametric extensions. To this end we study the optimization of a geometric loss function, which is a surrogate to the LDA's likelihood. Our method involves a fast optimization based weighted clustering procedure augmented with geometric corrections, which overcomes the computational and statistical inefficiencies encountered by other techniques based on Gibbs sampling and variational inference, while achieving the accuracy comparable to that of a Gibbs sampler. The topic estimates produced by our method are shown to be statistically consistent under some conditions. The algorithm is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated and real data."}

{"text": "  We study the cost function for hierarchical clusterings introduced by [arXiv:1510.05043] where hierarchies are treated as first-class objects rather than deriving their cost from projections into flat clusters. It was also shown in [arXiv:1510.05043] that a top-down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most $O\\left(\\alpha_n \\log n\\right)$ times the cost of the optimal hierarchical clustering, where $\\alpha_n$ is the approximation ratio of the Sparsest Cut subroutine used. Thus using the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao-Vazirani, the top down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most $O\\left(\\log^{3/2} n\\right)$ times the cost of the optimal solution. We improve this by giving an $O(\\log{n})$-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial characterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function, deriving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametrics, and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formulation by using the idea of \\emph{sphere growing} which has been extensively used in the context of graph partitioning. We also prove that our algorithm returns an $O(\\log{n})$-approximate hierarchical clustering for a generalization of this cost function also studied in [arXiv:1510.05043]. Experiments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as well as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage based algorithms. We also give constant factor inapproximability results for this problem."}
{"text": "  We present discriminative Gaifman models, a novel family of relational machine learning models. Gaifman models learn feature representations bottom up from representations of locally connected and bounded-size regions of knowledge bases (KBs). Considering local and bounded-size neighborhoods of knowledge bases renders logical inference and learning tractable, mitigates the problem of overfitting, and facilitates weight sharing. Gaifman models sample neighborhoods of knowledge bases so as to make the learned relational models more robust to missing objects and relations which is a common situation in open-world KBs. We present the core ideas of Gaifman models and apply them to large-scale relational learning problems. We also discuss the ways in which Gaifman models relate to some existing relational machine learning approaches."}
{"text": "  Asynchronous parallel implementations for stochastic optimization have received huge successes in theory and practice recently. Asynchronous implementations with lock-free are more efficient than the one with writing or reading lock. In this paper, we focus on a composite objective function consisting of a smooth convex function $f$ and a block separable convex function, which widely exists in machine learning and computer vision. We propose an asynchronous stochastic block coordinate descent algorithm with the accelerated technology of variance reduction (AsySBCDVR), which are with lock-free in the implementation and analysis. AsySBCDVR is particularly important because it can scale well with the sample size and dimension simultaneously. We prove that AsySBCDVR achieves a linear convergence rate when the function $f$ is with the optimal strong convexity property, and a sublinear rate when $f$ is with the general convexity. More importantly, a near-linear speedup on a parallel system with shared memory can be obtained."}
{"text": "  Regularised canonical correlation analysis was recently extended to more than two sets of variables by the multiblock method Regularised generalised canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA). Further, Sparse GCCA (SGCCA) was proposed to address the issue of variable selection. However, for technical reasons, the variable selection offered by SGCCA was restricted to a covariance link between the blocks (i.e., with $\\tau=1$). One of the main contributions of this paper is to go beyond the covariance link and to propose an extension of SGCCA for the full RGCCA model (i.e., with $\\tau\\in[0, 1]$). In addition, we propose an extension of SGCCA that exploits structural relationships between variables within blocks. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that allows structured and sparsity-inducing penalties to be included in the RGCCA optimisation problem. The proposed multiblock method is illustrated on a real three-block high-grade glioma data set, where the aim is to predict the location of the brain tumours, and on a simulated data set, where the aim is to illustrate the method's ability to reconstruct the true underlying weight vectors."}
{"text": "  We develop a scalable, computationally efficient method for the task of energy disaggregation for home appliance monitoring. In this problem the goal is to estimate the energy consumption of each appliance over time based on the total energy-consumption signal of a household. The current state of the art is to model the problem as inference in factorial HMMs, and use quadratic programming to find an approximate solution to the resulting quadratic integer program. Here we take a more principled approach, better suited to integer programming problems, and find an approximate optimum by combining convex semidefinite relaxations randomized rounding, as well as a scalable ADMM method that exploits the special structure of the resulting semidefinite program. Simulation results both in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method."}
{"text": "  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become the state-of-the-art choice for extracting patterns from temporal sequences. However, current RNN models are ill-suited to process irregularly sampled data triggered by events generated in continuous time by sensors or other neurons. Such data can occur, for example, when the input comes from novel event-driven artificial sensors that generate sparse, asynchronous streams of events or from multiple conventional sensors with different update intervals. In this work, we introduce the Phased LSTM model, which extends the LSTM unit by adding a new time gate. This gate is controlled by a parametrized oscillation with a frequency range that produces updates of the memory cell only during a small percentage of the cycle. Even with the sparse updates imposed by the oscillation, the Phased LSTM network achieves faster convergence than regular LSTMs on tasks which require learning of long sequences. The model naturally integrates inputs from sensors of arbitrary sampling rates, thereby opening new areas of investigation for processing asynchronous sensory events that carry timing information. It also greatly improves the performance of LSTMs in standard RNN applications, and does so with an order-of-magnitude fewer computes at runtime."}
{"text": "  Tensors are higher-order extensions of matrices. While matrix methods form the cornerstone of machine learning and data analysis, tensor methods have been gaining increasing traction.

{"text": "  We study fairness in linear bandit problems. Starting from the notion of meritocratic fairness introduced in Joseph et al. [2016], we carry out a more refined analysis of a more general problem, achieving better performance guarantees with fewer modelling assumptions on the number and structure of available choices as well as the number selected. We also analyze the previously-unstudied question of fairness in infinite linear bandit problems, obtaining instance-dependent regret upper bounds as well as lower bounds demonstrating that this instance-dependence is necessary. The result is a framework for meritocratic fairness in an online linear setting that is substantially more powerful, general, and realistic than the current state of the art."}
{"text": "  Exploiting the fact that most arrival processes exhibit cyclic behaviour, we propose a simple procedure for estimating the intensity of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The estimator is the super-resolution analogue to Shao 2010 and Shao & Lii 2011, which is a sum of $p$ sinusoids where $p$ and the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each wave are not known and need to be estimated. This results in an interpretable yet flexible specification that is suitable for use in modelling as well as in high resolution simulations.   Our estimation procedure sits in between classic periodogram methods and atomic/total variation norm thresholding. Through a novel use of window functions in the point process domain, our approach attains super-resolution without semidefinite programming. Under suitable conditions, finite sample guarantees can be derived for our procedure. These resolve some open questions and expand existing results in spectral estimation literature."}
{"text": "  The remarkable successes of deep learning models across various applications have resulted in the design of deeper networks that can solve complex problems. However, the increasing depth of such models also results in a higher storage and runtime complexity, which restricts the deployability of such very deep models on mobile and portable devices, which have limited storage and battery capacity. While many methods have been proposed for deep model compression in recent years, almost all of them have focused on reducing storage complexity. In this work, we extend the teacher-student framework for deep model compression, since it has the potential to address runtime and train time complexity too. We propose a simple methodology to include a noise-based regularizer while training the student from the teacher, which provides a healthy improvement in the performance of the student network. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST datasets show promising improvement, with the best performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed method under related settings on the CIFAR-10 dataset to show the promise of the proposed approach."}

The methodology leverages copulas for encoding dependence between two variables, state-of-the-art optimal transport for providing a relevant geometry to the copulas, and clustering for summarizing the main dependence patterns found between the variables. Some of the clusters centers can be used to parameterize a novel dependence coefficient which can target or forget specific dependence patterns. Finally, we illustrate and benchmark the methodology on several datasets. Code and numerical experiments are available online for reproducible research."}
{"text": "  Building large models with parameter sharing accounts for most of the success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose doubly convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which significantly improve the performance of CNNs by further exploring this idea. In stead of allocating a set of convolutional filters that are independently learned, a DCNN maintains groups of filters where filters within each group are translated versions of each other. Practically, a DCNN can be easily implemented by a two-step convolution procedure, which is supported by most modern deep learning libraries. We perform extensive experiments on three image classification benchmarks: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and show that DCNNs consistently outperform other competing architectures. We have also verified that replacing a convolutional layer with a doubly convolutional layer at any depth of a CNN can improve its performance. Moreover, various design choices of DCNNs are demonstrated, which shows that DCNN can serve the dual purpose of building more accurate models and/or reducing the memory footprint without sacrificing the accuracy."}
{"text": "  We study a variant of the classical stochastic $K$-armed bandit where observing the outcome of each arm is expensive, but cheap approximations to this outcome are available. For example, in online advertising the performance of an ad can be approximated by displaying it for shorter time periods or to narrower audiences. We formalise this task as a multi-fidelity bandit, where, at each time step, the forecaster may choose to play an arm at any one of $M$ fidelities. The highest fidelity (desired outcome) expends cost $\\lambda^{(m)}$. The $m^{\\text{th}}$ fidelity (an approximation) expends $\\lambda^{(m)} < \\lambda^{(M)}$ and returns a biased estimate of the highest fidelity. We develop MF-UCB, a novel upper confidence bound procedure for this setting and prove that it naturally adapts to the sequence of available approximations and costs thus attaining better regret than naive strategies which ignore the approximations. For instance, in the above online advertising example, MF-UCB would use the lower fidelities to quickly eliminate suboptimal ads and reserve the larger expensive experiments on a small set of promising candidates. We complement this result with a lower bound and show that MF-UCB is nearly optimal under certain conditions."}
{"text": "  The analysis of nonstationary time series is of great importance in many scientific fields such as physics and neuroscience. In recent years, Gaussian process regression has attracted substantial attention as a robust and powerful method for analyzing time series. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing nonstationary time series using locally stationary Gaussian process analysis with parameters that are coupled through a hidden Markov model. The main advantage of this framework is that arbitrary complex nonstationary covariance functions can be obtained by combining simpler stationary building blocks whose hidden parameters can be estimated in closed-form. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by analyzing two examples of synthetic nonstationary signals: oscillations with time varying frequency and time series with two dynamical states. Finally, we report an example application on real magnetoencephalographic measurements of brain activity."}
{"text": "  Learning effective configurations in computer systems without hand-crafting models for every parameter is a long-standing problem. This paper investigates the use of deep reinforcement learning for runtime parameters of cloud databases under latency constraints. Cloud services serve up to thousands of concurrent requests per second and can adjust critical parameters by leveraging performance metrics. In this work, we use continuous deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal cache expirations for HTTP caching in content delivery networks. To this end, we introduce a technique for asynchronous experience management called delayed experience injection, which facilitates delayed reward and next-state computation in concurrent environments where measurements are not immediately available. Evaluation results show that our approach based on normalized advantage functions and asynchronous CPU-only training outperforms a statistical estimator."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of constructing diffusion operators high dimensional data $X$ to address counterfactual functions $F$, such as individualized treatment effectiveness. We propose and construct a new diffusion metric $K_F$ that captures both the local geometry of $X$ and the directions of variance of $F$. The resulting diffusion metric is then used to define a localized filtration of $F$ and answer counterfactual questions pointwise, particularly in situations such as drug trials where an individual patient's outcomes cannot be studied long term both taking and not taking a medication. We validate the model on synthetic and real world clinical trials, and create individualized notions of benefit from treatment."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we investigate the extent to which features derived from bank statements provided by loan applicants, and which are not declared on an application form, can enhance a credit scoring model for a New Zealand lending company. Exploring the potential of such information to improve credit scoring models in this manner has not been studied previously. We construct a baseline model based solely on the existing scoring features obtained from the loan application form, and a second baseline model based solely on the new bank statement-derived features. A combined feature model is then created by augmenting the application form features with the new bank statement derived features. Our experimental results using ROC analysis show that a combined feature model performs better than both of the two baseline models, and show that a number of the bank statement-derived features have value in improving the credit scoring model. The target data set used for modelling was highly imbalanced, and Naive Bayes was found to be the best performing model, and outperformed a number of other classifiers commonly used in credit scoring, suggesting its potential for future use on highly imbalanced data sets."}
{"text": "  We propose a new method of discovering causal relationships in temporal data based on the notion of causal compression. To this end, we adopt the Pearlian graph setting and the directed information as an information theoretic tool for quantifying causality. We introduce chain rule for directed information and use it to motivate causal sparsity. We show two applications of the proposed method: causal time series segmentation which selects time points capturing the incoming and outgoing causal flow between time points belonging to different signals, and causal bipartite graph recovery. We prove that modelling of causality in the adopted set-up only requires estimating the copula density of the data distribution and thus does not depend on its marginals. We evaluate the method on time resolved gene expression data."}

{"text": "  Motivated by the need for distributed learning and optimization algorithms with low communication cost, we study communication efficient algorithms for distributed mean estimation. Unlike previous works, we make no probabilistic assumptions on the data. We first show that for $d$ dimensional data with $n$ clients, a naive stochastic binary rounding approach yields a mean squared error (MSE) of $\\Theta(d/n)$ and uses a constant number of bits per dimension per client. We then extend this naive algorithm in two ways: we show that applying a structured random rotation before quantization reduces the error to $\\mathcal{O}((\\log d)/n)$ and a better coding strategy further reduces the error to $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ and uses a constant number of bits per dimension per client. We also show that the latter coding strategy is optimal up to a constant in the minimax sense i.e., it achieves the best MSE for a given communication cost. We finally demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by applying them to distributed Lloyd's algorithm for k-means and power iteration for PCA."}
{"text": "  In the era of big data, it is common to have data with multiple modalities or coming from multiple sources, known as \"multi-view data\". Multi-view clustering provides a natural way to generate clusters from such data. Since different views share some consistency and complementary information, previous works on multi-view clustering mainly focus on how to combine various numbers of views to improve clustering performance. However, in reality, each view may be incomplete, i.e., instances missing in the view. Furthermore, the size of data could be extremely huge. It is unrealistic to apply multi-view clustering in large real-world applications without considering the incompleteness of views and the memory requirement. None of previous works have addressed all these challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an online multi-view clustering algorithm, OMVC, which deals with large-scale incomplete views. We model the multi-view clustering problem as a joint weighted nonnegative matrix factorization problem and process the multi-view data chunk by chunk to reduce the memory requirement. OMVC learns the latent feature matrices for all the views and pushes them towards a consensus. We further increase the robustness of the learned latent feature matrices in OMVC via lasso regularization. To minimize the influence of incompleteness, dynamic weight setting is introduced to give lower weights to the incoming missing instances in different views. More importantly, to reduce the computational time, we incorporate a faster projected gradient descent by utilizing the Hessian matrices in OMVC. Extensive experiments conducted on four real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OMVC method."}
{"text": "  Kernel dependence measures yield accurate estimates of nonlinear relations between random variables, and they are also endorsed with solid theoretical properties and convergence rates. Besides, the empirical estimates are easy to compute in closed form just involving linear algebra operations. However, they are hampered by two important problems: the high computational cost involved, as two kernel matrices of the sample size have to be computed and stored, and the interpretability of the measure, which remains hidden behind the implicit feature map. We here address these two issues. We introduce the Sensitivity Maps (SMs) for the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Sensitivity maps allow us to explicitly analyze and visualize the relative relevance of both examples and features on the dependence measure. We also present the randomized HSIC (RHSIC) and its corresponding sensitivity maps to cope with large scale problems. We build upon the framework of random features and the Bochner's theorem to approximate the involved kernels in the canonical HSIC. The power of the RHSIC measure scales favourably with the number of samples, and it approximates HSIC and the sensitivity maps efficiently. Convergence bounds of both the measure and the sensitivity map are also provided. Our proposal is illustrated in synthetic examples, and challenging real problems of dependence estimation, feature selection, and causal inference from empirical data."}
{"text": "  Semi-supervised and unsupervised systems provide operators with invaluable support and can tremendously reduce the operators load. In the light of the necessity to process large volumes of video data and provide autonomous decisions, this work proposes new learning algorithms for activity analysis in video. The activities and behaviours are described by a dynamic topic model. Two novel learning algorithms based on the expectation maximisation approach and variational Bayes inference are proposed. Theoretical derivations of the posterior of model parameters are given. The designed learning algorithms are compared with the Gibbs sampling inference scheme introduced earlier in the literature. A detailed comparison of the learning algorithms is presented on real video data. We also propose an anomaly localisation procedure, elegantly embedded in the topic modeling framework. The proposed framework can be applied to a number of areas, including transportation systems, security and surveillance."}

{"text": "  Many machine learning algorithms require precise estimates of covariance matrices. The sample covariance matrix performs poorly in high-dimensional settings, which has stimulated the development of alternative methods, the majority based on factor models and shrinkage. Recent work of Ledoit and Wolf has extended the shrinkage framework to Nonlinear Shrinkage (NLS), a more powerful covariance estimator based on Random Matrix Theory.   Our contribution shows that, contrary to claims in the literature, cross-validation based covariance matrix estimation (CVC) yields comparable performance at strongly reduced complexity and runtime. On two real world data sets, we show that the CVC estimator yields superior results than competing shrinkage and factor based methods."}
{"text": "  We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian model for survival analysis. The model is centred on a parametric baseline hazard, and uses a Gaussian process to model variations away from it nonparametrically, as well as dependence on covariates. As opposed to many other methods in survival analysis, our framework does not impose unnecessary constraints in the hazard rate or in the survival function. Furthermore, our model handles left, right and interval censoring mechanisms common in survival analysis. We propose a MCMC algorithm to perform inference and an approximation scheme based on random Fourier features to make computations faster. We report experimental results on synthetic and real data, showing that our model performs better than competing models such as Cox proportional hazards, ANOVA-DDP and random survival forests."}
{"text": "  Tensor decomposition is an important technique for capturing the high-order interactions among multiway data. Multi-linear tensor composition methods, such as the Tucker decomposition and the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), assume that the complex interactions among objects are multi-linear, and are thus insufficient to represent nonlinear relationships in data. Another assumption of these methods is that a predefined rank should be known. However, the rank of tensors is hard to estimate, especially for cases with missing values. To address these issues, we design a Bayesian generative model for tensor decomposition. Different from the traditional Bayesian methods, the high-order interactions of tensor entries are modeled with variational auto-encoder. The proposed model takes advantages of Neural Networks and nonparametric Bayesian models, by replacing the multi-linear product in traditional Bayesian tensor decomposition with a complex nonlinear function (via Neural Networks) whose parameters can be learned from data. Experimental results on synthetic data and real-world chemometrics tensor data have demonstrated that our new model can achieve significantly higher prediction performance than the state-of-the-art tensor decomposition approaches."}
{"text": "  In this article, we study spectral methods for community detection based on $ \\alpha$-parametrized normalized modularity matrix hereafter called $ {\\bf L}_\\alpha $ in heterogeneous graph models. We show, in a regime where community detection is not asymptotically trivial, that $ {\\bf L}_\\alpha $ can be well approximated by a more tractable random matrix which falls in the family of spiked random matrices. The analysis of this equivalent spiked random matrix allows us to improve spectral methods for community detection and assess their performances in the regime under study. In particular, we prove the existence of an optimal value $ \\alpha_{\\rm opt} $ of the parameter $ \\alpha $ for which the detection of communities is best ensured and we provide an on-line estimation of $ \\alpha_{\\rm opt} $ only based on the knowledge of the graph adjacency matrix. Unlike classical spectral methods for community detection where clustering is performed on the eigenvectors associated with extreme eigenvalues, we show through our theoretical analysis that a regularization should instead be performed on those eigenvectors prior to clustering in heterogeneous graphs. Finally, through a deeper study of the regularized eigenvectors used for clustering, we assess the performances of our new algorithm for community detection. Numerical simulations in the course of the article show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art spectral methods on dense heterogeneous graphs."}

{"text": "  Decision tree (and its extensions such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and Random Forest) is a widely used machine learning algorithm, due to its practical effectiveness and model interpretability. With the emergence of big data, there is an increasing need to parallelize the training process of decision tree. However, most existing attempts along this line suffer from high communication costs. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called \\emph{Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree)}, to tackle this challenge. After partitioning the training data onto a number of (e.g., $M$) machines, this algorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration. For local voting, the top-$k$ attributes are selected from each machine according to its local data. Then, globally top-$2k$ attributes are determined by a majority voting among these local candidates. Finally, the full-grained histograms of the globally top-$2k$ attributes are collected from local machines in order to identify the best (most informative) attribute and its split point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent of the total number of attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal decision tree, since it can find the best attribute with a large probability. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly outperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency."}
{"text": "  Deep networks are successfully used as classification models yielding state-of-the-art results when trained on a large number of labeled samples. These models, however, are usually much less suited for semi-supervised problems because of their tendency to overfit easily when trained on small amounts of data. In this work we will explore a new training objective that is targeting a semi-supervised regime with only a small subset of labeled data. This criterion is based on a deep metric embedding over distance relations within the set of labeled samples, together with constraints over the embeddings of the unlabeled set. The final learned representations are discriminative in euclidean space, and hence can be used with subsequent nearest-neighbor classification using the labeled samples."}
{"text": "  In recent years, model-free methods that use deep learning have achieved great success in many different reinforcement learning environments. Most successful approaches focus on solving a single task, while multi-task reinforcement learning remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a model based approach to deep reinforcement learning which we use to solve different tasks simultaneously. We show that our approach not only does not degrade but actually benefits from learning multiple tasks. For our model, we also present a new kind of recurrent neural network inspired by residual networks that decouples memory from computation allowing to model complex environments that do not require lots of memory."}
{"text": "  Adaptive gradient methods for stochastic optimization adjust the learning rate for each parameter locally. However, there is also a global learning rate which must be tuned in order to get the best performance. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that adapts the learning rate locally for each parameter separately, and also globally for all parameters together. Specifically, we modify Adam, a popular method for training deep learning models, with a coefficient that captures properties of the objective function. Empirically, we show that our method, which we call Eve, outperforms Adam and other popular methods in training deep neural networks, like convolutional neural networks for image classification, and recurrent neural networks for language tasks."}
{"text": "  Code super-optimization is the task of transforming any given program to a more efficient version while preserving its input-output behaviour. In some sense, it is similar to the paraphrase problem from natural language processing where the intention is to change the syntax of an utterance without changing its semantics. Code-optimization has been the subject of years of research that has resulted in the development of rule-based transformation strategies that are used by compilers. More recently, however, a class of stochastic search based methods have been shown to outperform these strategies. This approach involves repeated sampling of modifications to the program from a proposal distribution, which are accepted or rejected based on whether they preserve correctness, and the improvement they achieve. These methods, however, neither learn from past behaviour nor do they try to leverage the semantics of the program under consideration. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel learning based approach for code super-optimization. Intuitively, our method works by learning the proposal distribution using unbiased estimators of the gradient of the expected improvement. Experiments on benchmarks comprising of automatically generated as well as existing (\"Hacker's Delight\") programs show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform state of the art approaches for code super-optimization."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study deep generative models for effective unsupervised learning. We propose VGAN, which works by minimizing a variational lower bound of the negative log likelihood (NLL) of an energy based model (EBM), where the model density $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is approximated by a variational distribution $q(\\mathbf{x})$ that is easy to sample from. The training of VGAN takes a two step procedure: given $p(\\mathbf{x})$, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize the lower bound; $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn from $q(\\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the discriminator and $q(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with several notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs). VGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional space, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also able to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable solutions. \\footnote{Experimental code is available at https://github.com/Shuangfei/vgan}"}
{"text": "  We are surrounded by huge amounts of large-scale high dimensional data. It is desirable to reduce the dimensionality of data for many learning tasks due to the curse of dimensionality. Feature selection has shown its effectiveness in many applications by building simpler and more comprehensive model, improving learning performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. Recently, some unique characteristics of big data such as data velocity and data variety present challenges to the feature selection problem. In this paper, we envision these challenges of feature selection for big data analytics. In particular, we first give a brief introduction about feature selection and then detail the challenges of feature selection for structured, heterogeneous and streaming data as well as its scalability and stability issues. At last, to facilitate and promote the feature selection research, we present an open-source feature selection repository (scikit-feature), which consists of most of current popular feature selection algorithms."}

{"text": "  We develop a first line of attack for solving programming competition-style problems from input-output examples using deep learning. The approach is to train a neural network to predict properties of the program that generated the outputs from the inputs. We use the neural network's predictions to augment search techniques from the programming languages community, including enumerative search and an SMT-based solver. Empirically, we show that our approach leads to an order of magnitude speedup over the strong non-augmented baselines and a Recurrent Neural Network approach, and that we are able to solve problems of difficulty comparable to the simplest problems on programming competition websites."}
{"text": "  Learning over multi-view data is a challenging problem with strong practical applications. Most related studies focus on the classification point of view and assume that all the views are available at any time. We consider an extension of this framework in two directions. First, based on the BiGAN model, the Multi-view BiGAN (MV-BiGAN) is able to perform density estimation from multi-view inputs. Second, it can deal with missing views and is able to update its prediction when additional views are provided. We illustrate these properties on a set of experiments over different datasets."}
{"text": "  We develop a framework for combining differentiable programming languages with neural networks. Using this framework we create end-to-end trainable systems that learn to write interpretable algorithms with perceptual components. We explore the benefits of inductive biases for strong generalization and modularity that come from the program-like structure of our models. In particular, modularity allows us to learn a library of (neural) functions which grows and improves as more tasks are solved. Empirically, we show that this leads to lifelong learning systems that transfer knowledge to new tasks more effectively than baselines."}
{"text": "  At present, designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures requires both human expertise and labor. New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks."}
{"text": "  We present a novel layerwise optimization algorithm for the learning objective of Piecewise-Linear Convolutional Neural Networks (PL-CNNs), a large class of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, PL-CNNs employ piecewise linear non-linearities such as the commonly used ReLU and max-pool, and an SVM classifier as the final layer. The key observation of our approach is that the problem corresponding to the parameter estimation of a layer can be formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) program, which happens to be a latent structured SVM. We optimize the DC program using the concave-convex procedure, which requires us to iteratively solve a structured SVM problem. This allows to design an optimization algorithm with an optimal learning rate that does not require any tuning. Using the MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet data sets, we show that our approach always improves over the state of the art variants of backpropagation and scales to large data and large network settings."}

We present a general-purpose framework for distributed computing environments, CoCoA, that has an efficient communication scheme and is applicable to a wide variety of problems in machine learning and signal processing. We extend the framework to cover general non-strongly-convex regularizers, including L1-regularized problems like lasso, sparse logistic regression, and elastic net regularization, and show how earlier work can be derived as a special case. We provide convergence guarantees for the class of convex regularized loss minimization objectives, leveraging a novel approach in handling non-strongly-convex regularizers and non-smooth loss functions. The resulting framework has markedly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods, as we illustrate with an extensive set of experiments on real distributed datasets."}
{"text": "  Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's MuJoCo continuous control environments."}
{"text": "  Game theory finds nowadays a broad range of applications in engineering and machine learning. However, in a derivative-free, expensive black-box context, very few algorithmic solutions are available to find game equilibria. Here, we propose a novel Gaussian-process based approach for solving games in this context. We follow a classical Bayesian optimization framework, with sequential sampling decisions based on acquisition functions. Two strategies are proposed, based either on the probability of achieving equilibrium or on the Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction paradigm. Practical and numerical aspects are discussed in order to enhance the scalability and reduce computation time. Our approach is evaluated on several synthetic game problems with varying number of players and decision space dimensions. We show that equilibria can be found reliably for a fraction of the cost (in terms of black-box evaluations) compared to classical, derivative-based algorithms. The method is available in the R package GPGame available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=GPGame."}
{"text": "  Embedding and visualizing large-scale high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space is an important problem since such visualization can reveal deep insights out of complex data. Most of the existing embedding approaches, however, run on an excessively high precision, ignoring the fact that at the end, embedding outputs are converted into coarse-grained discrete pixel coordinates in a screen space. Motivated by such an observation and directly considering pixel coordinates in an embedding optimization process, we accelerate Barnes-Hut tree-based t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (BH-SNE), known as a state-of-the-art 2D embedding method, and propose a novel method called PixelSNE, a highly-efficient, screen resolution-driven 2D embedding method with a linear computational complexity in terms of the number of data items. Our experimental results show the significantly fast running time of PixelSNE by a large margin against BH-SNE, while maintaining the minimal degradation in the embedding quality.

{"text": "  An intriguing property of deep neural networks is the existence of adversarial examples, which can transfer among different architectures. These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system."}
{"text": "  There has been a growing interest for Wireless Distributed Computing (WDC), which leverages collaborative computing over multiple wireless devices. WDC enables complex applications that a single device cannot support individually. However, the problem of assigning tasks over multiple devices becomes challenging in the dynamic environments encountered in real-world settings, considering that the resource availability and channel conditions change over time in unpredictable ways due to mobility and other factors. In this paper, we formulate a task assignment problem as an online learning problem using an adversarial multi-armed bandit framework. We propose MABSTA, a novel online learning algorithm that learns the performance of unknown devices and channel qualities continually through exploratory probing and makes task assignment decisions by exploiting the gained knowledge. For maximal adaptability, MABSTA is designed to make no stochastic assumption about the environment. We analyze it mathematically and provide a worst-case performance guarantee for any dynamic environment. We also compare it with the optimal offline policy as well as other baselines via emulations on trace-data obtained from a wireless IoT testbed, and show that it offers competitive and robust performance in all cases. To the best of our knowledge, MABSTA is the first online algorithm in this domain of task assignment problems and provides provable performance guarantee."}
{"text": "  We initiate the study of fairness in reinforcement learning, where the actions of a learning algorithm may affect its environment and future rewards. Our fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never prefers one action over another if the long-term (discounted) reward of choosing the latter action is higher. Our first result is negative: despite the fact that fairness is consistent with the optimal policy, any learning algorithm satisfying fairness must take time exponential in the number of states to achieve non-trivial approximation to the optimal policy. We then provide a provably fair polynomial time algorithm under an approximate notion of fairness, thus establishing an exponential gap between exact and approximate fairness"}
{"text": "  Learning representations of data, and in particular learning features for a subsequent prediction task, has been a fruitful area of research delivering impressive empirical results in recent years. However, relatively little is understood about what makes a representation `good'. We propose the idea of a risk gap induced by representation learning for a given prediction context, which measures the difference in the risk of some learner using the learned features as compared to the original inputs. We describe a set of sufficient conditions for unsupervised representation learning to provide a benefit, as measured by this risk gap. These conditions decompose the problem of when representation learning works into its constituent parts, which can be separately evaluated using an unlabeled sample, suitable domain-specific assumptions about the joint distribution, and analysis of the feature learner and subsequent supervised learner. We provide two examples of such conditions in the context of specific properties of the unlabeled distribution, namely when the data lies close to a low-dimensional manifold and when it forms clusters. We compare our approach to a recently proposed analysis of semi-supervised learning."}
{"text": "  To sidestep the curse of dimensionality when computing solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations (HJB PDE), we propose an algorithm that leverages a neural network to approximate the value function. We show that our final approximation of the value function generates near optimal controls which are guaranteed to successfully drive the system to a target state. Our framework is not dependent on state space discretization, leading to a significant reduction in computation time and space complexity in comparison with dynamic programming-based approaches. Using this grid-free approach also enables us to plan over longer time horizons with relatively little additional computation overhead. Unlike many previous neural network HJB PDE approximating formulations, our approximation is strictly conservative and hence any trajectories we generate will be strictly feasible. For demonstration, we specialize our new general framework to the Dubins car model and discuss how the framework can be applied to other models with higher-dimensional state spaces."}
{"text": "  Convolutional neural networks excel in image recognition tasks, but this comes at the cost of high computational and memory complexity. To tackle this problem, [1] developed a tensor factorization framework to compress fully-connected layers. In this paper, we focus on compressing convolutional layers. We show that while the direct application of the tensor framework [1] to the 4-dimensional kernel of convolution does compress the layer, we can do better. We reshape the convolutional kernel into a tensor of higher order and factorize it. We combine the proposed approach with the previous work to compress both convolutional and fully-connected layers of a network and achieve 80x network compression rate with 1.1% accuracy drop on the CIFAR-10 dataset."}
{"text": "  Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training.   Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice.   We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models."}
{"text": "  The vision for precision medicine is to use individual patient characteristics to inform a personalized treatment plan that leads to the best healthcare possible for each patient. Mobile technologies have an important role to play in this vision as they offer a means to monitor a patient's health status in real-time and subsequently to deliver interventions if, when, and in the dose that they are needed. Dynamic treatment regimes formalize individualized treatment plans as sequences of decision rules, one per stage of clinical intervention, that map current patient information to a recommended treatment. However, existing methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes are designed for a small number of fixed decision points occurring on a coarse time-scale. We propose a new reinforcement learning method for estimating an optimal treatment regime that is applicable to data collected using mobile technologies in an outpatient setting. The proposed method accommodates an indefinite time horizon and minute-by-minute decision making that are common in mobile health applications. We show the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. The proposed methods are applied to estimate an optimal dynamic treatment regime for controlling blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes."}
{"text": "  In this paper we present the greedy step averaging(GSA) method, a parameter-free stochastic optimization algorithm for a variety of machine learning problems. As a gradient-based optimization method, GSA makes use of the information from the minimizer of a single sample's loss function, and takes average strategy to calculate reasonable learning rate sequence. While most existing gradient-based algorithms introduce an increasing number of hyper parameters or try to make a trade-off between computational cost and convergence rate, GSA avoids the manual tuning of learning rate and brings in no more hyper parameters or extra cost. We perform exhaustive numerical experiments for logistic and softmax regression to compare our method with the other state of the art ones on 16 datasets. Results show that GSA is robust on various scenarios."}

We compare Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and sparse Autoencoder to a baseline method where the data are only centered and scaled, on each of two models: Linear Regression and Regression Tree. We find that unsupervised learning techniques significantly improve the prediction accuracy on both models. For the Linear Regression model, sparse Autoencoder achieves the best result, with an improvement in the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the test set of 42% over the baseline method. For the Regression Tree model, PCA achieves the best result, with an improvement in RMSE of 15% over the baseline."}
{"text": "  Organ transplants can improve the life expectancy and quality of life for the recipient but carries the risk of serious post-operative complications, such as septic shock and organ rejection. The probability of a successful transplant depends in a very subtle fashion on compatibility between the donor and the recipient but current medical practice is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex nature of recipient-donor compatibility. Hence a data-driven approach for learning compatibility has the potential for significant improvements in match quality. This paper proposes a novel system (ConfidentMatch) that is trained using data from electronic health records. ConfidentMatch predicts the success of an organ transplant (in terms of the 3 year survival rates) on the basis of clinical and demographic traits of the donor and recipient. ConfidentMatch captures the heterogeneity of the donor and recipient traits by optimally dividing the feature space into clusters and constructing different optimal predictive models to each cluster. The system controls the complexity of the learned predictive model in a way that allows for assuring more granular and confident predictions for a larger number of potential recipient-donor pairs, thereby ensuring that predictions are \"personalized\" and tailored to individual characteristics to the finest possible granularity. Experiments conducted on the UNOS heart transplant dataset show the superiority of the prognostic value of ConfidentMatch to other competing benchmarks; ConfidentMatch can provide predictions of success with 95% confidence for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients, which corresponds to 410 more patients than the most competitive benchmark algorithm (DeepBoost)."}

These questions have been considered in past literature, but only under specific assumptions about the decay, typically polynomial, of the spectrum of the the kernel mapping covariance operator.

{"text": "  Surgical Site Infection (SSI) is a national priority in healthcare research. Much research attention has been attracted to develop better SSI risk prediction models. However, most of the existing SSI risk prediction models are built on static risk factors such as comorbidities and operative factors. In this paper, we investigate the use of the dynamic wound data for SSI risk prediction. There have been emerging mobile health (mHealth) tools that can closely monitor the patients and generate continuous measurements of many wound-related variables and other evolving clinical variables. Since existing prediction models of SSI have quite limited capacity to utilize the evolving clinical data, we develop the corresponding solution to equip these mHealth tools with decision-making capabilities for SSI prediction with a seamless assembly of several machine learning models to tackle the analytic challenges arising from the spatial-temporal data. The basic idea is to exploit the low-rank property of the spatial-temporal data via the bilinear formulation, and further enhance it with automatic missing data imputation by the matrix completion technique. We derive efficient optimization algorithms to implement these models and demonstrate the superior performances of our new predictive model on a real-world dataset of SSI, compared to a range of state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  Spectral dimensionality reduction is frequently used to identify low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data. However, learning manifolds, especially from the streaming data, is computationally and memory expensive. In this paper, we argue that a stable manifold can be learned using only a fraction of the stream, and the remaining stream can be mapped to the manifold in a significantly less costly manner. Identifying the transition point at which the manifold is stable is the key step. We present error metrics that allow us to identify the transition point for a given stream by quantitatively assessing the quality of a manifold learned using Isomap. We further propose an efficient mapping algorithm, called S-Isomap, that can be used to map new samples onto the stable manifold. We describe experiments on a variety of data sets that show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy."}

One example in machine learning is hyper-parameter optimization where each evaluation of the target function requires training a model which may involve days or even weeks of computation. Most methods for this so-called \"Bayesian optimization\" only allow sequential exploration of the parameter space. However, it is often desirable to propose batches or sets of parameter values to explore simultaneously, especially when there are large parallel processing facilities at our disposal. Batch methods require modeling the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new approach for parallelizing Bayesian optimization by modeling the diversity of a batch via Determinantal point processes (DPPs) whose kernels are learned automatically. This allows us to generalize a previous result as well as prove better regret bounds based on DPP sampling. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world robotics and hyper-parameter optimization tasks indicate that our DPP-based methods, especially those based on DPP sampling, outperform state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  It has been proposed that complex populations, such as those that arise in genomics studies, may exhibit dependencies among observations as well as among variables. This gives rise to the challenging problem of analyzing unreplicated high-dimensional data with unknown mean and dependence structures. Matrix-variate approaches that impose various forms of (inverse) covariance sparsity allow flexible dependence structures to be estimated, but cannot directly be applied when the mean and covariance matrices are estimated jointly. We present a practical method utilizing generalized least squares and penalized (inverse) covariance estimation to address this challenge. We establish consistency and obtain rates of convergence for estimating the mean parameters and covariance matrices. The advantages of our approaches are: (i) dependence graphs and covariance structures can be estimated in the presence of unknown mean structure, (ii) the mean structure becomes more efficiently estimated when accounting for the dependence structure among observations; and (iii) inferences about the mean parameters become correctly calibrated. We use simulation studies and analysis of genomic data from a twin study of ulcerative colitis to illustrate the statistical convergence and the performance of our methods in practical settings. Several lines of evidence show that the test statistics for differential gene expression produced by our methods are correctly calibrated and improve power over conventional methods."}
{"text": "  The \"fire together, wire together\" Hebbian model is a central principle for learning in neuroscience, but surprisingly, it has found limited applicability in modern machine learning. In this paper, we take a first step towards bridging this gap, by developing flavors of competitive Hebbian learning which produce sparse, distributed neural codes using online adaptation with minimal tuning. We propose an unsupervised algorithm, termed Adaptive Hebbian Learning (AHL). We illustrate the distributed nature of the learned representations via output entropy computations for synthetic data, and demonstrate superior performance, compared to standard alternatives such as autoencoders, in training a deep convolutional net on standard image datasets."}
{"text": "  The past several years have seen remarkable progress in generative models which produce convincing samples of images and other modalities. A shared component of many powerful generative models is a decoder network, a parametric deep neural net that defines a generative distribution. Examples include variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and generative moment matching networks. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to quantify the performance of these models because of the intractability of log-likelihood estimation, and inspecting samples can be misleading. We propose to use Annealed Importance Sampling for evaluating log-likelihoods for decoder-based models and validate its accuracy using bidirectional Monte Carlo. The evaluation code is provided at https://github.com/tonywu95/eval_gen. Using this technique, we analyze the performance of decoder-based models, the effectiveness of existing log-likelihood estimators, the degree of overfitting, and the degree to which these models miss important modes of the data distribution."}
{"text": "  We present Earliness-Aware Deep Convolutional Networks (EA-ConvNets), an end-to-end deep learning framework, for early classification of time series data. Unlike most existing methods for early classification of time series data, that are designed to solve this problem under the assumption of the availability of a good set of pre-defined (often hand-crafted) features, our framework can jointly perform feature learning (by learning a deep hierarchy of \\emph{shapelets} capturing the salient characteristics in each time series), along with a dynamic truncation model to help our deep feature learning architecture focus on the early parts of each time series. Consequently, our framework is able to make highly reliable early predictions, outperforming various state-of-the-art methods for early time series classification, while also being competitive when compared to the state-of-the-art time series classification algorithms that work with \\emph{fully observed} time series data. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first to perform data-driven (deep) feature learning in the context of early classification of time series data. We perform a comprehensive set of experiments, on several benchmark data sets, which demonstrate that our method yields significantly better predictions than various state-of-the-art methods designed for early time series classification. In addition to obtaining high accuracies, our experiments also show that the learned deep shapelets based features are also highly interpretable and can help gain better understanding of the underlying characteristics of time series data."}
{"text": "  Training time on large datasets for deep neural networks is the principal workflow bottleneck in a number of important applications of deep learning, such as object classification and detection in automatic driver assistance systems (ADAS). To minimize training time, the training of a deep neural network must be scaled beyond a single machine to as many machines as possible by distributing the optimization method used for training. While a number of approaches have been proposed for distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD), at the current time synchronous approaches to distributed SGD appear to be showing the greatest performance at large scale. Synchronous scaling of SGD suffers from the need to synchronize all processors on each gradient step and is not resilient in the face of failing or lagging processors. In asynchronous approaches using parameter servers, training is slowed by contention to the parameter server. In this paper we compare the convergence of synchronous and asynchronous SGD for training a modern ResNet network architecture on the ImageNet classification problem. We also propose an asynchronous method, gossiping SGD, that aims to retain the positive features of both systems by replacing the all-reduce collective operation of synchronous training with a gossip aggregation algorithm. We find, perhaps counterintuitively, that asynchronous SGD, including both elastic averaging and gossiping, converges faster at fewer nodes (up to about 32 nodes), whereas synchronous SGD scales better to more nodes (up to about 100 nodes)."}
{"text": "  Modern technologies are producing datasets with complex intrinsic structures, and they can be naturally represented as matrices instead of vectors. To preserve the latent data structures during processing, modern regression approaches incorporate the low-rank property to the model and achieve satisfactory performance for certain applications. These approaches all assume that both predictors and labels for each pair of data within the training set are accurate. However, in real-world applications, it is common to see the training data contaminated by noises, which can affect the robustness of these matrix regression methods. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel robust matrix regression method. We also derive efficient proximal algorithms for model training. To evaluate the performance of our methods, we apply it to real world applications with comparative studies. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which shows the effectiveness and the practical value of our method."}
{"text": "  The ability to track a moving vehicle is of crucial importance in numerous applications. The task has often been approached by the importance sampling technique of particle filters due to its ability to model non-linear and non-Gaussian dynamics, of which a vehicle travelling on a road network is a good example. Particle filters perform poorly when observations are highly informative. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing particle filters that sample around the most recent observation. The proposal leads to an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy and efficiency over conventional particle filters, especially when observations are infrequent but low-noise."}
{"text": "  In a semi-supervised learning scenario, (possibly noisy) partially observed labels are used as input to train a classifier, in order to assign labels to unclassified samples. In this paper, we study this classifier learning problem from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. Specifically, by viewing a binary classifier as a piecewise constant graph-signal in a high-dimensional feature space, we cast classifier learning as a signal restoration problem via a classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Unlike previous graph-signal restoration works, we consider in addition edges with negative weights that signify anti-correlation between samples. One unfortunate consequence is that the graph Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ can be indefinite, and previously proposed graph-signal smoothness prior $\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{x}$ for candidate signal $\\mathbf{x}$ can lead to pathological solutions. In response, we derive an optimal perturbation matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ - based on a fast lower-bound computation of the minimum eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{L}$ via a novel application of the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula---so that $\\mathbf{L} + \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ is positive semi-definite, resulting in a stable signal prior. Further, instead of forcing a hard binary decision for each sample, we define the notion of generalized smoothness on graph that promotes ambiguity in the classifier signal. Finally, we propose an algorithm based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) that solves the posed MAP problem efficiently. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms both SVM variants and graph-based classifiers using positive-edge graphs noticeably."}
{"text": "  Natural image modeling is a landmark challenge of unsupervised learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a useful latent representation and model global structure well but have difficulty capturing small details. PixelCNN models details very well, but lacks a latent code and is difficult to scale for capturing large structures. We present PixelVAE, a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN. Our model requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure. Finally, we extend our model to a hierarchy of latent variables at different scales. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64x64 ImageNet, and high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset."}
{"text": "  We analyze online \\cite{BottouBengio} and mini-batch \\cite{Sculley} $k$-means variants. Both scale up the widely used $k$-means algorithm via stochastic approximation, and have become popular for large-scale clustering and unsupervised feature learning. We show, for the first time, that starting with any initial solution, they converge to a \"local optimum\" at rate $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ (in terms of the $k$-means objective) under general conditions. In addition, we show if the dataset is clusterable, when initialized with a simple and scalable seeding algorithm, mini-batch $k$-means converges to an optimal $k$-means solution at rate $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ with high probability. The $k$-means objective is non-convex and non-differentiable: we exploit ideas from recent work on stochastic gradient descent for non-convex problems \\cite{ge:sgd_tensor, balsubramani13} by providing a novel characterization of the trajectory of $k$-means algorithm on its solution space, and circumvent the non-differentiability problem via geometric insights about $k$-means update."}
{"text": "  We describe a method for searching the optimal hyper-parameters in reservoir computing, which consists of a Gaussian process with Bayesian optimization. It provides an alternative to other frequently used optimization methods such as grid, random, or manual search. In addition to a set of optimal hyper-parameters, the method also provides a probability distribution of the cost function as a function of the hyper-parameters. We apply this method to two types of reservoirs: nonlinear delay nodes and echo state networks. It shows excellent performance on all considered benchmarks, either matching or significantly surpassing results found in the literature. In general, the algorithm achieves optimal results in fewer iterations when compared to other optimization methods. We have optimized up to six hyper-parameters simultaneously, which would have been infeasible using, e.g., grid search. Due to its automated nature, this method significantly reduces the need for expert knowledge when optimizing the hyper-parameters in reservoir computing. Existing software libraries for Bayesian optimization, such as Spearmint, make the implementation of the algorithm straightforward. A fork of the Spearmint framework along with a tutorial on how to use it in practice is available at https://bitbucket.org/uhasseltmachinelearning/spearmint/"}

We propose a method to aggregate noisy labels collected from a crowd of workers or annotators. Eliciting labels is important in tasks such as judging web search quality and rating products. Our method assumes that labels are generated by a probability distribution over items and labels. We formulate the method by drawing parallels between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and show that the problem of vote aggregation can be viewed as one of clustering. We use K-RBMs to perform clustering. We finally show some empirical evaluations over real datasets."}
{"text": "  In this paper we combine two important extensions of ordinary least squares regression: regularization and optimal scaling. Optimal scaling (sometimes also called optimal scoring) has originally been developed for categorical data, and the process finds quantifications for the categories that are optimal for the regression model in the sense that they maximize the multiple correlation. Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types; typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline) functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted to be monotonic, preserving the ordinal information in the data. In addition to optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge regression, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net. The resulting method will be called ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the basic OS algorithm provides straightforward and efficient estimation of the regularized regression coefficients, automatically gives the Group Lasso and Blockwise Sparse Regression, and extends them with monotonicity properties. We will show that Optimal Scaling linearizes nonlinear relationships between predictors and outcome, and improves upon the condition of the predictor correlation matrix, increasing (on average) the conditional independence of the predictors. Alternative options for regularization of either regression coefficients or category quantifications are mentioned. Extended examples are provided.   Keywords: Categorical Data, Optimal Scaling, Conditional Independence, Step Functions, Splines, Monotonic Transformations, Regularization, Lasso, Elastic Net, Group Lasso, Blockwise Sparse Regression."}
{"text": "  Learning hash functions/codes for similarity search over multi-view data is attracting increasing attention, where similar hash codes are assigned to the data objects characterizing consistently neighborhood relationship across views. Traditional methods in this category inherently suffer three limitations: 1) they commonly adopt a two-stage scheme where similarity matrix is first constructed, followed by a subsequent hash function learning; 2) these methods are commonly developed on the assumption that data samples with multiple representations are noise-free,which is not practical in real-life applications; 3) they often incur cumbersome training model caused by the neighborhood graph construction using all $N$ points in the database ($O(N)$). In this paper, we motivate the problem of jointly and efficiently training the robust hash functions over data objects with multi-feature representations which may be noise corrupted. To achieve both the robustness and training efficiency, we propose an approach to effectively and efficiently learning low-rank kernelized \\footnote{We use kernelized similarity rather than kernel, as it is not a squared symmetric matrix for data-landmark affinity matrix.} hash functions shared across views. Specifically, we utilize landmark graphs to construct tractable similarity matrices in multi-views to automatically discover neighborhood structure in the data. To learn robust hash functions, a latent low-rank kernel function is used to construct hash functions in order to accommodate linearly inseparable data. In particular, a latent kernelized similarity matrix is recovered by rank minimization on multiple kernel-based similarity matrices. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets validate the efficacy of our method in the presence of error corruptions."}
{"text": "  Co-clustering targets on grouping the samples (e.g., documents, users) and the features (e.g., words, ratings) simultaneously. It employs the dual relation and the bilateral information between the samples and features. In many realworld applications, data usually reside on a submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space, but it is nontrivial to estimate the intrinsic manifold of the data space in a principled way. In this study, we focus on improving the co-clustering performance via manifold ensemble learning, which is able to maximally approximate the intrinsic manifolds of both the sample and feature spaces. To achieve this, we develop a novel co-clustering algorithm called Relational Multi-manifold Co-clustering (RMC) based on symmetric nonnegative matrix tri-factorization, which decomposes the relational data matrix into three submatrices. This method considers the intertype relationship revealed by the relational data matrix, and also the intra-type information reflected by the affinity matrices encoded on the sample and feature data distributions. Specifically, we assume the intrinsic manifold of the sample or feature space lies in a convex hull of some pre-defined candidate manifolds. We want to learn a convex combination of them to maximally approach the desired intrinsic manifold. To optimize the objective function, the multiplicative rules are utilized to update the submatrices alternatively. Besides, both the entropic mirror descent algorithm and the coordinate descent algorithm are exploited to learn the manifold coefficient vector. Extensive experiments on documents, images and gene expression data sets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to other well-established methods."}
{"text": "  We propose a method for finding alternate features missing in the Lasso optimal solution. In ordinary Lasso problem, one global optimum is obtained and the resulting features are interpreted as task-relevant features. However, this can overlook possibly relevant features not selected by the Lasso. With the proposed method, we can provide not only the Lasso optimal solution but also possible alternate features to the Lasso solution. We show that such alternate features can be computed efficiently by avoiding redundant computations. We also demonstrate how the proposed method works in the 20 newsgroup data, which shows that reasonable features are found as alternate features."}

{"text": "  Despite the great successes of deep learning, the effectiveness of deep neural networks has not been understood at any theoretical depth. This work is motivated by the thrust of developing a deeper understanding of recurrent neural networks, particularly LSTM/GRU-like networks. As the highly complex structure of the recurrent unit in LSTM and GRU networks makes them difficult to analyze, our methodology in this research theme is to construct an alternative recurrent unit that is as simple as possible and yet also captures the key components of LSTM/GRU recurrent units. Such a unit can then be used for the study of recurrent networks and its structural simplicity may allow easier analysis. Towards that goal, we take a system-theoretic perspective to design a new recurrent unit, which we call the prototypical recurrent unit (PRU). Not only having minimal complexity, PRU is demonstrated experimentally to have comparable performance to GRU and LSTM unit. This establishes PRU networks as a prototype for future study of LSTM/GRU-like recurrent networks. This paper also studies the memorization abilities of LSTM, GRU and PRU networks, motivated by the folk belief that such networks possess long-term memory. For this purpose, we design a simple and controllable task, called ``memorization problem'', where the networks are trained to memorize certain targeted information. We show that the memorization performance of all three networks depends on the amount of targeted information, the amount of ``interfering\" information, and the state space dimension of the recurrent unit. Experiments are also performed for another controllable task, the adding problem, and similar conclusions are obtained."}
{"text": "  This work brings together two powerful concepts in Gaussian processes: the variational approach to sparse approximation and the spectral representation of Gaussian processes. This gives rise to an approximation that inherits the benefits of the variational approach but with the representational power and computational scalability of spectral representations. The work hinges on a key result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances. We derive these expressions for Matern kernels in one dimension, and generalize to more dimensions using kernels with specific structures. Under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise, our method requires only a single pass through the dataset, making for very fast and accurate computation. We fit a model to 4 million training points in just a few minutes on a standard laptop. With non-conjugate likelihoods, our MCMC scheme reduces the cost of computation from O(NM2) (for a sparse Gaussian process) to O(NM) per iteration, where N is the number of data and M is the number of features."}
{"text": "  Over the years, ensemble methods have become a staple of machine learning. Similarly, generalized linear models (GLMs) have become very popular for a wide variety of statistical inference tasks. The former have been shown to enhance out- of-sample predictive power and the latter possess easy interpretability. Recently, ensembles of GLMs have been proposed as a possibility. On the downside, this approach loses the interpretability that GLMs possess. We show that minimum description length (MDL)-motivated compression of the inferred ensembles can be used to recover interpretability without much, if any, downside to performance and illustrate on a number of standard classification data sets."}
{"text": "  There is a widespread need for techniques that can discover structure from time series data. Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to find structure within a single time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of temporal patterns, it is difficult to extend and can be brittle in practice. This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii) represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in Venture. The paper demonstrates an application to time series clustering that involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over both non-parametric and standard regression baselines."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of estimating the expected value of information (the knowledge gradient) for Bayesian learning problems where the belief model is nonlinear in the parameters. Our goal is to maximize some metric, while simultaneously learning the unknown parameters of the nonlinear belief model, by guiding a sequential experimentation process which is expensive. We overcome the problem of computing the expected value of an experiment, which is computationally intractable, by using a sampled approximation, which helps to guide experiments but does not provide an accurate estimate of the unknown parameters. We then introduce a resampling process which allows the sampled model to adapt to new information, exploiting past experiments. We show theoretically that the method converges asymptotically to the true parameters, while simultaneously maximizing our metric. We show empirically that the process exhibits rapid convergence, yielding good results with a very small number of experiments."}
{"text": "  Discrimination discovery and prevention/removal are increasingly important tasks in data mining. Discrimination discovery aims to unveil discriminatory practices on the protected attribute (e.g., gender) by analyzing the dataset of historical decision records, and discrimination prevention aims to remove discrimination by modifying the biased data before conducting predictive analysis. In this paper, we show that the key to discrimination discovery and prevention is to find the meaningful partitions that can be used to provide quantitative evidences for the judgment of discrimination. With the support of the causal graph, we present a graphical condition for identifying a meaningful partition. Based on that, we develop a simple criterion for the claim of non-discrimination, and propose discrimination removal algorithms which accurately remove discrimination while retaining good data utility. Experiments using real datasets show the effectiveness of our approaches."}

More specifically, we establish a new framework for generating dependent Indian buffet processes, where the Poisson random field model from population genetics is used as a way of constructing dependent beta processes. Inference in the model is complex, and we describe a sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for exact posterior simulation.

Then we model direct and indirect discrimination as the path-specific effects, which explicitly distinguish the two types of discrimination as the causal effects transmitted along different paths in the network. Based on that, we propose an effective algorithm for discovering direct and indirect discrimination, as well as an algorithm for precisely removing both types of discrimination while retaining good data utility. Different from previous works, our approaches can ensure that the predictive models built from the modified data will not incur discrimination in decision making. Experiments using real datasets show the effectiveness of our approaches."}
{"text": "  The k-fold cross-validation is commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of SVMs with the selected hyper-parameters. It is known that the SVM k-fold cross-validation is expensive, since it requires training k SVMs. However, little work has explored reusing the h-th SVM for training the (h+1)-th SVM for improving the efficiency of k-fold cross-validation. In this paper, we propose three algorithms that reuse the h-th SVM for improving the efficiency of training the (h+1)-th SVM. Our key idea is to efficiently identify the support vectors and to accurately estimate their associated weights (also called alpha values) of the next SVM by using the previous SVM. Our experimental results show that our algorithms are several times faster than the k-fold cross-validation which does not make use of the previously trained SVM. Moreover, our algorithms produce the same results (hence same accuracy) as the k-fold cross-validation which does not make use of the previously trained SVM."}

We formulate this as a problem of learning a decision list -- a sequence of if-then-else rules -- which maps characteristics of subjects (eg., diagnostic test results of patients) to treatments. We propose a novel objective to construct a decision list which maximizes outcomes for the population, and minimizes overall costs. We model the problem of learning such a list as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a variant of the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy which leverages customized checks for pruning the search space effectively. Experimental results on real world observational data capturing treatment recommendations for asthma patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "  Building a good generative model for image has long been an important topic in computer vision and machine learning. Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is one of such models that is simple but powerful. However, its restricted form also has placed heavy constraints on the models representation power and scalability. Many extensions have been invented based on RBM in order to produce deeper architectures with greater power. The most famous ones among them are deep belief network, which stacks multiple layer-wise pretrained RBMs to form a hybrid model, and deep Boltzmann machine, which allows connections between hidden units to form a multi-layer structure. In this paper, we present a new method to compose RBMs to form a multi-layer network style architecture and a training method that trains all layers jointly. We call the resulted structure deep restricted Boltzmann network. We further explore the combination of convolutional RBM with the normal fully connected RBM, which is made trivial under our composition framework. Experiments show that our model can generate descent images and outperform the normal RBM significantly in terms of image quality and feature quality, without losing much efficiency for training."}
{"text": "  Given a dataset, the task of learning a transform that allows sparse representations of the data bears the name of dictionary learning. In many applications, these learned dictionaries represent the data much better than the static well-known transforms (Fourier, Hadamard etc.). The main downside of learned transforms is that they lack structure and therefore they are not computationally efficient, unlike their classical counterparts. These posse several difficulties especially when using power limited hardware such as mobile devices, therefore discouraging the application of sparsity techniques in such scenarios. In this paper we construct orthogonal and non-orthogonal dictionaries that are factorized as a product of a few basic transformations. In the orthogonal case, we solve exactly the dictionary update problem for one basic transformation, which can be viewed as a generalized Givens rotation, and then propose to construct orthogonal dictionaries that are a product of these transformations, guaranteeing their fast manipulation. We also propose a method to construct fast square but non-orthogonal dictionaries that are factorized as a product of few transforms that can be viewed as a further generalization of Givens rotations to the non-orthogonal setting. We show how the proposed transforms can balance very well data representation performance and computational complexity. We also compare with classical fast and learned general and orthogonal transforms."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of troubleshooting machine learning systems that rely on analytical pipelines of distinct components. Understanding and fixing errors that arise in such integrative systems is difficult as failures can occur at multiple points in the execution workflow. Moreover, errors can propagate, become amplified or be suppressed, making blame assignment difficult. We propose a human-in-the-loop methodology which leverages human intellect for troubleshooting system failures. The approach simulates potential component fixes through human computation tasks and measures the expected improvements in the holistic behavior of the system. The method provides guidance to designers about how they can best improve the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on an automated image captioning system that has been pressed into real-world use."}

{"text": "  Sparse signal representations based on linear combinations of learned atoms have been used to obtain state-of-the-art results in several practical signal processing applications. Approximation methods are needed to process high-dimensional signals in this way because the problem to calculate optimal atoms for sparse coding is NP-hard. Here we study greedy algorithms for unsupervised learning of dictionaries of shift-invariant atoms and propose a new method where each atom is selected with the same probability on average, which corresponds to the homeostatic regulation of a recurrent convolutional neural network. Equiprobable selection can be used with several greedy algorithms for dictionary learning to ensure that all atoms adapt during training and that no particular atom is more likely to take part in the linear combination on average. We demonstrate via simulation experiments that dictionary learning with equiprobable selection results in higher entropy of the sparse representation and lower reconstruction and denoising errors, both in the case of ordinary matching pursuit and orthogonal matching pursuit with shift-invariant dictionaries. Furthermore, we show that the computational costs of the matching pursuits are lower with equiprobable selection, leading to faster and more accurate dictionary learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  Multi-domain learning aims to benefit from simultaneously learning across several different but related domains. In this chapter, we propose a single framework that unifies multi-domain learning (MDL) and the related but better studied area of multi-task learning (MTL). By exploiting the concept of a \\emph{semantic descriptor} we show how our framework encompasses various classic and recent MDL/MTL algorithms as special cases with different semantic descriptor encodings. As a second contribution, we present a higher order generalisation of this framework, capable of simultaneous multi-task-multi-domain learning. This generalisation has two mathematically equivalent views in multi-linear algebra and gated neural networks respectively. Moreover, by exploiting the semantic descriptor, it provides neural networks the capability of zero-shot learning (ZSL), where a classifier is generated for an unseen class without any training data; as well as zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA), where a model is generated for an unseen domain without any training data. In practice, this framework provides a powerful yet easy to implement method that can be flexibly applied to MTL, MDL, ZSL and ZSDA."}

In this paper, we define a probabilistic generalization of this approach. We model the observable real-valued signal as the real part of a latent complex-valued Gaussian process. In order to obtain the appropriate statistical relationship between its real and imaginary parts, we define two new classes of complex-valued covariance functions. Through an analysis of simulated chirplets and stochastic oscillations, we show that the resulting Gaussian process complex-valued signal provides a better estimate of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency than the established approaches. Furthermore, the complex-valued Gaussian process regression allows to incorporate prior information about the structure in signal and noise and thereby to tailor the analysis to the features of the signal. As a example, we analyze the non-stationary dynamics of brain oscillations in the alpha band, as measured using magneto-encephalography."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-dimensional tensor regression problems with low-rank structure. One of the core challenges associated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the underlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations could lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On the other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In this paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees for learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank structural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied to a potentially non-convex constraint set $\\Theta$ in terms of its \\emph{localized Gaussian width}. We juxtapose our theoretical results for non-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on regularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and non-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the non-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has desirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical upper bound perspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of examples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which address these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and convex approaches. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that, under several common settings of generalized low rank tensor regression, the projected gradient descent approach is superior both in terms of statistical error and run-time provided the step-sizes of the projected descent algorithm are suitably chosen."}
{"text": "  Variational inference provides a powerful tool for approximate probabilistic in- ference on complex, structured models. Typical variational inference methods, however, require to use inference networks with computationally tractable proba- bility density functions. This largely limits the design and implementation of vari- ational inference methods. We consider wild variational inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the inference networks, and hence can be applied in more challenging cases. As an example of application, we treat stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as an inference network, and use our methods to automatically adjust the step sizes of SGLD, yielding significant improvement over the hand-designed step size schemes"}
{"text": "  The problem of learning long-term dependencies in sequences using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is still a major challenge. Recent methods have been suggested to solve this problem by constraining the transition matrix to be unitary during training which ensures that its norm is equal to one and prevents exploding gradients. These methods either have limited expressiveness or scale poorly with the size of the network when compared with the simple RNN case, especially when using stochastic gradient descent with a small mini-batch size. Our contributions are as follows; we first show that constraining the transition matrix to be unitary is a special case of an orthogonal constraint. Then we present a new parametrisation of the transition matrix which allows efficient training of an RNN while ensuring that the matrix is always orthogonal. Our results show that the orthogonal constraint on the transition matrix applied through our parametrisation gives similar benefits to the unitary constraint, without the time complexity limitations."}
{"text": "  Feature selection is a process of choosing a subset of relevant features so that the quality of prediction models can be improved. An extensive body of work exists on information-theoretic feature selection, based on maximizing Mutual Information (MI) between subsets of features and class labels. The prior methods use a lower order approximation, by treating the joint entropy as a summation of several single variable entropies. This leads to locally optimal selections and misses multi-way feature combinations. We present a higher order MI based approximation technique called Higher Order Feature Selection (HOFS). Instead of producing a single list of features, our method produces a ranked collection of feature subsets that maximizes MI, giving better comprehension (feature ranking) as to which features work best together when selected, due to their underlying interdependent structure. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than existing feature selection approaches while keeping similar running times and computational complexity."}
{"text": "  We aim to create a framework for transfer learning using latent factor models to learn the dependence structure between a larger source dataset and a target dataset. The methodology is motivated by our goal of building a risk-assessment model for surgery patients, using both institutional and national surgical outcomes data. The national surgical outcomes data is collected through NSQIP (National Surgery Quality Improvement Program), a database housing almost 4 million patients from over 700 different hospitals. We build a latent factor model with a hierarchical prior on the loadings matrix to appropriately account for the different covariance structure in our data. We extend this model to handle more complex relationships between the populations by deriving a scale mixture formulation using stick-breaking properties. Our model provides a transfer learning framework that utilizes all information from both the source and target data, while modeling the underlying inherent differences between them."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel approach for parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationships, for which existing techniques exploiting graphical model structure are not applicable. Our approach is motivated by a model of seismic events and signals, where events detected in distant regions are approximately independent given those in intermediate regions. We perform parallel inference by coloring a factor graph defined over regions of latent space, rather than individual model variables. Evaluating on a model of seismic event detection, we achieve significant speedups over serial MCMC with no degradation in inference quality."}
{"text": "  With the introduction of the Electric Health Records, large amounts of digital data become available for analysis and decision support. When physicians are prescribing treatments to a patient, they need to consider a large range of data variety and volume, making decisions increasingly complex. Machine learning based Clinical Decision Support systems can be a solution to the data challenges. In this work we focus on a class of decision support in which the physicians' decision is directly predicted. Concretely, the model would assign higher probabilities to decisions that it presumes the physician are more likely to make. Thus the CDS system can provide physicians with rational recommendations. We also address the problem of correlation in target features: Often a physician is required to make multiple (sub-)decisions in a block, and that these decisions are mutually dependent. We propose a solution to the target correlation problem using a tensor factorization model. In order to handle the patients' historical information as sequential data, we apply the so-called Encoder-Decoder-Framework which is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as encoders and a tensor factorization model as a decoder, a combination which is novel in machine learning. With experiments with real-world datasets we show that the proposed model does achieve better prediction performances."}
{"text": "  Time Series Clustering is an important subroutine in many higher-level data mining analyses, including data editing for classifiers, summarization, and outlier detection. It is well known that for similarity search the superiority of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean distance gradually diminishes as we consider ever larger datasets. However, as we shall show, the same is not true for clustering. Clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally expensive operation. In this work, we address this issue in two ways. We propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both the upper and lower bounds to prune off a very large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This pruning strategy is admissible and gives us provably identical results to the brute force algorithm, but is at least an order of magnitude faster. For datasets where even this level of speedup is inadequate, we show that we can use a simple heuristic to order the unavoidable calculations in a most-useful-first ordering, thus casting the clustering into an anytime framework. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both single and multidimensional case studies in the domains of astronomy, speech physiology, medicine and entomology. In addition, we show the generality of our clustering framework to other domains by efficiently obtaining semantically significant clusters in protein sequences using the Edit Distance, the discrete data analogue of DTW."}
{"text": "  Multiple extensions of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been proposed recently to address the difficulty of storing information over long time periods. In this paper, we experiment with the capacity of Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) to deal with these long-term dependencies on well-balanced strings of parentheses. We show that not only does the NTM emulate a stack with its heads and learn an algorithm to recognize such words, but it is also capable of strongly generalizing to much longer sequences."}
{"text": "  Exploration has been a crucial part of reinforcement learning, yet several important questions concerning exploration efficiency are still not answered satisfactorily by existing analytical frameworks. These questions include exploration parameter setting, situation analysis, and hardness of MDPs, all of which are unavoidable for practitioners. To bridge the gap between the theory and practice, we propose a new analytical framework called the success probability of exploration. We show that those important questions of exploration above can all be answered under our framework, and the answers provided by our framework meet the needs of practitioners better than the existing ones. More importantly, we introduce a concrete and practical approach to evaluating the success probabilities in certain MDPs without the need of actually running the learning algorithm. We then provide empirical results to verify our approach, and demonstrate how the success probability of exploration can be used to analyse and predict the behaviours and possible outcomes of exploration, which are the keys to the answer of the important questions of exploration."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks are widely used in machine learning applications. However, the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32, 44, 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch, which means it's as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference, only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed, therefore our models are nearly 16x smaller than full-precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks, which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32,44,56 by 0.04%, 0.16%, 0.36%, respectively. On ImageNet, our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3%."}
{"text": "  Superoptimization requires the estimation of the best program for a given computational task. In order to deal with large programs, superoptimization techniques perform a stochastic search. This involves proposing a modification of the current program, which is accepted or rejected based on the improvement achieved. The state of the art method uses uniform proposal distributions, which fails to exploit the problem structure to the fullest. To alleviate this deficiency, we learn a proposal distribution over possible modifications using Reinforcement Learning. We provide convincing results on the superoptimization of \"Hacker's Delight\" programs."}
{"text": "  Portfolio management is the decision-making process of allocating an amount of fund into different financial investment products. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. This paper presents a model-less convolutional neural network with historic prices of a set of financial assets as its input, outputting portfolio weights of the set. The network is trained with 0.7 years' price data from a cryptocurrency exchange. The training is done in a reinforcement manner, maximizing the accumulative return, which is regarded as the reward function of the network. Backtest trading experiments with trading period of 30 minutes is conducted in the same market, achieving 10-fold returns in 1.8 months' periods. Some recently published portfolio selection strategies are also used to perform the same back-tests, whose results are compared with the neural network. The network is not limited to cryptocurrency, but can be applied to any other financial markets."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make diagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an intuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms. These drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data and make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world patient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels. Next, we extend a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model (IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen discomfort drawing. Experimental results show reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort drawing. The positive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be used for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support system for physicians and other health care personnel."}
{"text": "  We propose online algorithms for sequential learning in the contextual multi-armed bandit setting. Our approach is to partition the context space and then optimally combine all of the possible mappings between the partition regions and the set of bandit arms in a data driven manner. We show that in our approach, the best mapping is able to approximate the best arm selection policy to any desired degree under mild Lipschitz conditions. Therefore, we design our algorithms based on the optimal adaptive combination and asymptotically achieve the performance of the best mapping as well as the best arm selection policy. This optimality is also guaranteed to hold even in adversarial environments since we do not rely on any statistical assumptions regarding the contexts or the loss of the bandit arms. Moreover, we design efficient implementations for our algorithms in various hierarchical partitioning structures such as lexicographical or arbitrary position splitting and binary trees (and several other partitioning examples). For instance, in the case of binary tree partitioning, the computational complexity is only log-linear in the number of regions in the finest partition. In conclusion, we provide significant performance improvements by introducing upper bounds (w.r.t. the best arm selection policy) that are mathematically proven to vanish in the average loss per round sense at a faster rate compared to the state-of-the-art. Our experimental work extensively covers various scenarios ranging from bandit settings to multi-class classification with real and synthetic data. In these experiments, we show that our algorithms are highly superior over the state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining the introduced mathematical guarantees and a computationally decent scalability."}
{"text": "  We propose a new modeling approach that is a generalization of generative and discriminative models. The core idea is to use an implicit parameterization of a joint probability distribution by specifying only the conditional distributions. The proposed scheme combines the advantages of both worlds -- it can use powerful complex discriminative models as its parts, having at the same time better generalization capabilities. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed method for a simple classification task with artificial data and illustrate its advantages for real-word scenarios on a semantic image segmentation problem."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be quite effective in a vast array of machine learning tasks, with recent examples in cyber security and autonomous vehicles. Despite the superior performance of DNNs in these applications, it has been recently shown that these models are susceptible to a particular type of attack that exploits a fundamental flaw in their design. This attack consists of generating particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples. These samples are constructed by slightly manipulating real data-points in order to \"fool\" the original DNN model, forcing it to mis-classify previously correctly classified samples with high confidence. Addressing this flaw in the model is essential if DNNs are to be used in critical applications such as those in cyber security.   Previous work has provided various learning algorithms to enhance the robustness of DNN models, and they all fall into the tactic of \"security through obscurity\". This means security can be guaranteed only if one can obscure the learning algorithms from adversaries. Once the learning technique is disclosed, DNNs protected by these defense mechanisms are still susceptible to adversarial samples. In this work, we investigate this issue shared across previous research work and propose a generic approach to escalate a DNN's resistance to adversarial samples. More specifically, our approach integrates a data transformation module with a DNN, making it robust even if we reveal the underlying learning algorithm. To demonstrate the generality of our proposed approach and its potential for handling cyber security applications, we evaluate our method and several other existing solutions on datasets publicly available. Our results indicate that our approach typically provides superior classification performance and resistance in comparison with state-of-art solutions."}
{"text": "  Zeroth-order (derivative-free) optimization attracts a lot of attention in machine learning, because explicit gradient calculations may be computationally expensive or infeasible. To handle large scale problems both in volume and dimension, recently asynchronous doubly stochastic zeroth-order algorithms were proposed. The convergence rate of existing asynchronous doubly stochastic zeroth order algorithms is $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}})$ (also for the sequential stochastic zeroth-order optimization algorithms). In this paper, we focus on the finite sums of smooth but not necessarily convex functions, and propose an asynchronous doubly stochastic zeroth-order optimization algorithm using the accelerated technology of variance reduction (AsyDSZOVR). Rigorous theoretical analysis show that the convergence rate can be improved from $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}})$ the best result of existing algorithms to $O(\\frac{1}{T})$. Also our theoretical results is an improvement to the ones of the sequential stochastic zeroth-order optimization algorithms."}
{"text": "  Noise injection (NI) is an efficient technique to mitigate over-fitting in neural networks (NNs). The Bernoulli NI procedure as implemented in dropout and shakeout has connections with $l_1$ and $l_2$ regularization for the NN model parameters. We propose whiteout, a family NI regularization techniques (NIRT) through injecting adaptive Gaussian noises during the training of NNs. Whiteout is the first NIRT than imposes a broad range of the $l_{\\gamma}$ sparsity regularization $(\\gamma\\in(0,2))$ without having to involving the $l_2$ regularization. Whiteout can also be extended to offer regularizations similar to the adaptive lasso and group lasso. We establish the regularization effect of whiteout in the framework of generalized linear models with closed-form penalty terms and show that whiteout stabilizes the training of NNs with decreased sensitivity to small perturbations in the input. We establish that the noise-perturbed empirical loss function (pelf) with whiteout converges almost surely to the ideal loss function (ilf), and the minimizer of the pelf is consistent for the minimizer of the ilf. We derive the tail bound on the pelf to establish the practical feasibility in its minimization. The superiority of whiteout over the Bernoulli NIRTs, dropout and shakeout, in learning NNs with relatively small-sized training sets and non-inferiority in large-sized training sets is demonstrated in both simulated and real-life data sets. This work represents the first in-depth theoretical, methodological, and practical examination of the regularization effects of both additive and multiplicative Gaussian NI in deep NNs."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we address learning problems for high dimensional data. Previously, oblivious random projection based approaches that project high dimensional features onto a random subspace have been used in practice for tackling high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. Recently, various non-oblivious randomized reduction methods have been developed and deployed for solving many numerical problems such as matrix product approximation, low-rank matrix approximation, etc. However, they are less explored for the machine learning tasks, e.g., classification. More seriously, the theoretical analysis of excess risk bounds for risk minimization, an important measure of generalization performance, has not been established for non-oblivious randomized reduction methods. It therefore remains an open problem what is the benefit of using them over previous oblivious random projection based approaches. To tackle these challenges, we propose an algorithmic framework for employing non-oblivious randomized reduction method for general empirical risk minimizing in machine learning tasks, where the original high-dimensional features are projected onto a random subspace that is derived from the data with a small matrix approximation error. We then derive the first excess risk bound for the proposed non-oblivious randomized reduction approach without requiring strong assumptions on the training data. The established excess risk bound exhibits that the proposed approach provides much better generalization performance and it also sheds more insights about different randomized reduction approaches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, whose dimension scales to $O(10^7)$, to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Supervised topic models can help clinical researchers find interpretable cooccurence patterns in count data that are relevant for diagnostics. However, standard formulations of supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation have two problems. First, when documents have many more words than labels, the influence of the labels will be negligible. Second, due to conditional independence assumptions in the graphical model the impact of supervised labels on the learned topic-word probabilities is often minimal, leading to poor predictions on heldout data. We investigate penalized optimization methods for training sLDA that produce interpretable topic-word parameters and useful heldout predictions, using recognition networks to speed-up inference. We report preliminary results on synthetic data and on predicting successful anti-depressant medication given a patient's diagnostic history."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we consider the patient similarity matching problem over a cancer cohort of more than 220,000 patients. Our approach first leverages on Word2Vec framework to embed ICD codes into vector-valued representation. We then propose a sequential algorithm for case-control matching on this representation space of diagnosis codes. The novel practice of applying the sequential matching on the vector representation lifted the matching accuracy measured through multiple clinical outcomes. We reported the results on a large-scale dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For such a large dataset where most clinical information has been codified, the new method is particularly relevant."}
{"text": "  The combinatorial stochastic semi-bandit problem is an extension of the classical multi-armed bandit problem in which an algorithm pulls more than one arm at each stage and the rewards of all pulled arms are revealed. One difference with the single arm variant is that the dependency structure of the arms is crucial. Previous works on this setting either used a worst-case approach or imposed independence of the arms. We introduce a way to quantify the dependency structure of the problem and design an algorithm that adapts to it. The algorithm is based on linear regression and the analysis develops techniques from the linear bandit literature. By comparing its performance to a new lower bound, we prove that it is optimal, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the number of pulled arms."}
{"text": "  Bagging is a device intended for reducing the prediction error of learning algorithms. In its simplest form, bagging draws bootstrap samples from the training sample, applies the learning algorithm to each bootstrap sample, and then averages the resulting prediction rules.   We extend the definition of bagging from statistics to statistical functionals and study the von Mises expansion of bagged statistical functionals. We show that the expansion is related to the Efron-Stein ANOVA expansion of the raw (unbagged) functional. The basic observation is that a bagged functional is always smooth in the sense that the von Mises expansion exists and is finite of length 1 + resample size $M$. This holds even if the raw functional is rough or unstable. The resample size $M$ acts as a smoothing parameter, where a smaller $M$ means more smoothing."}
{"text": "  We develop a general problem setting for training and testing the ability of agents to gather information efficiently. Specifically, we present a collection of tasks in which success requires searching through a partially-observed environment, for fragments of information which can be pieced together to accomplish various goals. We combine deep architectures with techniques from reinforcement learning to develop agents that solve our tasks. We shape the behavior of these agents by combining extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. We empirically demonstrate that these agents learn to search actively and intelligently for new information to reduce their uncertainty, and to exploit information they have already acquired."}
{"text": "  We focus on the maximum regularization parameter for anisotropic total-variation denoising. It corresponds to the minimum value of the regularization parameter above which the solution remains constant. While this value is well know for the Lasso, such a critical value has not been investigated in details for the total-variation. Though, it is of importance when tuning the regularization parameter as it allows fixing an upper-bound on the grid for which the optimal parameter is sought. We establish a closed form expression for the one-dimensional case, as well as an upper-bound for the two-dimensional case, that appears reasonably tight in practice. This problem is directly linked to the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the divergence, which can be quickly obtained by performing convolutions in the Fourier domain."}
{"text": "  This paper presents an algorithm for the unsupervised learning of latent variable models from unlabeled sets of data. We base our technique on spectral decomposition, providing a technique that proves to be robust both in theory and in practice. We also describe how to use this algorithm to learn the parameters of two well known text mining models: single topic model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, providing in both cases an efficient technique to retrieve the parameters to feed the algorithm. We compare the results of our algorithm with those of existing algorithms on synthetic data, and we provide examples of applications to real world text corpora for both single topic model and LDA, obtaining meaningful results."}
{"text": "  This article will devise data-driven, mathematical laws that generate optimal, statistical classification systems which achieve minimum error rates for data distributions with unchanging statistics. Thereby, I will design learning machines that minimize the expected risk or probability of misclassification. I will devise a system of fundamental equations of binary classification for a classification system in statistical equilibrium. I will use this system of equations to formulate the problem of learning unknown, linear and quadratic discriminant functions from data as a locus problem, thereby formulating geometric locus methods within a statistical framework. Solving locus problems involves finding equations of curves or surfaces defined by given properties and finding graphs or loci of given equations. I will devise three systems of data-driven, locus equations that generate optimal, statistical classification systems. Each class of learning machines satisfies fundamental statistical laws for a classification system in statistical equilibrium. Thereby, I will formulate three classes of learning machines that are scalable modules for optimal, statistical pattern recognition systems, all of which are capable of performing a wide variety of statistical pattern recognition tasks, where any given M-class statistical pattern recognition system exhibits optimal generalization performance for an M-class feature space."}
{"text": "  The stochastic variational inference (SVI) paradigm, which combines variational inference, natural gradients, and stochastic updates, was recently proposed for large-scale data analysis in conjugate Bayesian models and demonstrated to be effective in several problems. This paper studies a family of Bayesian latent variable models with two levels of hidden variables but without any conjugacy requirements, making several contributions in this context. The first is observing that SVI, with an improved structured variational approximation, is applicable under more general conditions than previously thought with the only requirement being that the approximating variational distribution be in the same family as the prior. The resulting approach, Monte Carlo Structured SVI (MC-SSVI), significantly extends the scope of SVI, enabling large-scale learning in non-conjugate models. For models with latent Gaussian variables we propose a hybrid algorithm, using both standard and natural gradients, which is shown to improve stability and convergence. Applications in mixed effects models, sparse Gaussian processes, probabilistic matrix factorization and correlated topic models demonstrate the generality of the approach and the advantages of the proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "  The success of deep neural networks hinges on our ability to accurately and efficiently optimize high-dimensional, non-convex functions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the loss functions of state-of-the-art networks, and how commonly-used stochastic gradient descent variants optimize these loss functions. To do this, we visualize the loss function by projecting them down to low-dimensional spaces chosen based on the convergence points of different optimization algorithms. Our observations suggest that optimization algorithms encounter and choose different descent directions at many saddle points to find different final weights. Based on consistency we observe across re-runs of the same stochastic optimization algorithm, we hypothesize that each optimization algorithm makes characteristic choices at these saddle points."}
{"text": "  The vanishing and exploding gradient problems are well-studied obstacles that make it difficult for recurrent neural networks to learn long-term time dependencies. We propose a reparameterization of standard recurrent neural networks to update linear transformations in a provably norm-preserving way through Givens rotations. Additionally, we use the absolute value function as an element-wise non-linearity to preserve the norm of backpropagated signals over the entire network. We show that this reparameterization reduces the number of parameters and maintains the same algorithmic complexity as a standard recurrent neural network, while outperforming standard recurrent neural networks with orthogonal initializations and Long Short-Term Memory networks on the copy problem."}
{"text": "  We present an architecture which lets us train deep, directed generative models with many layers of latent variables. We include deterministic paths between all latent variables and the generated output, and provide a richer set of connections between computations for inference and generation, which enables more effective communication of information throughout the model during training. To improve performance on natural images, we incorporate a lightweight autoregressive model in the reconstruction distribution. These techniques permit end-to-end training of models with 10+ layers of latent variables. Experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard image modelling benchmarks, can expose latent class structure in the absence of label information, and can provide convincing imputations of occluded regions in natural images."}

{"text": "  Spectral analysis of neighborhood graphs is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data analysis, with applications ranging from machine learning to social sciences. In such applications, it is typical to first encode relationships between the data samples using an appropriate similarity function. Popular neighborhood construction techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are known to be very sensitive to the choice of parameters, and more importantly susceptible to noise and varying densities. In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of the local scales. In addition to being highly resilient to noise or outlying data, the proposed approach does not require extensive parameter tuning unlike several existing methods. Using applications in spectral clustering and single-example label propagation, we show that the proposed neighborhood graphs outperform existing locally scaled graph construction approaches."}
{"text": "  Many popular network models rely on the assumption of (vertex) exchangeability, in which the distribution of the graph is invariant to relabelings of the vertices. However, the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or empty with probability one, whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure."}
{"text": "  I aim to show that models, classification or generating functions, invariances and datasets are algorithmically equivalent concepts once properly defined, and provide some concrete examples of them. I then show that a) neural networks (NNs) of different kinds can be seen to implement models, b) that perturbations of inputs and nodes in NNs trained to optimally implement simple models propagate strongly, c) that there is a framework in which recurrent, deep and shallow networks can be seen to fall into a descriptive power hierarchy in agreement with notions from the theory of recursive functions. The motivation for these definitions and following analysis lies in the context of cognitive neuroscience, and in particular in Ruffini (2016), where the concept of model is used extensively, as is the concept of algorithmic complexity."}
{"text": "  This paper frames causal structure estimation as a machine learning task. The idea is to treat indicators of causal relationships between variables as `labels' and to exploit available data on the variables of interest to provide features for the labelling task. Background scientific knowledge or any available interventional data provide labels on some causal relationships and the remainder are treated as unlabelled. To illustrate the key ideas, we develop a distance-based approach (based on bivariate histograms) within a manifold regularization framework. We present empirical results on three different biological data sets (including examples where causal effects can be verified by experimental intervention), that together demonstrate the efficacy and general nature of the approach as well as its simplicity from a user's point of view."}

{"text": "  Tuning parameter selection is of critical importance for kernel ridge regression. To this date, data driven tuning method for divide-and-conquer kernel ridge regression (d-KRR) has been lacking in the literature, which limits the applicability of d-KRR for large data sets. In this paper, by modifying the Generalized Cross-validation (GCV, Wahba, 1990) score, we propose a distributed Generalized Cross-Validation (dGCV) as a data-driven tool for selecting the tuning parameters in d-KRR. Not only the proposed dGCV is computationally scalable for massive data sets, it is also shown, under mild conditions, to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that minimizing the dGCV score is equivalent to minimizing the true global conditional empirical loss of the averaged function estimator, extending the existing optimality results of GCV to the divide-and-conquer framework."}

Specifically, we quantize the weights to zero or powers of two by minimizing the Euclidean distance between full-precision weights and quantized weights during backpropagation. We characterize the combinatorial nature of the low bit-width quantization problem. For 2-bit (ternary) CNNs, the quantization of $N$ weights can be done by an exact formula in $O(N\\log N)$ complexity. When the bit-width is three and above, we further propose a semi-analytical thresholding scheme with a single free parameter for quantization that is computationally inexpensive. The free parameter is further determined by network retraining and object detection tests. LBW-Net has several desirable advantages over full-precision CNNs, including considerable memory savings, energy efficiency, and faster deployment. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC dataset show that compared with its 32-bit floating-point counterpart, the performance of the 6-bit LBW-Net is nearly lossless in the object detection tasks, and can even do better in some real world visual scenes, while empirically enjoying more than 4$\\times$ faster deployment."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel multivariate random process producing Bernoulli outputs per dimension, that can possibly formalize binary interactions in various graphical structures and can be used to model opinion dynamics, epidemics, financial and biological time series data, etc. We call this a Bernoulli Autoregressive Process (BAR). A BAR process models a discrete-time vector random sequence of $p$ scalar Bernoulli processes with autoregressive dynamics and corresponds to a particular Markov Chain. The benefit from the autoregressive dynamics is the description of a $2^p\\times 2^p$ transition matrix by at most $pd$ effective parameters for some $d\\ll p$ or by two sparse matrices of dimensions $p\\times p^2$ and $p\\times p$, respectively, parameterizing the transitions. Additionally, we show that the BAR process mixes rapidly, by proving that the mixing time is $O(\\log p)$. The hidden constant in the previous mixing time bound depends explicitly on the values of the chain parameters and implicitly on the maximum allowed in-degree of a node in the corresponding graph. For a network with $p$ nodes, where each node has in-degree at most $d$ and corresponds to a scalar Bernoulli process generated by a BAR, we provide a greedy algorithm that can efficiently learn the structure of the underlying directed graph with a sample complexity proportional to the mixing time of the BAR process. The sample complexity of the proposed algorithm is nearly order-optimal as it is only a $\\log p$ factor away from an information-theoretic lower bound. We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our algorithm in various setups, including a model for a biological signaling network."}
{"text": "  In this work we design and compare different supervised learning algorithms to compute the cost of Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). The motivation for quick calculation of OPF cost outcomes stems from the growing need of algorithmic-based long-term and medium-term planning methodologies in power networks. Integrated in a multiple time-horizon coordination framework, we refer to this approximation module as a proxy for predicting short-term decision outcomes without the need of actual simulation and optimization of them. Our method enables fast approximate calculation of OPF cost with less than 1% error on average, achieved in run-times that are several orders of magnitude lower than of exact computation. Several test-cases such as IEEE-RTS96 are used to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach."}
{"text": "  This paper formulates the problem of learning discriminative features (\\textit{i.e.,} segments) from networked time series data considering the linked information among time series. For example, social network users are considered to be social sensors that continuously generate social signals (tweets) represented as a time series. The discriminative segments are often referred to as \\emph{shapelets} in a time series. Extracting shapelets for time series classification has been widely studied. However, existing works on shapelet selection assume that the time series are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption restricts their applications to social networked time series analysis, since a user's actions can be correlated to his/her social affiliations. In this paper we propose a new Network Regularized Least Squares (NetRLS) feature selection model that combines typical time series data and user network data for analysis. Experiments on real-world networked time series Twitter and DBLP data demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. NetRLS performs better than LTS, the state-of-the-art time series feature selection approach, on real-world data."}
{"text": "  A graph-based classification method is proposed for semi-supervised learning in the case of Euclidean data and for classification in the case of graph data. Our manifold learning technique is based on a convex optimization problem involving a convex quadratic regularization term and a concave quadratic loss function with a trade-off parameter carefully chosen so that the objective function remains convex. As shown empirically, the advantage of considering a concave loss function is that the learning problem becomes more robust in the presence of noisy labels. Furthermore, the loss function considered here is then more similar to a classification loss while several other methods treat graph-based classification problems as regression problems."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks have shown promise in collaborative filtering (CF). However, existing neural approaches are either user-based or item-based, which cannot leverage all the underlying information explicitly. We propose CF-UIcA, a neural co-autoregressive model for CF tasks, which exploits the structural correlation in the domains of both users and items. The co-autoregression allows extra desired properties to be incorporated for different tasks. Furthermore, we develop an efficient stochastic learning algorithm to handle large scale datasets. We evaluate CF-UIcA on two popular benchmarks: MovieLens 1M and Netflix, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CF-UIcA."}
{"text": "  Reinforcement learning optimizes policies for expected cumulative reward. Need the supervision be so narrow? Reward is delayed and sparse for many tasks, making it a difficult and impoverished signal for end-to-end optimization. To augment reward, we consider a range of self-supervised tasks that incorporate states, actions, and successors to provide auxiliary losses. These losses offer ubiquitous and instantaneous supervision for representation learning even in the absence of reward. While current results show that learning from reward alone is feasible, pure reinforcement learning methods are constrained by computational and data efficiency issues that can be remedied by auxiliary losses. Self-supervised pre-training and joint optimization improve the data efficiency and policy returns of end-to-end reinforcement learning."}
{"text": "  In this paper we obtain several informative error bounds on function approximation for the policy evaluation algorithm proposed by Basu et al. when the aim is to find the risk-sensitive cost represented using exponential utility. The main idea is to use classical Bapat's inequality and to use Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors (exists if we assume irreducible Markov chain) to get the new bounds. The novelty of our approach is that we use the irreduciblity of Markov chain to get the new bounds whereas the earlier work by Basu et al. used spectral variation bound which is true for any matrix. We also give examples where all our bounds achieve the \"actual error\" whereas the earlier bound given by Basu et al. is much weaker in comparison. We show that this happens due to the absence of difference term in the earlier bound which is always present in all our bounds when the state space is large. Additionally, we discuss how all our bounds compare with each other. As a corollary of our main result we provide a bound between largest eigenvalues of two irreducibile matrices in terms of the matrix entries."}
{"text": "  Gene expression data is widely used in disease analysis and cancer diagnosis. However, since gene expression data could contain thousands of genes simultaneously, successful microarray classification is rather difficult. Feature selection is an important pre-treatment for any classification process. Selecting a useful gene subset as a classifier not only decreases the computational time and cost, but also increases classification accuracy. In this study, we applied the information gain method as a filter approach, and an improved binary particle swarm optimization as a wrapper approach to implement feature selection; selected gene subsets were used to evaluate the performance of classification. Experimental results show that by employing the proposed method fewer gene subsets needed to be selected and better classification accuracy could be obtained."}
{"text": "  Composition and parameterization of multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) consisting of chains of data transformation steps are a challenging task. Auto-WEKA is a tool to automate the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) optimization problem. In this paper, we extend the CASH problem and Auto-WEKA to support the MCPS, including preprocessing steps for both classification and regression tasks. We define the optimization problem in which the search space consists of suitably parameterized Petri nets forming the sought MCPS solutions. In the experimental analysis, we focus on examining the impact of considerably extending the search space (from approximately 22,000 to 812 billion possible combinations of methods and categorical hyperparameters). In a range of extensive experiments, three different optimization strategies are used to automatically compose MCPSs for 21 publicly available data sets. The diversity of the composed MCPSs found is an indication that fully and automatically exploiting different combinations of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques is possible and highly beneficial for different predictive models. We also present the results on seven data sets from real chemical production processes. Our findings can have a major impact on the development of high-quality predictive models as well as their maintenance and scalability aspects needed in modern applications and deployment scenarios."}
{"text": "  In typical applications of Bayesian optimization, minimal assumptions are made about the objective function being optimized. This is true even when researchers have prior information about the shape of the function with respect to one or more argument. We make the case that shape constraints are often appropriate in at least two important application areas of Bayesian optimization: (1) hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms and (2) decision analysis with utility functions. We describe a methodology for incorporating a variety of shape constraints within the usual Bayesian optimization framework and present positive results from simple applications which suggest that Bayesian optimization with shape constraints is a promising topic for further research."}

We also provide limit theorems to characterize the behavior of our proposed functions of bandwidth."}
{"text": "  It is argued that deep learning is efficient for data that is generated from hierarchal generative models. Examples of such generative models include wavelet scattering networks, functions of compositional structure, and deep rendering models. Unfortunately so far, for all such models, it is either not rigorously known that they can be learned efficiently, or it is not known that \"deep algorithms\" are required in order to learn them.   We propose a simple family of \"generative hierarchal models\" which can be efficiently learned and where \"deep\" algorithm are necessary for learning. Our definition of \"deep\" algorithms is based on the empirical observation that deep nets necessarily use correlations between features. More formally, we show that in a semi-supervised setting, given access to low-order moments of the labeled data and all of the unlabeled data, it is information theoretically impossible to perform classification while at the same time there is an efficient algorithm, that given all labelled and unlabeled data, perfectly labels all unlabelled data with high probability.   For the proof, we use and strengthen the fact that Belief Propagation does not admit a good approximation in terms of linear functions."}

{"text": "  We propose communication-efficient distributed estimation and inference methods for the transelliptical graphical model, a semiparametric extension of the elliptical distribution in the high dimensional regime. In detail, the proposed method distributes the $d$-dimensional data of size $N$ generated from a transelliptical graphical model into $m$ worker machines, and estimates the latent precision matrix on each worker machine based on the data of size $n=N/m$. It then debiases the local estimators on the worker machines and send them back to the master machine. Finally, on the master machine, it aggregates the debiased local estimators by averaging and hard thresholding. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimator based on all the data, provided that the number of machines satisfies $m \\lesssim \\min\\{N\\log d/d,\\sqrt{N/(s^2\\log d)}\\}$, where $s$ is the maximum number of nonzero entries in each column of the latent precision matrix. It is worth noting that our algorithm and theory can be directly applied to Gaussian graphical models, Gaussian copula graphical models and elliptical graphical models, since they are all special cases of transelliptical graphical models. Thorough experiments on synthetic data back up our theory."}
{"text": "  The recent successful deep neural networks are largely trained in a supervised manner. It {\\it associates} complex patterns of input samples with neurons in the last layer, which form representations of {\\it concepts}. In spite of their successes, the properties of complex patterns associated a learned concept remain elusive. In this work, by analyzing how neurons are associated with concepts in supervised networks, we hypothesize that with proper priors to regulate learning, neural networks can automatically associate neurons in the intermediate layers with concepts that are aligned with real world concepts, when trained only with labels that associate concepts with top level neurons, which is a plausible way for unsupervised learning. We develop a prior to verify the hypothesis and experimentally find the proposed prior help neural networks automatically learn both basic physical concepts at the lower layers, e.g., rotation of filters, and highly semantic concepts at the higher layers, e.g., fine-grained categories of an entry-level category."}
{"text": "  Joint blind source separation (J-BSS) is an emerging data-driven technique for multi-set data-fusion. In this paper, J-BSS is addressed from a tensorial perspective. We show how, by using second-order multi-set statistics in J-BSS, a specific double coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (DC-CPD) problem can be formulated. We propose an algebraic DC-CPD algorithm based on a coupled rank-1 detection mapping. This algorithm converts a possibly underdetermined DC-CPD to a set of overdetermined CPDs. The latter can be solved algebraically via a generalized eigenvalue decomposition based scheme. Therefore, this algorithm is deterministic and returns the exact solution in the noiseless case. In the noisy case, it can be used to effectively initialize optimization based DC-CPD algorithms. In addition, we obtain the determini- stic and generic uniqueness conditions for DC-CPD, which are shown to be more relaxed than their CPD counterpart. Experiment results are given to illustrate the superiority of DC-CPD over standard CPD based BSS methods and several existing J-BSS methods, with regards to uniqueness and accuracy."}
{"text": "  Finding the main product of a chemical reaction is one of the important problems of organic chemistry. This paper describes a method of applying a neural machine translation model to the prediction of organic chemical reactions. In order to translate 'reactants and reagents' to 'products', a gated recurrent unit based sequence-to-sequence model and a parser to generate input tokens for model from reaction SMILES strings were built. Training sets are composed of reactions from the patent databases, and reactions manually generated applying the elementary reactions in an organic chemistry textbook of Wade. The trained models were tested by examples and problems in the textbook. The prediction process does not need manual encoding of rules (e.g., SMARTS transformations) to predict products, hence it only needs sufficient training reaction sets to learn new types of reactions."}

{"text": "  Personalized treatment of patients based on tissue-specific cancer subtypes has strongly increased the efficacy of the chosen therapies. Even though the amount of data measured for cancer patients has increased over the last years, most cancer subtypes are still diagnosed based on individual data sources (e.g. gene expression data). We propose an unsupervised data integration method based on kernel principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in data analysis. Unfortunately, the straight-forward multiple-kernel extension of this method leads to the use of only one of the input matrices, which does not fit the goal of gaining information from all data sources. Therefore, we present a scoring function to determine the impact of each input matrix. The approach enables visualizing the integrated data and subsequent clustering for cancer subtype identification. Due to the nature of the method, no free parameters have to be set. We apply the methodology to five different cancer data sets and demonstrate its advantages in terms of results and usability."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of estimating low-rank matrices from linear measurements (a.k.a., matrix sensing) through nonconvex optimization. We propose an efficient stochastic variance reduced gradient descent algorithm to solve a nonconvex optimization problem of matrix sensing. Our algorithm is applicable to both noisy and noiseless settings. In the case with noisy observations, we prove that our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate up to the minimax optimal statistical error. And in the noiseless setting, our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix and achieves exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. Most notably, the overall computational complexity of our proposed algorithm, which is defined as the iteration complexity times per iteration time complexity, is lower than the state-of-the-art algorithms based on gradient descent. Experiments on synthetic data corroborate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms."}
{"text": "  Discovering causal models from observational and interventional data is an important first step preceding what-if analysis or counterfactual reasoning. As has been shown before, the direction of pairwise causal relations can, under certain conditions, be inferred from observational data via standard gradient-boosted classifiers (GBC) using carefully engineered statistical features. In this paper we apply deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to this problem by plotting attribute pairs as 2-D scatter plots that are fed to the CNN as images. We evaluate our approach on the 'Cause- Effect Pairs' NIPS 2013 Data Challenge. We observe that a weighted ensemble of CNN with the earlier GBC approach yields significant improvement. Further, we observe that when less training data is available, our approach performs better than the GBC based approach suggesting that CNN models pre-trained to determine the direction of pairwise causal direction could have wider applicability in causal discovery and enabling what-if or counterfactual analysis."}

At the Bosch assembly line, data is recorded for products as they progress through each stage. Data science methods are applied to this huge data repository consisting records of tests and measurements made for each component along the assembly line to predict internal failures. We found that it is possible to train a model that predicts which parts are most likely to fail. Thus a smarter failure detection system can be built and the parts tagged likely to fail can be salvaged to decrease operating costs and increase the profit margins."}
{"text": "  We analyze a new approach to Machine Learning coming from a modification of classical regularization networks by casting the process in the time dimension, leading to a sort of collapse of dimensionality in the problem of learning the model parameters. This approach allows the definition of a online learning algorithm that progressively accumulates the knowledge provided in the input trajectory. The regularization principle leads to a solution based on a dynamical system that is paired with a procedure to develop a graph structure that stores the input regularities acquired from the temporal evolution. We report an extensive experimental exploration on the behavior of the parameter of the proposed model and an evaluation on artificial dataset."}
{"text": "  This paper considers the problem of simultaneously learning the Sensing Matrix and Sparsifying Dictionary (SMSD) on a large training dataset. To address the formulated joint learning problem, we propose an online algorithm that consists of a closed-form solution for optimizing the sensing matrix with a fixed sparsifying dictionary and a stochastic method for learning the sparsifying dictionary on a large dataset when the sensing matrix is given. Benefiting from training on a large dataset, the obtained compressive sensing (CS) system by the proposed algorithm yields a much better performance in terms of signal recovery accuracy than the existing ones. The simulation results on natural images demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested online algorithm compared with the existing methods."}
{"text": "  Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of non-linear systems from experimental datasets. Recently, several attempts have extended DMD to the context of low-rank approximations. This extension is of particular interest for reduced-order modeling in various applicative domains, e.g. for climate prediction, to study molecular dynamics or micro-electromechanical devices. This low-rank extension takes the form of a non-convex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, only sub-optimal algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute the solution of this problem. In this paper, we prove that there exists a closed-form optimal solution to this problem and design an effective algorithm to compute it based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A toy-example illustrates the gain in performance of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art techniques."}
{"text": "  Classification, which involves finding rules that partition a given data set into disjoint groups, is one class of data mining problems. Approaches proposed so far for mining classification rules for large databases are mainly decision tree based symbolic learning methods. The connectionist approach based on neural networks has been thought not well suited for data mining. One of the major reasons cited is that knowledge generated by neural networks is not explicitly represented in the form of rules suitable for verification or interpretation by humans. This paper examines this issue. With our newly developed algorithms, rules which are similar to, or more concise than those generated by the symbolic methods can be extracted from the neural networks. The data mining process using neural networks with the emphasis on rule extraction is described. Experimental results and comparison with previously published works are presented."}
{"text": "  This workshop explores the interface between cognitive neuroscience and recent advances in AI fields that aim to reproduce human performance such as natural language processing and computer vision, and specifically deep learning approaches to such problems.   When studying the cognitive capabilities of the brain, scientists follow a system identification approach in which they present different stimuli to the subjects and try to model the response that different brain areas have of that stimulus. The goal is to understand the brain by trying to find the function that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of the stimulus. Experimental stimuli are becoming increasingly complex with more and more people being interested in studying real life phenomena such as the perception of natural images or natural sentences. There is therefore a need for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the stimulus, that we can obtain using advances in machine learning.   In parallel, new ML approaches, many of which in deep learning, are inspired to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently, processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings about brain function, and it is unclear whether it is at all beneficial for machine learning to try to emulate brain function in order to achieve the same tasks that the brain achieves."}
{"text": "  Recent years have seen an increasing popularity of learning the sparse \\emph{changes} in Markov Networks. Changes in the structure of Markov Networks reflect alternations of interactions between random variables under different regimes and provide insights into the underlying system. While each individual network structure can be complicated and difficult to learn, the overall change from one network to another can be simple. This intuition gave birth to an approach that \\emph{directly} learns the sparse changes without modelling and learning the individual (possibly dense) networks. In this paper, we review such a direct learning method with some latest developments along this line of research."}
{"text": "  In many real-world application, e.g., speech recognition or sleep stage classification, data are captured over the course of time, constituting a Time-Series. Time-Series often contain temporal dependencies that cause two otherwise identical points of time to belong to different classes or predict different behavior. This characteristic generally increases the difficulty of analysing them. Existing techniques often depended on hand-crafted features that were expensive to create and required expert knowledge of the field. With the advent of Deep Learning new models of unsupervised learning of features for Time-series analysis and forecast have been developed. Such new developments are the topic of this paper: a review of the main Deep Learning techniques is presented, and some applications on Time-Series analysis are summaried. The results make it clear that Deep Learning has a lot to contribute to the field."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new method for finding network motifs: interesting or informative subgraph patterns in a network. Subgraphs are motifs when their frequency in the data is high compared to the expected frequency under a null model. To compute this expectation, a full or approximate count of the occurrences of a motif is normally repeated on as many as 1000 random graphs sampled from the null model; a prohibitively expensive step. We use ideas from the Minimum Description Length (MDL) literature to define a new measure of motif relevance. With our method, samples from the null model are not required. Instead we compute the probability of the data under the null model and compare this to the probability under a specially designed alternative model. With this new relevance test, we can search for motifs by random sampling, rather than requiring an accurate count of all instances of a motif. This allows motif analysis to scale to networks with billions of links."}
{"text": "  Gaussian graphical model is a graphical representation of the dependence structure for a Gaussian random vector. It is recognized as a powerful tool in different applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech language, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection is a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample of a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection are suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family of individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach leads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical procedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic of these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing literature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect edge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also important to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type II error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection problem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of statistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses. Additive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We construct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine them to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure. We show that the obtained procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the linear combination of expected numbers of Type I and Type II errors in the class of unbiased multiple decision procedures."}
{"text": "  We propose a generic framework based on a new stochastic variance-reduced gradient descent algorithm for accelerating nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery. Starting from an appropriate initial estimator, our proposed algorithm performs projected gradient descent based on a novel semi-stochastic gradient specifically designed for low-rank matrix recovery. Based upon the mild restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions, we derive a projected notion of the restricted Lipschitz continuous gradient property, and prove that our algorithm enjoys linear convergence rate to the unknown low-rank matrix with an improved computational complexity. Moreover, our algorithm can be employed to both noiseless and noisy observations, where the optimal sample complexity and the minimax optimal statistical rate can be attained respectively. We further illustrate the superiority of our generic framework through several specific examples, both theoretically and experimentally."}

Secondly, we provide a consistency result which relates the empirical Christoffel function and its population counterpart in the limit of large samples.

{"text": "  In this article, a large dimensional performance analysis of kernel least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is provided under the assumption of a two-class Gaussian mixture model for the input data. Building upon recent advances in random matrix theory, we show, when the dimension of data $p$ and their number $n$ are both large, that the LS-SVM decision function can be well approximated by a normally distributed random variable, the mean and variance of which depend explicitly on a local behavior of the kernel function. This theoretical result is then applied to the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets which, despite their non-Gaussianity, exhibit a convincingly close behavior. Most importantly, our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism into play in SVM-type methods and in particular of the impact on the choice of the kernel function as well as some of their theoretical limits in separating high dimensional Gaussian vectors."}
{"text": "  The goal of predictive maintenance is to forecast the occurrence of faults of an appliance, in order to proactively take the necessary actions to ensure its availability. In many application scenarios, predictive maintenance is applied to a set of homogeneous appliances. In this paper, we firstly review taxonomies and main methodologies currently used for condition-based maintenance; secondly, we argue that the mutual dissimilarities of the behaviours of all appliances of this set (the \"cohort\") can be exploited to detect upcoming faults. Specifically, inspired by dissimilarity-based representations, we propose a novel machine learning approach based on the analysis of concurrent mutual differences of the measurements coming from the cohort. We evaluate our method over one year of historical data from a cohort of 17 HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems installed in an Italian hospital. We show that certain kinds of faults can be foreseen with an accuracy, measured in terms of area under the ROC curve, as high as 0.96."}
{"text": "  Recently, several algorithms for symbolic regression (SR) emerged which employ a form of multiple linear regression (LR) to produce generalized linear models. The use of LR allows the algorithms to create models with relatively small error right from the beginning of the search; such algorithms are thus claimed to be (sometimes by orders of magnitude) faster than SR algorithms based on vanilla genetic programming. However, a systematic comparison of these algorithms on a common set of problems is still missing. In this paper we conceptually and experimentally compare several representatives of such algorithms (GPTIPS, FFX, and EFS). They are applied as off-the-shelf, ready-to-use techniques, mostly using their default settings. The methods are compared on several synthetic and real-world SR benchmark problems. Their performance is also related to the performance of three conventional machine learning algorithms --- multiple regression, random forests and support vector regression."}
{"text": "  Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their variants are usually trained by contrastive divergence (CD) learning, but the training procedure is an unsupervised learning approach, without any guidances of the background knowledge. To enhance the expression ability of traditional RBMs, in this paper, we propose pairwise constraints restricted Boltzmann machine with Gaussian visible units (pcGRBM) model, in which the learning procedure is guided by pairwise constraints and the process of encoding is conducted under these guidances. The pairwise constraints are encoded in hidden layer features of pcGRBM. Then, some pairwise hidden features of pcGRBM flock together and another part of them are separated by the guidances. In order to deal with real-valued data, the binary visible units are replaced by linear units with Gausian noise in the pcGRBM model. In the learning process of pcGRBM, the pairwise constraints are iterated transitions between visible and hidden units during CD learning procedure. Then, the proposed model is inferred by approximative gradient descent method and the corresponding learning algorithm is designed in this paper. In order to compare the availability of pcGRBM and traditional RBMs with Gaussian visible units, the features of the pcGRBM and RBMs hidden layer are used as input 'data' for K-means, spectral clustering (SP) and affinity propagation (AP) algorithms, respectively. A thorough experimental evaluation is performed with sixteen image datasets of Microsoft Research Asia Multimedia (MSRA-MM). The experimental results show that the clustering performance of K-means, SP and AP algorithms based on pcGRBM model are significantly better than traditional RBMs. In addition, the pcGRBM model for clustering task shows better performance than some semi-supervised clustering algorithms."}
{"text": "  More and more processes governing our lives use in some part an automatic decision step, where -- based on a feature vector derived from an applicant -- an algorithm has the decision power over the final outcome. Here we present a simple idea which gives some of the power back to the applicant by providing her with alternatives which would make the decision algorithm decide differently. It is based on a formalization reminiscent of methods used for evasion attacks, and consists in enumerating the subspaces where the classifiers decides the desired output. This has been implemented for the specific case of decision forests (ensemble methods based on decision trees), mapping the problem to an iterative version of enumerating $k$-cliques."}

Field-aware Factorization Machines (FFM) have recently been established as a state-of-the-art method for that problem and in particular won two Kaggle challenges. This paper presents some results from implementing this method in a production system that predicts click-through and conversion rates for display advertising and shows that this method it is not only effective to win challenges but is also valuable in a real-world prediction system. We also discuss some specific challenges and solutions to reduce the training time, namely the use of an innovative seeding algorithm and a distributed learning mechanism."}
{"text": "  Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a multivariate statistical technique for finding the linear relationship between two sets of variables. The kernel generalization of CCA named kernel CCA has been proposed to find nonlinear relations between datasets. Despite their wide usage, they have one common limitation that is the lack of sparsity in their solution. In this paper, we consider sparse kernel CCA and propose a novel sparse kernel CCA algorithm (SKCCA). Our algorithm is based on a relationship between kernel CCA and least squares. Sparsity of the dual transformations is introduced by penalizing the $\\ell_{1}$-norm of dual vectors. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm not only performs well in computing sparse dual transformations but also can alleviate the over-fitting problem of kernel CCA."}
{"text": "  We derive bounds on the sample complexity of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in the context of minimizing non-convex risks that admit the strict saddle property. Recent progress in non-convex optimization has yielded efficient algorithms for minimizing such functions. Our results imply that these efficient algorithms are statistically stable and also generalize well. In particular, we derive fast rates which resemble the bounds that are often attained in the strongly convex setting. We specify our bounds to Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis. Our results and techniques may pave the way for statistical analyses of additional strict saddle problems."}
{"text": "  Regression models are increasingly built using datasets which do not follow a design of experiment. Instead, the data is e.g. gathered by an automated monitoring of a technical system. As a consequence, already the input data represents phenomena of the system and violates statistical assumptions of distributions. The input data can show correlations, clusters or other patterns. Further, the distribution of input data influences the reliability of regression models. We propose criteria to quantify typical phenomena of input data for regression and show their suitability with simulated benchmark datasets.   -----   Regressionen werden zunehmend auf Datens\\\"atzen angewendet, deren Eingangsvektoren nicht durch eine statistische Versuchsplanung festgelegt wurden.

{"text": "  This paper presents an online learning with regularized kernel based one-class extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier and is referred as online RK-OC-ELM. The baseline kernel hyperplane model considers whole data in a single chunk with regularized ELM approach for offline learning in case of one-class classification (OCC). Further, the basic hyper plane model is adapted in an online fashion from stream of training samples in this paper. Two frameworks viz., boundary and reconstruction are presented to detect the target class in online RKOC-ELM. Boundary framework based one-class classifier consists of single node output architecture and classifier endeavors to approximate all data to any real number. However, one-class classifier based on reconstruction framework is an autoencoder architecture, where output nodes are identical to input nodes and classifier endeavor to reconstruct input layer at the output layer. Both these frameworks employ regularized kernel ELM based online learning and consistency based model selection has been employed to select learning algorithm parameters. The performance of online RK-OC-ELM has been evaluated on standard benchmark datasets as well as on artificial datasets and the results are compared with existing state-of-the art one-class classifiers. The results indicate that the online learning one-class classifier is slightly better or same as batch learning based approaches. As, base classifier used for the proposed classifiers are based on the ELM, hence, proposed classifiers would also inherit the benefit of the base classifier i.e. it will perform faster computation compared to traditional autoencoder based one-class classifier."}
{"text": "  Gaussian processes (GPs) have been proven to be powerful tools in various areas of machine learning. However, there are very few applications of GPs in the scenario of multi-view learning. In this paper, we present a new GP model for multi-view learning. Unlike existing methods, it combines multiple views by regularizing marginal likelihood with the consistency among the posterior distributions of latent functions from different views. Moreover, we give a general point selection scheme for multi-view learning and improve the proposed model by this criterion. Experimental results on multiple real world data sets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model and witnessed the performance improvement through employing this novel point selection scheme."}
{"text": "  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are expressive latent variable models that can be used to learn complex probability distributions from training data. However, the quality of the resulting model crucially relies on the expressiveness of the inference model. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB), a technique for training Variational Autoencoders with arbitrarily expressive inference models. We achieve this by introducing an auxiliary discriminative network that allows to rephrase the maximum-likelihood-problem as a two-player game, hence establishing a principled connection between VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We show that in the nonparametric limit our method yields an exact maximum-likelihood assignment for the parameters of the generative model, as well as the exact posterior distribution over the latent variables given an observation. Contrary to competing approaches which combine VAEs with GANs, our approach has a clear theoretical justification, retains most advantages of standard Variational Autoencoders and is easy to implement."}
{"text": "  We introduce highly efficient online nonlinear regression algorithms that are suitable for real life applications. We process the data in a truly online manner such that no storage is needed, i.e., the data is discarded after being used. For nonlinear modeling we use a hierarchical piecewise linear approach based on the notion of decision trees where the space of the regressor vectors is adaptively partitioned based on the performance. As the first time in the literature, we learn both the piecewise linear partitioning of the regressor space as well as the linear models in each region using highly effective second order methods, i.e., Newton-Raphson Methods. Hence, we avoid the well known over fitting issues by using piecewise linear models, however, since both the region boundaries as well as the linear models in each region are trained using the second order methods, we achieve substantial performance compared to the state of the art. We demonstrate our gains over the well known benchmark data sets and provide performance results in an individual sequence manner guaranteed to hold without any statistical assumptions. Hence, the introduced algorithms address computational complexity issues widely encountered in real life applications while providing superior guaranteed performance in a strong deterministic sense."}
{"text": "  Random forest (RF) missing data algorithms are an attractive approach for dealing with missing data. They have the desirable properties of being able to handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings. Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms but relatively little guidance about their efficacy, which motivated us to study their performance. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting---the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Performance of algorithms was assessed by ability to impute data accurately. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing not at random."}
{"text": "  Estimation of individual treatment effect in observational data is complicated due to the challenges of confounding and selection bias. A useful inferential framework to address this is the counterfactual (potential outcomes) model which takes the hypothetical stance of asking what if an individual had received both treatments. Making use of random forests (RF) within the counterfactual framework we estimate individual treatment effects by directly modeling the response. We find accurate estimation of individual treatment effects is possible even in complex heterogeneous settings but that the type of RF approach plays an important role in accuracy. Methods designed to be adaptive to confounding, when used in parallel with out-of-sample estimation, do best. One method found to be especially promising is counterfactual synthetic forests. We illustrate this new methodology by applying it to a large comparative effectiveness trial, Project Aware, in order to explore the role drug use plays in sexual risk. The analysis reveals important connections between risky behavior, drug usage, and sexual risk."}
{"text": "  Stability is an important aspect of a classification procedure because unstable predictions can potentially reduce users' trust in a classification system and also harm the reproducibility of scientific conclusions. The major goal of our work is to introduce a novel concept of classification instability, i.e., decision boundary instability (DBI), and incorporate it with the generalization error (GE) as a standard for selecting the most accurate and stable classifier. Specifically, we implement a two-stage algorithm: (i) initially select a subset of classifiers whose estimated GEs are not significantly different from the minimal estimated GE among all the candidate classifiers; (ii) the optimal classifier is chosen as the one achieving the minimal DBI among the subset selected in stage (i). This general selection principle applies to both linear and nonlinear classifiers. Large-margin classifiers are used as a prototypical example to illustrate the above idea. Our selection method is shown to be consistent in the sense that the optimal classifier simultaneously achieves the minimal GE and the minimal DBI. Various simulations and real examples further demonstrate the advantage of our method over several alternative approaches."}
{"text": "  Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified."}
{"text": "  In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach is utilized to perform a parametric study on the process of extraction of lubricants from heavy petroleum cuts. To train the model, we used field data collected from an industrial plant. Operational conditions of feed and solvent flow rate, Temperature of streams and mixing rate were considered as the input to the model, whereas the flow rate of the main product was considered as the output of the ANN model. A feed-forward Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network was successfully applied to capture the relationship between inputs and output parameters."}
{"text": "  We consider the demixing problem of two (or more) high-dimensional vectors from nonlinear observations when the number of such observations is far less than the ambient dimension of the underlying vectors. Specifically, we demonstrate an algorithm that stably estimate the underlying components under general \\emph{structured sparsity} assumptions on these components. Specifically, we show that for certain types of structured superposition models, our method provably recovers the components given merely $n = \\mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$ denotes the number of nonzero entries in the underlying components. Moreover, our method achieves a fast (linear) convergence rate, and also exhibits fast (near-linear) per-iteration complexity for certain types of structured models. We also provide a range of simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "  Random sinusoidal features are a popular approach for speeding up kernel-based inference in large datasets. Prior to the inference stage, the approach suggests performing dimensionality reduction by first multiplying each data vector by a random Gaussian matrix, and then computing an element-wise sinusoid. Theoretical analysis shows that collecting a sufficient number of such features can be reliably used for subsequent inference in kernel classification and regression.   In this work, we demonstrate that with a mild increase in the dimension of the embedding, it is also possible to reconstruct the data vector from such random sinusoidal features, provided that the underlying data is sparse enough. In particular, we propose a numerically stable algorithm for reconstructing the data vector given the nonlinear features, and analyze its sample complexity. Our algorithm can be extended to other types of structured inverse problems, such as demixing a pair of sparse (but incoherent) vectors. We support the efficacy of our approach via numerical experiments."}
{"text": "  Contextual bandit algorithms -- a class of multi-armed bandit algorithms that exploit the contextual information -- have been shown to be effective in solving sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. A common assumption adopted in the literature is that the realized (ground truth) reward by taking the selected action is observed by the learner at no cost, which, however, is not realistic in many practical scenarios. When observing the ground truth reward is costly, a key challenge for the learner is how to judiciously acquire the ground truth by assessing the benefits and costs in order to balance learning efficiency and learning cost. From the information theoretic perspective, a perhaps even more interesting question is how much efficiency might be lost due to this cost. In this paper, we design a novel contextual bandit-based learning algorithm and endow it with the active learning capability. The key feature of our algorithm is that in addition to sending a query to an annotator for the ground truth, prior information about the ground truth learned by the learner is sent together, thereby reducing the query cost. We prove that by carefully choosing the algorithm parameters, the learning regret of the proposed algorithm achieves the same order as that of conventional contextual bandit algorithms in cost-free scenarios, implying that, surprisingly, cost due to acquiring the ground truth does not increase the learning regret in the long-run. Our analysis shows that prior information about the ground truth plays a critical role in improving the system performance in scenarios where active learning is necessary."}
{"text": "  Heavy-tailed distributions are widely used in robust mixture modelling due to possessing thick tails. As a computationally tractable subclass of the stable distributions, sub-Gaussian $\\alpha$-stable distribution received much interest in the literature. Here, we introduce a type of expectation maximization algorithm that estimates parameters of a mixture of sub-Gaussian stable distributions. A comparative study, in the presence of some well-known mixture models, is performed to show the robustness and performance of the mixture of sub-Gaussian $\\alpha$-stable distributions for modelling, simulated, synthetic, and real data."}
{"text": "  We propose a neural network based approach for learning topics from text and image datasets. The model makes no assumptions about the conditional distribution of the observed features given the latent topics. This allows us to perform topic modelling efficiently using sentences of documents and patches of images as observed features, rather than limiting ourselves to words. Moreover, the proposed approach is online, and hence can be used for streaming data. Furthermore, since the approach utilizes neural networks, it can be implemented on GPU with ease, and hence it is very scalable."}
{"text": "  Learning algorithms that learn linear models often have high representation bias on real-world problems. In this paper, we show that this representation bias can be greatly reduced by discretization. Discretization is a common procedure in machine learning that is used to convert a quantitative attribute into a qualitative one. It is often motivated by the limitation of some learners to qualitative data. Discretization loses information, as fewer distinctions between instances are possible using discretized data relative to undiscretized data. In consequence, where discretization is not essential, it might appear desirable to avoid it. However, it has been shown that discretization often substantially reduces the error of the linear generative Bayesian classifier naive Bayes. This motivates a systematic study of the effectiveness of discretizing quantitative attributes for other linear classifiers. In this work, we study the effect of discretization on the performance of linear classifiers optimizing three distinct discriminative objective functions --- logistic regression (optimizing negative log-likelihood), support vector classifiers (optimizing hinge loss) and a zero-hidden layer artificial neural network (optimizing mean-square-error). We show that discretization can greatly increase the accuracy of these linear discriminative learners by reducing their representation bias, especially on big datasets. We substantiate our claims with an empirical study on $42$ benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has shown a great success in many areas including complex image classification tasks. However, they need a lot of memory and computational cost, which hinders them from running in relatively low-end smart devices such as smart phones. We propose a CNN compression method based on CP-decomposition and Tensor Power Method. We also propose an iterative fine tuning, with which we fine-tune the whole network after decomposing each layer, but before decomposing the next layer. Significant reduction in memory and computation cost is achieved compared to state-of-the-art previous work with no more accuracy loss."}

{"text": "  To cope with changing environments, recent developments in online learning have introduced the concepts of adaptive regret and dynamic regret independently. In this paper, we illustrate an intrinsic connection between these two concepts by showing that the dynamic regret can be expressed in terms of the adaptive regret and the functional variation. This observation implies that strongly adaptive algorithms can be directly leveraged to minimize the dynamic regret. As a result, we present a series of strongly adaptive algorithms that have small dynamic regrets for convex functions, exponentially concave functions, and strongly convex functions, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that exponential concavity is utilized to upper bound the dynamic regret. Moreover, all of those adaptive algorithms do not need any prior knowledge of the functional variation, which is a significant advantage over previous specialized methods for minimizing dynamic regret."}
{"text": "  Machine learning models, such as neural networks, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, accept a feature vector, and provide a prediction. These models learn in a supervised fashion where we provide feature vectors mapped to the expected output. It is common practice to engineer new features from the provided feature set. Such engineered features will either augment or replace portions of the existing feature vector. These engineered features are essentially calculated fields based on the values of the other features.   Engineering such features is primarily a manual, time-consuming task. Additionally, each type of model will respond differently to different kinds of engineered features. This paper reports empirical research to demonstrate what kinds of engineered features are best suited to various machine learning model types. We provide this recommendation by generating several datasets that we designed to benefit from a particular type of engineered feature. The experiment demonstrates to what degree the machine learning model can synthesize the needed feature on its own. If a model can synthesize a planned feature, it is not necessary to provide that feature. The research demonstrated that the studied models do indeed perform differently with various types of engineered features."}
{"text": "  Subset selection in multiple linear regression aims to choose a subset of candidate explanatory variables that tradeoff fitting error (explanatory power) and model complexity (number of variables selected). We build mathematical programming models for regression subset selection based on mean square and absolute errors, and minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criteria. The proposed models are tested using a linear-program-based branch-and-bound algorithm with tailored valid inequalities and big M values and are compared against the algorithms in the literature. For high dimensional cases, an iterative heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the mathematical programming models and a core set concept, and a randomized version of the algorithm is derived to guarantee convergence to the global optimum. From the computational experiments, we find that our models quickly find a quality solution while the rest of the time is spent to prove optimality; the iterative algorithms find solutions in a relatively short time and are competitive compared to state-of-the-art algorithms; using ad-hoc big M values is not recommended."}
{"text": "  Given functional data from a survival process with time-dependent covariates, we derive a smooth convex representation for its nonparametric log-likelihood functional and obtain its functional gradient. From this we devise a generic gradient boosting procedure for estimating the hazard function nonparametrically. An illustrative implementation of the procedure using regression trees is described to show how to recover the unknown hazard. We show that the generic estimator is consistent if the model is correctly specified; alternatively an oracle inequality can be demonstrated for tree-based models. To avoid overfitting, boosting employs several regularization devices. One of them is step-size restriction, but the rationale for this is somewhat mysterious from the viewpoint of consistency. Our work brings some clarity to this issue by revealing that step-size restriction is a mechanism for preventing the curvature of the risk from derailing convergence."}
{"text": "  Prototypal analysis is introduced to overcome two shortcomings of archetypal analysis: its sensitivity to outliers and its non-locality, which reduces its applicability as a learning tool. Same as archetypal analysis, prototypal analysis finds prototypes through convex combination of the data points and approximates the data through convex combination of the archetypes, but it adds a penalty for using prototypes distant from the data points for their reconstruction. Prototypal analysis can be extended---via kernel embedding---to probability distributions, since the convexity of the prototypes makes them interpretable as mixtures. Finally, prototypal regression is developed, a robust supervised procedure which allows the use of distributions as either features or labels."}
{"text": "  We start with an overview of a class of submodular functions called SCMMs (sums of concave composed with non-negative modular functions plus a final arbitrary modular). We then define a new class of submodular functions we call {\\em deep submodular functions} or DSFs. We show that DSFs are a flexible parametric family of submodular functions that share many of the properties and advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs). DSFs can be motivated by considering a hierarchy of descriptive concepts over ground elements and where one wishes to allow submodular interaction throughout this hierarchy. Results in this paper show that DSFs constitute a strictly larger class of submodular functions than SCMMs. We show that, for any integer $k>0$, there are $k$-layer DSFs that cannot be represented by a $k'$-layer DSF for any $k'<k$. This implies that, like DNNs, there is a utility to depth, but unlike DNNs, the family of DSFs strictly increase with depth. Despite this, we show (using a \"backpropagation\" like method) that DSFs, even with arbitrarily large $k$, do not comprise all submodular functions. In offering the above results, we also define the notion of an antitone superdifferential of a concave function and show how this relates to submodular functions (in general), DSFs (in particular), negative second-order partial derivatives, continuous submodularity, and concave extensions. To further motivate our analysis, we provide various special case results from matroid theory, comparing DSFs with forms of matroid rank, in particular the laminar matroid. Lastly, we discuss strategies to learn DSFs, and define the classes of deep supermodular functions, deep difference of submodular functions, and deep multivariate submodular functions, and discuss where these can be useful in applications."}
{"text": "  Forward regression is a statistical model selection and estimation procedure which inductively selects covariates that add predictive power into a working statistical regression model. Once a model is selected, unknown regression parameters are estimated by least squares. This paper analyzes forward regression in high-dimensional sparse linear models. Probabilistic bounds for prediction error norm and number of selected covariates are proved. The analysis in this paper gives sharp rates and does not require beta-min or irrepresentability conditions."}
{"text": "  This paper presents a novel data-driven technique based on the spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) for energy/power prediction for complex dynamical systems. Built on symbolic dynamic filtering, the STPN framework is used to capture not only the individual system characteristics but also the pair-wise causal dependencies among different sub-systems. For quantifying the causal dependency, a mutual information based metric is presented. An energy prediction approach is subsequently proposed based on the STPN framework. For validating the proposed scheme, two case studies are presented, one involving wind turbine power prediction (supply side energy) using the Western Wind Integration data set generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics, and the other, residential electric energy disaggregation (demand side energy) using the Building America 2010 data set from NREL for exploring the temporal features. In the energy disaggregation context, convex programming techniques beyond the STPN framework are developed and applied to achieve improved disaggregation performance."}
{"text": "  A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.   In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and other heuristics for posterior estimation."}
{"text": "  A task of clustering data given in the ordinal scale under conditions of overlapping clusters has been considered. It's proposed to use an approach based on memberhsip and likelihood functions sharing. A number of performed experiments proved effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method is characterized by robustness to outliers due to a way of ordering values while constructing membership functions."}
{"text": "  Consumer Demand Response (DR) is an important research and industry problem, which seeks to categorize, predict and modify consumer's energy consumption. Unfortunately, traditional clustering methods have resulted in many hundreds of clusters, with a given consumer often associated with several clusters, making it difficult to classify consumers into stable representative groups and to predict individual energy consumption patterns. In this paper, we present a shape-based approach that better classifies and predicts consumer energy consumption behavior at the household level. The method is based on Dynamic Time Warping. DTW seeks an optimal alignment between energy consumption patterns reflecting the effect of hidden patterns of regular consumer behavior. Using real consumer 24-hour load curves from Opower Corporation, our method results in a 50% reduction in the number of representative groups and an improvement in prediction accuracy measured under DTW distance. We extend the approach to estimate which electrical devices will be used and in which hours."}
{"text": "  Class imbalance is one of the challenging problems for machine learning in many real-world applications, such as coal and gas burst accident monitoring: the burst premonition data is extreme smaller than the normal data, however, which is the highlight we truly focus on. Cost-sensitive adjustment approach is a typical algorithm-level method resisting the data set imbalance. For SVMs classifier, which is modified to incorporate varying penalty parameter(C) for each of considered groups of examples. However, the C value is determined empirically, or is calculated according to the evaluation metric, which need to be computed iteratively and time consuming. This paper presents a novel cost-sensitive SVM method whose penalty parameter C optimized on the basis of cluster probability density function(PDF) and the cluster PDF is estimated only according to similarity matrix and some predefined hyper-parameters. Experimental results on various standard benchmark data sets and real-world data with different ratios of imbalance show that the proposed method is effective in comparison with commonly used cost-sensitive techniques."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose to equip Generative Adversarial Networks with the ability to produce direct energy estimates for samples.Specifically, we propose a flexible adversarial training framework, and prove this framework not only ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution, but also enables the discriminator to retain the density information at the global optimal. We derive the analytic form of the induced solution, and analyze the properties. In order to make the proposed framework trainable in practice, we introduce two effective approximation techniques. Empirically, the experiment results closely match our theoretical analysis, verifying the discriminator is able to recover the energy of data distribution."}
{"text": "  This paper proposes a hierarchical feature extractor for non-stationary streaming time series based on the concept of switching observable Markov chain models. The slow time-scale non-stationary behaviors are considered to be a mixture of quasi-stationary fast time-scale segments that are exhibited by complex dynamical systems. The idea is to model each unique stationary characteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique characteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one low-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in the recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build an online algorithm suited for handling quasi-stationary data at a lower level and a non-stationary behavior at a higher level without a priori knowledge. A key observation made in this study is that the rate of change of data likelihood seems to be a better indicator of change in data characteristics compared to the traditional methods that mostly consider data likelihood for change detection. The algorithm minimizes model complexity and captures data likelihood. Efficacy demonstration and comparative evaluation of the proposed algorithm are performed using time series data simulated from systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. We discuss results that show that the proposed hierarchical SDF algorithm can identify underlying features with significantly high degree of accuracy, even under very noisy conditions. Algorithm is demonstrated to perform better than the baseline Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The low computational complexity of algorithm makes it suitable for on-board, real time operations."}
{"text": "  Although there exist plentiful theories of empirical risk minimization (ERM) for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM for a related problem---stochastic convex optimization (SCO), are limited. In this work, we strengthen the realm of ERM for SCO by exploiting smoothness and strong convexity conditions to improve the risk bounds. First, we establish an $\\widetilde{O}(d/n + \\sqrt{F_*/n})$ risk bound when the random function is nonnegative, convex and smooth, and the expected function is Lipschitz continuous, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number of samples, and $F_*$ is the minimal risk. Thus, when $F_*$ is small we obtain an $\\widetilde{O}(d/n)$ risk bound, which is analogous to the $\\widetilde{O}(1/n)$ optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning. Second, if the objective function is also $\\lambda$-strongly convex, we prove an $\\widetilde{O}(d/n + \\kappa F_*/n )$ risk bound where $\\kappa$ is the condition number, and improve it to $O(1/[\\lambda n^2] + \\kappa F_*/n)$ when $n=\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\kappa d)$. As a result, we obtain an $O(\\kappa/n^2)$ risk bound under the condition that $n$ is large and $F_*$ is small, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first $O(1/n^2)$-type of risk bound of ERM. Third, we stress that the above results are established in a unified framework, which allows us to derive new risk bounds under weaker conditions, e.g., without convexity of the random function and Lipschitz continuity of the expected function. Finally, we demonstrate that to achieve an $O(1/[\\lambda n^2] + \\kappa F_*/n)$ risk bound for supervised learning, the $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\kappa d)$ requirement on $n$ can be replaced with $\\Omega(\\kappa^2)$, which is dimensionality-independent."}
{"text": "  We introduce a new model of teaching named \"preference-based teaching\" and a corresponding complexity parameter---the preference-based teaching dimension (PBTD)---representing the worst-case number of examples needed to teach any concept in a given concept class. Although the PBTD coincides with the well-known recursive teaching dimension (RTD) on finite classes, it is radically different on infinite ones: the RTD becomes infinite already for trivial infinite classes (such as half-intervals) whereas the PBTD evaluates to reasonably small values for a wide collection of infinite classes including classes consisting of so-called closed sets w.r.t. a given closure operator, including various classes related to linear sets over $\\mathbb{N}_0$ (whose RTD had been studied quite recently) and including the class of Euclidean half-spaces. On top of presenting these concrete results, we provide the reader with a theoretical framework (of a combinatorial flavor) which helps to derive bounds on the PBTD."}
{"text": "  Parametric density estimation, for example as Gaussian distribution, is the base of the field of statistics. Machine learning requires inexpensive estimation of much more complex densities, and the basic approach is relatively costly maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). There will be discussed inexpensive density estimation, for example literally fitting a polynomial (or Fourier series) to the sample, which coefficients are calculated by just averaging monomials (or sine/cosine) over the sample. Another discussed basic application is fitting distortion to some standard distribution like Gaussian - analogously to ICA, but additionally allowing to reconstruct the disturbed density. Finally, by using weighted average, it can be also applied for estimation of non-probabilistic densities, like modelling mass distribution, or for various clustering problems by using negative (or complex) weights: fitting a function which sign (or argument) determines clusters. The estimated parameters are approaching the optimal values with error dropping like $1/\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the sample size."}
{"text": "  In this work a robust clustering algorithm for stationary time series is proposed. The algorithm is based on the use of estimated spectral densities, which are considered as functional data, as the basic characteristic of stationary time series for clustering purposes. A robust algorithm for functional data is then applied to the set of spectral densities. Trimming techniques and restrictions on the scatter within groups reduce the effect of noise in the data and help to prevent the identification of spurious clusters. The procedure is tested in a simulation study, and is also applied to a real data set."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we tackle the problem of transferring policy from multiple partially observable source environments to a partially observable target environment modeled as predictive state representation. This is an entirely new approach with no previous work, other than the case of transfer in fully observable domains. We develop algorithms to successfully achieve policy transfer when we have the model of both the source and target tasks and discuss in detail their performance and shortcomings. These algorithms could be a starting point for the field of transfer learning in partial observability."}
{"text": "  The generalization and robustness of an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computer aided diagnostic system are crucial requirements in actual clinical practice. To reach these goals, we propose a new EEG representation that provides a more realistic view of brain functionality by applying multi-instance (MI) framework to consider the non-stationarity of the EEG signal. The non-stationary characteristic of EEG is considered by describing the signal as a bag of relevant and irrelevant concepts. The concepts are provided by a robust representation of homogenous segments of EEG signal using spatial covariance matrices. Due to the nonlinear geometry of the space of covariance matrices, we determine the boundaries of the homogeneous segments based on adaptive segmentation of the signal in a Riemannian framework. Each subject is described as a bag of covariance matrices of homogenous segments and the bag-level discriminative information is used for classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we examine it in attention deficit hyperactivity/bipolar mood disorder detection and depression/normal diagnosis applications. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, which is gained due to the robustness of covariance descriptor, the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry, and the benefits of considering the inherent non-stationary nature of the brain."}
{"text": "  To estimate the value functions of policies from exploratory data, most model-free off-policy algorithms rely on importance sampling, where the use of importance sampling ratios often leads to estimates with severe variance. It is thus desirable to learn off-policy without using the ratios. However, such an algorithm does not exist for multi-step learning with function approximation. In this paper, we introduce the first such algorithm based on temporal-difference (TD) learning updates. We show that an explicit use of importance sampling ratios can be eliminated by varying the amount of bootstrapping in TD updates in an action-dependent manner. Our new algorithm achieves stability using a two-timescale gradient-based TD update. A prior algorithm based on lookup table representation called Tree Backup can also be retrieved using action-dependent bootstrapping, becoming a special case of our algorithm. In two challenging off-policy tasks, we demonstrate that our algorithm is stable, effectively avoids the large variance issue, and can perform substantially better than its state-of-the-art counterpart."}
{"text": "  The follow the leader (FTL) algorithm, perhaps the simplest of all online learning algorithms, is known to perform well when the loss functions it is used on are convex and positively curved. In this paper we ask whether there are other \"lucky\" settings when FTL achieves sublinear, \"small\" regret. In particular, we study the fundamental problem of linear prediction over a non-empty convex, compact domain. Amongst other results, we prove that the curvature of the boundary of the domain can act as if the losses were curved: In this case, we prove that as long as the mean of the loss vectors have positive lengths bounded away from zero, FTL enjoys a logarithmic growth rate of regret, while, e.g., for polytope domains and stochastic data it enjoys finite expected regret. Building on a previously known meta-algorithm, we also get an algorithm that simultaneously enjoys the worst-case guarantees and the bound available for FTL."}
{"text": "  In recent years, neural networks have enjoyed a renaissance as function approximators in reinforcement learning. Two decades after Tesauro's TD-Gammon achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600 games. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we propose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU). The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by its input. Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and softmax action selection with simple annealing can be competitive with DQN, without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10$\\times$10 board, using TD($\\lambda$) learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa($\\lambda$) agent with SiLU and dSiLU hidden units."}
{"text": "  Batch Normalization is quite effective at accelerating and improving the training of deep models. However, its effectiveness diminishes when the training minibatches are small, or do not consist of independent samples. We hypothesize that this is due to the dependence of model layer inputs on all the examples in the minibatch, and different activations being produced between training and inference. We propose Batch Renormalization, a simple and effective extension to ensure that the training and inference models generate the same outputs that depend on individual examples rather than the entire minibatch. Models trained with Batch Renormalization perform substantially better than batchnorm when training with small or non-i.i.d. minibatches. At the same time, Batch Renormalization retains the benefits of batchnorm such as insensitivity to initialization and training efficiency."}
{"text": "  Incremental learning with concept drift has often been tackled by ensemble methods, where models built in the past can be re-trained to attain new models for the current data. Two design questions need to be addressed in developing ensemble methods for incremental learning with concept drift, i.e., which historical (i.e., previously trained) models should be preserved and how to utilize them. A novel ensemble learning method, namely Diversity and Transfer based Ensemble Learning (DTEL), is proposed in this paper. Given newly arrived data, DTEL uses each preserved historical model as an initial model and further trains it with the new data via transfer learning. Furthermore, DTEL preserves a diverse set of historical models, rather than a set of historical models that are merely accurate in terms of classification accuracy. Empirical studies on 15 synthetic data streams and 4 real-world data streams (all with concept drifts) demonstrate that DTEL can handle concept drift more effectively than 4 other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  We propose a framework for modeling and estimating the state of controlled dynamical systems, where an agent can affect the system through actions and receives partial observations. Based on this framework, we propose the Predictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFFPSR). A key property in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditional distribution of future observations given future actions. RFF-PSRs combine this representation with moment-matching, kernel embedding and local optimization to achieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can represent controlled environments which can be affected by actions; it has an efficient and theoretically justified learning algorithm; it uses a non-parametric representation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-linear dynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method."}
{"text": "  As data collections become larger, exploratory regression analysis becomes more important but more challenging. When observations are hierarchically clustered the problem is even more challenging because model selection with mixed effect models can produce misleading results when nonlinear effects are not included into the model (Bauer and Cai, 2009). A machine learning method called boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001) is a good approach for exploratory regression analysis in real data sets because it can detect predictors with nonlinear and interaction effects while also accounting for missing data. We propose an extension to boosted decision decision trees called metboost for hierarchically clustered data. It works by constraining the structure of each tree to be the same across groups, but allowing the terminal node means to differ. This allows predictors and split points to lead to different predictions within each group, and approximates nonlinear group specific effects. Importantly, metboost remains computationally feasible for thousands of observations and hundreds of predictors that may contain missing values. We apply the method to predict math performance for 15,240 students from 751 schools in data collected in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002 (Ingels et al., 2007), allowing 76 predictors to have unique effects for each school. When comparing results to boosted decision trees, metboost has 15% improved prediction performance. Results of a large simulation study show that metboost has up to 70% improved variable selection performance and up to 30% improved prediction performance compared to boosted decision trees when group sizes are small"}
{"text": "  Statistical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) allows researchers to study local climate change effects decades into the future. A wide range of statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in machine learning have not been explored. In this paper, we compare four fundamental statistical methods, Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD), Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine, with three more advanced machine learning methods, Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning (MSSL), BCSD coupled with MSSL, and Convolutional Neural Networks to downscale daily precipitation in the Northeast United States. Metrics to evaluate of each method's ability to capture daily anomalies, large scale climate shifts, and extremes are analyzed. We find that linear methods, led by BCSD, consistently outperform non-linear approaches. The direct application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches."}
{"text": "  Flow cytometry is a high-throughput technology used to quantify multiple surface and intracellular markers at the level of a single cell. This enables to identify cell sub-types, and to determine their relative proportions. Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells from a blood sample using multiple markers. This results in high-dimensional datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent (e.g. longitudinal studies). Here, we propose to use a Bayesian nonparametric approach with Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of multivariate skew $t$-distributions to perform model based clustering of flow-cytometry data. DPM models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding model selection issues, and skew $t$-distributions provides robustness to outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the DALIA-1 data. We have made the method available for the community in the R package NPflow."}
{"text": "  A large portion of data mining and analytic services use modern machine learning techniques, such as deep learning. The state-of-the-art results by deep learning come at the price of an intensive use of computing resources. The leading frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) are executed on GPUs or on high-end servers in datacenters. On the other end, there is a proliferation of personal devices with possibly free CPU cycles; this can enable services to run in users' homes, embedding machine learning operations. In this paper, we ask the following question: Is distributed deep learning computation on WAN connected devices feasible, in spite of the traffic caused by learning tasks? We show that such a setup rises some important challenges, most notably the ingress traffic that the servers hosting the up-to-date model have to sustain.   In order to reduce this stress, we propose adaComp, a novel algorithm for compressing worker updates to the model on the server. Applicable to stochastic gradient descent based approaches, it combines efficient gradient selection and learning rate modulation. We then experiment and measure the impact of compression, device heterogeneity and reliability on the accuracy of learned models, with an emulator platform that embeds TensorFlow into Linux containers. We report a reduction of the total amount of data sent by workers to the server by two order of magnitude (e.g., 191-fold reduction for a convolutional network on the MNIST dataset), when compared to a standard asynchronous stochastic gradient descent, while preserving model accuracy."}
{"text": "  Many modern data sets are sampled with error from complex high-dimensional surfaces. Methods such as tensor product splines or Gaussian processes are effective/well suited for characterizing a surface in two or three dimensions but may suffer from difficulties when representing higher dimensional surfaces. Motivated by high throughput toxicity testing where observed dose-response curves are cross sections of a surface defined by a chemical's structural properties, a model is developed to characterize this surface to predict untested chemicals' dose-responses. This manuscript proposes a novel approach that models the multidimensional surface as a sum of learned basis functions formed as the tensor product of lower dimensional functions, which are themselves representable by a basis expansion learned from the data. The model is described, a Gibbs sampling algorithm proposed, and is investigated in a simulation study as well as data taken from the US EPA's ToxCast high throughput toxicity testing platform."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we study a variant of the framework of online learning using expert advice with limited/bandit feedback. We consider each expert as a learning entity, seeking to more accurately reflecting certain real-world applications. In our setting, the feedback at any time $t$ is limited in a sense that it is only available to the expert $i^t$ that has been selected by the central algorithm (forecaster), \\emph{i.e.}, only the expert $i^t$ receives feedback from the environment and gets to learn at time $t$. We consider a generic black-box approach whereby the forecaster does not control or know the learning dynamics of the experts apart from knowing the following no-regret learning property: the average regret of any expert $j$ vanishes at a rate of at least $O(t_j^{\\regretRate-1})$ with $t_j$ learning steps where $\\regretRate \\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter.   In the spirit of competing against the best action in hindsight in multi-armed bandits problem, our goal here is to be competitive w.r.t. the cumulative losses the algorithm could receive by following the policy of always selecting one expert. We prove the following hardness result: without any coordination between the forecaster and the experts, it is impossible to design a forecaster achieving no-regret guarantees. In order to circumvent this hardness result, we consider a practical assumption allowing the forecaster to \"guide\" the learning process of the experts by filtering/blocking some of the feedbacks observed by them from the environment, \\emph{i.e.}, not allowing the selected expert $i^t$ to learn at time $t$ for some time steps. Then, we design a novel no-regret learning algorithm \\algo for this problem setting by carefully guiding the feedbacks observed by experts. We prove that \\algo achieves the worst-case expected cumulative regret of $O(\\Time^\\frac{1}{2 - \\regretRate})$ after $\\Time$ time steps."}
{"text": "  We study additive models built with trend filtering, i.e., additive models whose components are each regularized by the (discrete) total variation of their $k$th (discrete) derivative, for a chosen integer $k \\geq 0$. This results in $k$th degree piecewise polynomial components, (e.g., $k=0$ gives piecewise constant components, $k=1$ gives piecewise linear, $k=2$ gives piecewise quadratic, etc.). Analogous to its advantages in the univariate case, additive trend filtering has favorable theoretical and computational properties, thanks in large part to the localized nature of the (discrete) total variation regularizer that it uses. On the theory side, we derive fast error rates for additive trend filtering estimates, and show these rates are minimax optimal when the underlying function is additive and has component functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation. We also show that these rates are unattainable by additive smoothing splines (and by additive models built from linear smoothers, in general). On the computational side, as per the standard in additive models, backfitting is an appealing method for optimization, but it is particularly appealing for additive trend filtering because we can leverage a few highly efficient univariate trend filtering solvers. Going one step further, we describe a new backfitting algorithm whose iterations can be run in parallel, which (as far as we know) is the first of its kind. Lastly, we present experiments to examine the empirical performance of additive trend filtering."}
{"text": "  Estimating the state of a dynamical system from a series of noise-corrupted observations is fundamental in many areas of science and engineering. The most well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. Finally, we empirically validate our approach via the analysis of measured brain signals."}
{"text": "  This paper introduces a method for efficiently inferring a high-dimensional distributed quantity from a few observations. The quantity of interest (QoI) is approximated in a basis (dictionary) learned from a training set. The coefficients associated with the approximation of the QoI in the basis are determined by minimizing the misfit with the observations. To obtain a probabilistic estimate of the quantity of interest, a Bayesian approach is employed. The QoI is treated as a random field endowed with a hierarchical prior distribution so that closed-form expressions can be obtained for the posterior distribution. The main contribution of the present work lies in the derivation of \\emph{a representation basis consistent with the observation chain} used to infer the associated coefficients. The resulting dictionary is then tailored to be both observable by the sensors and accurate in approximating the posterior mean. An algorithm for deriving such an observable dictionary is presented. The method is illustrated with the estimation of the velocity field of an open cavity flow from a handful of wall-mounted point sensors. Comparison with standard estimation approaches relying on Principal Component Analysis and K-SVD dictionaries is provided and illustrates the superior performance of the present approach."}
{"text": "  We show the equivalence of two state-of-the-art link prediction/knowledge graph completion methods: Nickel et al's holographic embedding and Trouillon et al.'s complex embedding. We first consider a spectral version of the holographic embedding, exploiting the frequency domain in the Fourier transform for efficient computation. The analysis of the resulting method reveals that it can be viewed as an instance of the complex embedding with certain constraints cast on the initial vectors upon training. Conversely, any complex embedding can be converted to an equivalent holographic embedding."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of outlier robust PCA (OR-PCA) where the goal is to recover principal directions despite the presence of outlier data points. That is, given a data matrix $M^*$, where $(1-\\alpha)$ fraction of the points are noisy samples from a low-dimensional subspace while $\\alpha$ fraction of the points can be arbitrary outliers, the goal is to recover the subspace accurately. Existing results for \\OR-PCA have serious drawbacks: while some results are quite weak in the presence of noise, other results have runtime quadratic in dimension, rendering them impractical for large scale applications.   In this work, we provide a novel thresholding based iterative algorithm with per-iteration complexity at most linear in the data size. Moreover, the fraction of outliers, $\\alpha$, that our method can handle is tight up to constants while providing nearly optimal computational complexity for a general noise setting. For the special case where the inliers are obtained from a low-dimensional subspace with additive Gaussian noise, we show that a modification of our thresholding based method leads to significant improvement in recovery error (of the subspace) even in the presence of a large fraction of outliers."}
{"text": "  Deep neural networks are currently among the most commonly used classifiers. Despite easily achieving very good performance, one of the best selling points of these models is their modular design - one can conveniently adapt their architecture to specific needs, change connectivity patterns, attach specialised layers, experiment with a large amount of activation functions, normalisation schemes and many others. While one can find impressively wide spread of various configurations of almost every aspect of the deep nets, one element is, in authors' opinion, underrepresented - while solving classification problems, vast majority of papers and applications simply use log loss. In this paper we try to investigate how particular choices of loss functions affect deep models and their learning dynamics, as well as resulting classifiers robustness to various effects. We perform experiments on classical datasets, as well as provide some additional, theoretical insights into the problem. In particular we show that L1 and L2 losses are, quite surprisingly, justified classification objectives for deep nets, by providing probabilistic interpretation in terms of expected misclassification. We also introduce two losses which are not typically used as deep nets objectives and show that they are viable alternatives to the existing ones."}

We prove that SAGA enjoys the linear convergence rate up to the statistical estimation accuracy, under the assumption of restricted strong convexity (RSC).

{"text": "  Background: Statistical mechanics results (Dauphin et al. (2014); Choromanska et al. (2015)) suggest that local minima with high error are exponentially rare in high dimensions. However, to prove low error guarantees for Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs), previous works so far required either a heavily modified MNN model or training method, strong assumptions on the labels (e.g., \"near\" linear separability), or an unrealistic hidden layer with $\\Omega\\left(N\\right)$ units.   Results: We examine a MNN with one hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a single output, and a quadratic loss. We prove that, with high probability in the limit of $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ datapoints, the volume of differentiable regions of the empiric loss containing sub-optimal differentiable local minima is exponentially vanishing in comparison with the same volume of global minima, given standard normal input of dimension $d_{0}=\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\sqrt{N}\\right)$, and a more realistic number of $d_{1}=\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(N/d_{0}\\right)$ hidden units.

{"text": "  Besides independent learning, human learning process is highly improved by summarizing what has been learned, communicating it with peers, and subsequently fusing knowledge from different sources to assist the current learning goal. This collaborative learning procedure ensures that the knowledge is shared, continuously refined, and concluded from different perspectives to construct a more profound understanding. The idea of knowledge transfer has led to many advances in machine learning and data mining, but significant challenges remain, especially when it comes to reinforcement learning, heterogeneous model structures, and different learning tasks. Motivated by human collaborative learning, in this paper we propose a collaborative deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) framework that performs adaptive knowledge transfer among heterogeneous learning agents. Specifically, the proposed CDRL conducts a novel deep knowledge distillation method to address the heterogeneity among different learning tasks with a deep alignment network. Furthermore, we present an efficient collaborative Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (cA3C) algorithm to incorporate deep knowledge distillation into the online training of agents, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the CDRL framework using extensive empirical evaluation on OpenAI gym."}

We show that a post-hoc correction approach, as suggested by Hardt et al, can be highly suboptimal, present a nearly-optimal statistical procedure, argue that the associated computational problem is intractable, and suggest a second moment relaxation of the non-discrimination definition for which learning is tractable."}
{"text": "  In information retrieval, learning to rank constructs a machine-based ranking model which given a query, sorts the search results by their degree of relevance or importance to the query. Neural networks have been successfully applied to this problem, and in this paper, we propose an attention-based deep neural network which better incorporates different embeddings of the queries and search results with an attention-based mechanism. This model also applies a decoder mechanism to learn the ranks of the search results in a listwise fashion. The embeddings are trained with convolutional neural networks or the word2vec model.

{"text": "  We prove in this paper that the expected value of the objective function of the $k$-means++ algorithm for samples converges to population expected value. As $k$-means++, for samples, provides with constant factor approximation for $k$-means objectives, such an approximation can be achieved for the population with increase of the sample size.   This result is of potential practical relevance when one is considering using subsampling when clustering large data sets (large data bases)."}
{"text": "  Hypothesis tests in models whose dimension far exceeds the sample size can be formulated much like the classical studentized tests only after the initial bias of estimation is removed successfully. The theory of debiased estimators can be developed in the context of quantile regression models for a fixed quantile value. However, it is frequently desirable to formulate tests based on the quantile regression process, as this leads to more robust tests and more stable confidence sets. Additionally, inference in quantile regression requires estimation of the so called sparsity function, which depends on the unknown density of the error. In this paper we consider a debiasing approach for the uniform testing problem. We develop high-dimensional regression rank scores and show how to use them to estimate the sparsity function, as well as how to adapt them for inference involving the quantile regression process. Furthermore, we develop a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in a location-shift high-dimensional models and confidence sets that are uniformly valid for many quantile values. The main technical result are the development of a Bahadur representation of the debiasing estimator that is uniform over a range of quantiles and uniform convergence of the quantile process to the Brownian bridge process, which are of independent interest. Simulation studies illustrate finite sample properties of our procedure."}
{"text": "  Many statistical learning problems can be posed as minimization of a sum of two convex functions, one typically a composition of non-smooth and linear functions. Examples include regression under structured sparsity assumptions. Popular algorithms for solving such problems, e.g., ADMM, often involve non-trivial optimization subproblems or smoothing approximation. We consider two classes of primal-dual algorithms that do not incur these difficulties, and unify them from a perspective of monotone operator theory. From this unification we propose a continuum of preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting algorithms amenable to parallel and distributed computing. For the entire region of convergence of the whole continuum of algorithms, we establish its rates of convergence. For some known instances of this continuum, our analysis closes the gap in theory. We further exploit the unification to propose a continuum of accelerated algorithms. We show that the whole continuum attains the theoretically optimal rate of convergence. The scalability of the proposed algorithms, as well as their convergence behavior, is demonstrated up to 1.2 million variables with a distributed implementation."}
{"text": "  We present and analyze an approach for distributed stochastic optimization which is statistically optimal and achieves near-linear speedups (up to logarithmic factors). Our approach allows a communication-memory tradeoff, with either logarithmic communication but linear memory, or polynomial communication and a corresponding polynomial reduction in required memory. This communication-memory tradeoff is achieved through minibatch-prox iterations (minibatch passive-aggressive updates), where a subproblem on a minibatch is solved at each iteration. We provide a novel analysis for such a minibatch-prox procedure which achieves the statistical optimal rate regardless of minibatch size and smoothness, thus significantly improving on prior work."}
{"text": "  In this note we answer a question of G.

{"text": "  Recommendation for e-commerce with a mix of durable and nondurable goods has characteristics that distinguish it from the well-studied media recommendation problem. The demand for items is a combined effect of form utility and time utility, i.e., a product must both be intrinsically appealing to a consumer and the time must be right for purchase. In particular for durable goods, time utility is a function of inter-purchase duration within product category because consumers are unlikely to purchase two items in the same category in close temporal succession. Moreover, purchase data, in contrast to ratings data, is implicit with non-purchases not necessarily indicating dislike. Together, these issues give rise to the positive-unlabeled demand-aware recommendation problem that we pose via joint low-rank tensor completion and product category inter-purchase duration vector estimation. We further relax this problem and propose a highly scalable alternating minimization approach with which we can solve problems with millions of users and millions of items in a single thread. We also show superior prediction accuracies on multiple real-world data sets."}
{"text": "  Identifying significant location categories visited by mobile users is the key to a variety of applications. This is an extremely challenging task due to the possible deviation between the estimated location coordinate and the actual location, which could be on the order of kilometers. To estimate the actual location category more precisely, we propose a novel tensor factorization framework, through several key observations including the intrinsic correlations between users, to infer the most likely location categories within the location uncertainty circle. In addition, the proposed algorithm can also predict where users are even in the absence of location information. In order to efficiently solve the proposed framework, we propose a parameter-free and scalable optimization algorithm by effectively exploring the sparse and low-rank structure of the tensor. Our empirical studies show that the proposed algorithm is both efficient and effective: it can solve problems with millions of users and billions of location updates, and also provides superior prediction accuracies on real-world location updates and check-in data sets."}
{"text": "  We propose a unified framework to solve general low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery problems based on matrix factorization, which covers a broad family of objective functions satisfying the restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions. Based on projected gradient descent and the double thresholding operator, our proposed generic algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unknown low-rank and sparse matrices at a locally linear rate, while matching the best-known robustness guarantee (i.e., tolerance for sparsity). At the core of our theory is a novel structural Lipschitz gradient condition for low-rank plus sparse matrices, which is essential for proving the linear convergence rate of our algorithm, and we believe is of independent interest to prove fast rates for general superposition-structured models. We illustrate the application of our framework through two concrete examples: robust matrix sensing and robust PCA. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "  Recent advances in one-shot learning have produced models that can learn from a handful of labeled examples, for passive classification and regression tasks. This paper combines reinforcement learning with one-shot learning, allowing the model to decide, during classification, which examples are worth labeling. We introduce a classification task in which a stream of images are presented and, on each time step, a decision must be made to either predict a label or pay to receive the correct label. We present a recurrent neural network based action-value function, and demonstrate its ability to learn how and when to request labels. Through the choice of reward function, the model can achieve a higher prediction accuracy than a similar model on a purely supervised task, or trade prediction accuracy for fewer label requests."}
{"text": "  Shapelets are discriminative time series subsequences that allow generation of interpretable classification models, which provide faster and generally better classification than the nearest neighbor approach. However, the shapelet discovery process requires the evaluation of all possible subsequences of all time series in the training set, making it extremely computation intensive. Consequently, shapelet discovery for large time series datasets quickly becomes intractable. A number of improvements have been proposed to reduce the training time. These techniques use approximation or discretization and often lead to reduced classification accuracy compared to the exact method.   We are proposing the use of ensembles of shapelet-based classifiers obtained using random sampling of the shapelet candidates. Using random sampling reduces the number of evaluated candidates and consequently the required computational cost, while the classification accuracy of the resulting models is also not significantly different than that of the exact algorithm. The combination of randomized classifiers rectifies the inaccuracies of individual models because of the diversity of the solutions. Based on the experiments performed, it is shown that the proposed approach of using an ensemble of inexpensive classifiers provides better classification accuracy compared to the exact method at a significantly lesser computational cost."}
{"text": "  The idea of style transfer has largely only been explored in image-based tasks, which we attribute in part to the specific nature of loss functions used for style transfer. We propose a general formulation of style transfer as an extension of generative adversarial networks, by using a discriminator to regularize a generator with an otherwise separate loss function. We apply our approach to the task of learning to play chess in the style of a specific player, and present empirical evidence for the viability of our approach."}

{"text": "  In this paper, we propose an algebraic formalization of the two important classes of dynamic programming algorithms called forward and forward-backward algorithms. They are generalized extensively in this study so that a wide range of other existing algorithms is subsumed. Forward algorithms generalized in this study subsume the ordinary forward algorithm on trellises for sequence labeling, the inside algorithm on derivation forests for CYK parsing, a unidirectional message passing on acyclic factor graphs, the forward mode of automatic differentiation on computation graphs with addition and multiplication, and so on. In addition, we reveal algebraic structures underlying complicated computation with forward algorithms. By the aid of the revealed algebraic structures, we also propose a systematic framework to design complicated variants of forward algorithms. Forward-backward algorithms generalized in this study subsume the ordinary forward-backward algorithm on trellises for sequence labeling, the inside-outside algorithm on derivation forests for CYK parsing, the sum-product algorithm on acyclic factor graphs, the reverse mode of automatic differentiation (a.k.a. back propagation) on computation graphs with addition and multiplication, and so on. We also propose an algebraic characterization of what can be computed by forward-backward algorithms and elucidate the relationship between forward and forward-backward algorithms."}
{"text": "  Deep neural nets have caused a revolution in many classification tasks. A related ongoing revolution---also theoretically not understood---concerns their ability to serve as generative models for complicated types of data such as images and texts. These models are trained using ideas like variational autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.   We take a first cut at explaining the expressivity of multilayer nets by giving a sufficient criterion for a function to be approximable by a neural network with $n$ hidden layers. A key ingredient is Barron's Theorem \\cite{Barron1993}, which gives a Fourier criterion for approximability of a function by a neural network with 1 hidden layer. We show that a composition of $n$ functions which satisfy certain Fourier conditions (\"Barron functions\") can be approximated by a $n+1$-layer neural network.   For probability distributions, this translates into a criterion for a probability distribution to be approximable in Wasserstein distance---a natural metric on probability distributions---by a neural network applied to a fixed base distribution (e.g., multivariate gaussian).   Building up recent lower bound work, we also give an example function that shows that composition of Barron functions is more expressive than Barron functions alone."}
{"text": "  Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods have been heavily exploited to analyse the association between two blocs of data. These powerful approaches can be applied to data sets where the number of variables is greater than the number of observations and in presence of high collinearity between variables. Different sparse versions of PLS have been developed to integrate multiple data sets while simultaneously selecting the contributing variables. Sparse modelling is a key factor in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between multiple data sets. The cornerstone of the sparsity version of PLS methods is the link between the SVD of a matrix (constructed from deflated versions of the original matrices of data) and least squares minimisation in linear regression. We present here an accurate description of the most popular PLS methods, alongside their mathematical proofs. A unified algorithm is proposed to perform all four types of PLS including their regularised versions. Various approaches to decrease the computation time are offered, and we show how the whole procedure can be scalable to big data sets."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose PCKID, a novel, robust, kernel function for spectral clustering, specifically designed to handle incomplete data. By combining posterior distributions of Gaussian Mixture Models for incomplete data on different scales, we are able to learn a kernel for incomplete data that does not depend on any critical hyperparameters, unlike the commonly used RBF kernel. To evaluate our method, we perform experiments on two real datasets. PCKID outperforms the baseline methods for all fractions of missing values and in some cases outperforms the baseline methods with up to 25 percentage points."}
{"text": "  Learning rates for least-squares regression are typically expressed in terms of $L_2$-norms. In this paper we extend these rates to norms stronger than the $L_2$-norm without requiring the regression function to be contained in the hypothesis space. In the special case of Sobolev reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces used as hypotheses spaces, these stronger norms coincide with fractional Sobolev norms between the used Sobolev space and $L_2$. As a consequence, not only the target function but also some of its derivatives can be estimated without changing the algorithm. From a technical point of view, we combine the well-known integral operator techniques with an embedding property, which so far has only been used in combination with empirical process arguments. This combination results in new finite sample bounds with respect to the stronger norms. From these finite sample bounds our rates easily follow. Finally, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our results in many cases."}
{"text": "  We present an approach to deep estimation of discrete conditional probability distributions. Such models have several applications, including generative modeling of audio, image, and video data. Our approach combines two main techniques: dyadic partitioning and graph-based smoothing of the discrete space. By recursively decomposing each dimension into a series of binary splits and smoothing over the resulting distribution using graph-based trend filtering, we impose a strict structure to the model and achieve much higher sample efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model through a series of benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets, in some cases reducing the error by nearly half in comparison to other popular methods in the literature. All of our models are implemented in Tensorflow and publicly available at https://github.com/tansey/sdp ."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of estimating a regression function in the common situation where the number of features is small, where interpretability of the model is a high priority, and where simple linear or additive models fail to provide adequate performance. To address this problem, we present GapTV, an approach that is conceptually related both to CART and to the more recent CRISP algorithm, a state-of-the-art alternative method for interpretable nonlinear regression. GapTV divides the feature space into blocks of constant value and fits the value of all blocks jointly via a convex optimization routine. Our method is fully data-adaptive, in that it incorporates highly robust routines for tuning all hyperparameters automatically. We compare our approach against CART and CRISP and demonstrate that GapTV finds a much better trade-off between accuracy and interpretability."}
{"text": "  The efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms depends critically on a few meta-parameters that modulates the learning updates and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The adaptation of the meta-parameters is an open question in reinforcement learning, which arguably has become more of an issue recently with the success of deep reinforcement learning in high-dimensional state spaces. The long learning times in domains such as Atari 2600 video games makes it not feasible to perform comprehensive searches of appropriate meta-parameter values. We propose the Online Meta-learning by Parallel Algorithm Competition (OMPAC) method. In the OMPAC method, several instances of a reinforcement learning algorithm are run in parallel with small differences in the initial values of the meta-parameters. After a fixed number of episodes, the instances are selected based on their performance in the task at hand. Before continuing the learning, Gaussian noise is added to the meta-parameters with a predefined probability. We validate the OMPAC method by improving the state-of-the-art results in stochastic SZ-Tetris and in standard Tetris with a smaller, 10$\\times$10, board, by 31% and 84%, respectively, and by improving the results for deep Sarsa($\\lambda$) agents in three Atari 2600 games by 62% or more. The experiments also show the ability of the OMPAC method to adapt the meta-parameters according to the learning progress in different tasks."}
{"text": "  We revisit the study of optimal regret rates in bandit combinatorial optimization---a fundamental framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty that abstracts numerous combinatorial prediction problems. We prove that the attainable regret in this setting grows as $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(k^{3/2}\\sqrt{dT})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the problem and $k$ is a bound over the maximal instantaneous loss, disproving a conjecture of Audibert, Bubeck, and Lugosi (2013) who argued that the optimal rate should be of the form $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(k\\sqrt{dT})$. Our bounds apply to several important instances of the framework, and in particular, imply a tight bound for the well-studied bandit shortest path problem. By that, we also resolve an open problem posed by Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2012)."}
{"text": "  Microwave-based breast cancer detection has been proposed as a complementary approach to compensate for some drawbacks of existing breast cancer detection techniques. Among the existing microwave breast cancer detection methods, machine learning-type algorithms have recently become more popular. These focus on detecting the existence of breast tumours rather than performing imaging to identify the exact tumour position. A key step of the machine learning approaches is feature extraction. One of the most widely used feature extraction method is principle component analysis (PCA). However, it can be sensitive to signal misalignment. This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based feature extraction method, which is more robust to the misalignment. Experimental results involving clinical data sets combined with numerically simulated tumour responses show that combined features from EMD and PCA improve the detection performance with an ensemble selection-based classifier."}
{"text": "  We consider learning a sequence classifier without labeled data by using sequential output statistics. The problem is highly valuable since obtaining labels in training data is often costly, while the sequential output statistics (e.g., language models) could be obtained independently of input data and thus with low or no cost. To address the problem, we propose an unsupervised learning cost function and study its properties. We show that, compared to earlier works, it is less inclined to be stuck in trivial solutions and avoids the need for a strong generative model. Although it is harder to optimize in its functional form, a stochastic primal-dual gradient method is developed to effectively solve the problem. Experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the new unsupervised learning method gives drastically lower errors than other baseline methods. Specifically, it reaches test errors about twice of those obtained by fully supervised learning."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of prediction with expert advice when the number of experts in question may be extremely large or even infinite. We devise an algorithm that obtains a tight regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon T + N + \\sqrt{NT})$, where $N$ is the empirical $\\epsilon$-covering number of the sequence of loss functions generated by the environment. In addition, we present a hedging procedure that allows us to find the optimal $\\epsilon$ in hindsight.   Finally, we discuss a few interesting applications of our algorithm. We show how our algorithm is applicable in the approximately low rank experts model of Hazan et al. (2016), and discuss the case of experts with bounded variation, in which there is a surprisingly large gap between the regret bounds obtained in the statistical and online settings."}
{"text": "  Variational autoencoders (VAE) often use Gaussian or category distribution to model the inference process. This puts a limit on variational learning because this simplified assumption does not match the true posterior distribution, which is usually much more sophisticated. To break this limitation and apply arbitrary parametric distribution during inference, this paper derives a \\emph{semi-continuous} latent representation, which approximates a continuous density up to a prescribed precision, and is much easier to analyze than its continuous counterpart because it is fundamentally discrete. We showcase the proposition by applying polynomial exponential family distributions as the posterior, which are universal probability density function generators. Our experimental results show consistent improvements over commonly used VAE models."}
{"text": "  We study the fundamental problem of Principal Component Analysis in a statistical distributed setting in which each machine out of $m$ stores a sample of $n$ points sampled i.i.d. from a single unknown distribution. We study algorithms for estimating the leading principal component of the population covariance matrix that are both communication-efficient and achieve estimation error of the order of the centralized ERM solution that uses all $mn$ samples. On the negative side, we show that in contrast to results obtained for distributed estimation under convexity assumptions, for the PCA objective, simply averaging the local ERM solutions cannot guarantee error that is consistent with the centralized ERM. We show that this unfortunate phenomena can be remedied by performing a simple correction step which correlates between the individual solutions, and provides an estimator that is consistent with the centralized ERM for sufficiently-large $n$. We also introduce an iterative distributed algorithm that is applicable in any regime of $n$, which is based on distributed matrix-vector products. The algorithm gives significant acceleration in terms of communication rounds over previous distributed algorithms, in a wide regime of parameters."}
{"text": "  Fixed-point optimization of deep neural networks plays an important role in hardware based design and low-power implementations. Many deep neural networks show fairly good performance even with 2- or 3-bit precision when quantized weights are fine-tuned by retraining. We propose an improved fixedpoint optimization algorithm that estimates the quantization step size dynamically during the retraining. In addition, a gradual quantization scheme is also tested, which sequentially applies fixed-point optimizations from high- to low-precision. The experiments are conducted for feed-forward deep neural networks (FFDNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)."}
{"text": "  We present a model for random simple graphs with a degree distribution that obeys a power law (i.e., is heavy-tailed). To attain this behavior, the edge probabilities in the graph are constructed from Bertoin-Fujita-Roynette-Yor (BFRY) random variables, which have been recently utilized in Bayesian statistics for the construction of power law models in several applications. Our construction readily extends to capture the structure of latent factors, similarly to stochastic blockmodels, while maintaining its power law degree distribution. The BFRY random variables are well approximated by gamma random variables in a variational Bayesian inference routine, which we apply to several network datasets for which power law degree distributions are a natural assumption. By learning the parameters of the BFRY distribution via probabilistic inference, we are able to automatically select the appropriate power law behavior from the data. In order to further scale our inference procedure, we adopt stochastic gradient ascent routines where the gradients are computed on minibatches (i.e., subsets) of the edges in the graph."}
{"text": "  A number of studies have proposed to use domain adaptation to reduce the training efforts needed to control an upper-limb prosthesis exploiting pre-trained models from prior subjects. These studies generally reported impressive reductions in the required number of training samples to achieve a certain level of accuracy for intact subjects. We further investigate two popular methods in this field to verify whether this result equally applies to amputees. Our findings show instead that this improvement can largely be attributed to a suboptimal hyperparameter configuration. When hyperparameters are appropriately tuned, the standard approach that does not exploit prior information performs on par with the more complicated transfer learning algorithms. Additionally, earlier studies erroneously assumed that the number of training samples relates proportionally to the efforts required from the subject. However, a repetition of a movement is the atomic unit for subjects and the total number of repetitions should therefore be used as reliable measure for training efforts. Also when correcting for this mistake, we do not find any performance increase due to the use of prior models."}
{"text": "  The pseudo-likelihood method is one of the most popular algorithms for learning sparse binary pairwise Markov networks. In this paper, we formulate the $L_1$ regularized pseudo-likelihood problem as a sparse multiple logistic regression problem. In this way, many insights and optimization procedures for sparse logistic regression can be applied to the learning of discrete Markov networks. Specifically, we use the coordinate descent algorithm for generalized linear models with convex penalties, combined with strong screening rules, to solve the pseudo-likelihood problem with $L_1$ regularization. Therefore a substantial speedup without losing any accuracy can be achieved. Furthermore, this method is more stable than the node-wise logistic regression approach on unbalanced high-dimensional data when penalized by small regularization parameters. Thorough numerical experiments on simulated data and real world data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  A critical component to enabling intelligent reasoning in partially observable environments is memory. Despite this importance, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have so far used relatively simple memory architectures, with the main methods to overcome partial observability being either a temporal convolution over the past k frames or an LSTM layer. More recent work (Oh et al., 2016) has went beyond these architectures by using memory networks which can allow more sophisticated addressing schemes over the past k frames. But even these architectures are unsatisfactory due to the reason that they are limited to only remembering information from the last k frames. In this paper, we develop a memory system with an adaptable write operator that is customized to the sorts of 3D environments that DRL agents typically interact with. This architecture, called the Neural Map, uses a spatially structured 2D memory image to learn to store arbitrary information about the environment over long time lags. We demonstrate empirically that the Neural Map surpasses previous DRL memories on a set of challenging 2D and 3D maze environments and show that it is capable of generalizing to environments that were not seen during training."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel kernel that models input-dependent couplings across multiple latent processes. The pairwise joint kernel measures covariance along inputs and across different latent signals in a mutually-dependent fashion. A latent correlation Gaussian process (LCGP) model combines these non-stationary latent components into multiple outputs by an input-dependent mixing matrix. Probit classification and support for multiple observation sets are derived by Variational Bayesian inference. Results on several datasets indicate that the LCGP model can recover the correlations between latent signals while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance. We highlight the latent covariances with an EEG classification dataset where latent brain processes and their couplings simultaneously emerge from the model."}
{"text": "  Training Gaussian process-based models typically involves an $ O(N^3)$ computational bottleneck due to inverting the covariance matrix. Popular methods for overcoming this matrix inversion problem cannot adequately model all types of latent functions, and are often not parallelizable. However, judicious choice of model structure can ameliorate this problem. A mixture-of-experts model that uses a mixture of $K$ Gaussian processes offers modeling flexibility and opportunities for scalable inference. Our embarrassingly parallel algorithm combines low-dimensional matrix inversions with importance sampling to yield a flexible, scalable mixture-of-experts model that offers comparable performance to Gaussian process regression at a much lower computational cost."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we discuss a different type of semi-supervised setting: a coarse level of labeling is available for all observations but the model has to learn a fine level of latent annotation for each one of them. Problems in this setting are likely to be encountered in many domains such as text categorization, protein function prediction, image classification as well as in exploratory scientific studies such as medical and genomics research. We consider this setting as simultaneously performed supervised classification (per the available coarse labels) and unsupervised clustering (within each one of the coarse labels) and propose a novel output layer modification called auto-clustering output layer (ACOL) that allows concurrent classification and clustering based on Graph-based Activity Regularization (GAR) technique. As the proposed output layer modification duplicates the softmax nodes at the output layer for each class, GAR allows for competitive learning between these duplicates on a traditional error-correction learning framework to ultimately enable a neural network to learn the latent annotations in this partially supervised setup. We demonstrate how the coarse label supervision impacts performance and helps propagate useful clustering information between sub-classes. Comparative tests on three of the most popular image datasets MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-100 rigorously demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  Nearest neighbor (kNN) methods have been gaining popularity in recent years in light of advances in hardware and efficiency of algorithms. There is a plethora of methods to choose from today, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. One requirement shared between all kNN based methods is the need for a good representation and distance measure between samples.   We introduce a new method called differentiable boundary tree which allows for learning deep kNN representations. We build on the recently proposed boundary tree algorithm which allows for efficient nearest neighbor classification, regression and retrieval. By modelling traversals in the tree as stochastic events, we are able to form a differentiable cost function which is associated with the tree's predictions. Using a deep neural network to transform the data and back-propagating through the tree allows us to learn good representations for kNN methods.   We demonstrate that our method is able to learn suitable representations allowing for very efficient trees with a clearly interpretable structure."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel method for semi-supervised learning (SSL) based on data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) using optimal transport metrics. Our proposed method enhances generalization error by using the unlabeled data to restrict the support of the worst case distribution in our DRO formulation. We enable the implementation of our DRO formulation by proposing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm which allows to easily implement the training procedure. We demonstrate that our Semi-supervised DRO method is able to improve the generalization error over natural supervised procedures and state-of-the-art SSL estimators. Finally, we include a discussion on the large sample behavior of the optimal uncertainty region in the DRO formulation. Our discussion exposes important aspects such as the role of dimension reduction in SSL."}
{"text": "  The success of semi-supervised learning crucially relies on the scalability to a huge amount of unlabelled data that are needed to capture the underlying manifold structure for better classification. Since computing the pairwise similarity between the training data is prohibitively expensive in most kinds of input data, currently, there is no general ready-to-use semi-supervised learning method/tool available for learning with tens of millions or more data points. In this paper, we adopted the idea of two low-rank label propagation algorithms, GLNP (Global Linear Neighborhood Propagation) and Kernel Nystr\\\"om Approximation, and implemented the parallelized version of the two algorithms accelerated with Nesterov's accelerated projected gradient descent for Big-data Label Propagation (BigLP).   The parallel algorithms are tested on five real datasets ranging from 7000 to 10,000,000 in size and a simulation dataset of 100,000,000 samples. In the experiments, the implementation can scale up to datasets with 100,000,000 samples and hundreds of features and the algorithms also significantly improved the prediction accuracy when only a very small percentage of the data is labeled. The results demonstrate that the BigLP implementation is highly scalable to big data and effective in utilizing the unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning."}
{"text": "  Boosting is a popular ensemble algorithm that generates more powerful learners by linearly combining base models from a simpler hypothesis class. In this work, we investigate the problem of adapting batch gradient boosting for minimizing convex loss functions to online setting where the loss at each iteration is i.i.d sampled from an unknown distribution. To generalize from batch to online, we first introduce the definition of online weak learning edge with which for strongly convex and smooth loss functions, we present an algorithm, Streaming Gradient Boosting (SGB) with exponential shrinkage guarantees in the number of weak learners. We further present an adaptation of SGB to optimize non-smooth loss functions, for which we derive a O(ln N/N) convergence rate. We also show that our analysis can extend to adversarial online learning setting under a stronger assumption that the online weak learning edge will hold in adversarial setting. We finally demonstrate experimental results showing that in practice our algorithms can achieve competitive results as classic gradient boosting while using less computation."}
{"text": "  Many current Internet services rely on inferences from models trained on user data. Commonly, both the training and inference tasks are carried out using cloud resources fed by personal data collected at scale from users. Holding and using such large collections of personal data in the cloud creates privacy risks to the data subjects, but is currently required for users to benefit from such services. We explore how to provide for model training and inference in a system where computation is pushed to the data in preference to moving data to the cloud, obviating many current privacy risks. Specifically, we take an initial model learnt from a small set of users and retrain it locally using data from a single user. We evaluate on two tasks: one supervised learning task, using a neural network to recognise users' current activity from accelerometer traces; and one unsupervised learning task, identifying topics in a large set of documents. In both cases the accuracy is improved. We also analyse the robustness of our approach against adversarial attacks, as well as its feasibility by presenting a performance evaluation on a representative resource-constrained device (a Raspberry Pi)."}
{"text": "  We consider influence maximization (IM) in social networks, which is the problem of maximizing the number of users that become aware of a product by selecting a set of \"seed\" users to expose the product to. While prior work assumes a known model of information diffusion, we propose a novel parametrization that not only makes our framework agnostic to the underlying diffusion model, but also statistically efficient to learn from data. We give a corresponding monotone, submodular surrogate function, and show that it is a good approximation to the original IM objective. We also consider the case of a new marketer looking to exploit an existing social network, while simultaneously learning the factors governing information propagation. For this, we propose a pairwise-influence semi-bandit feedback model and develop a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm. Our model-independent analysis shows that our regret bound has a better (as compared to previous work) dependence on the size of the network. Experimental evaluation suggests that our framework is robust to the underlying diffusion model and can efficiently learn a near-optimal solution."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we explore theoretical properties of training a two-layered ReLU network $g(\\mathbf{x}; \\mathbf{w}) = \\sum_{j=1}^K \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}_j^T\\mathbf{x})$ with centered $d$-dimensional spherical Gaussian input $\\mathbf{x}$ ($\\sigma$=ReLU). We train our network with gradient descent on $\\mathbf{w}$ to mimic the output of a teacher network with the same architecture and fixed parameters $\\mathbf{w}^*$. We show that its population gradient has an analytical formula, leading to interesting theoretical analysis of critical points and convergence behaviors. First, we prove that critical points outside the hyperplane spanned by the teacher parameters (\"out-of-plane\") are not isolated and form manifolds, and characterize in-plane critical-point-free regions for two ReLU case. On the other hand, convergence to $\\mathbf{w}^*$ for one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least $(1-\\epsilon)/2$ probability, if weights are initialized randomly with standard deviation upper-bounded by $O(\\epsilon/\\sqrt{d})$, consistent with empirical practice. For network with many ReLU nodes, we prove that an infinitesimal perturbation of weight initialization results in convergence towards $\\mathbf{w}^*$ (or its permutation), a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetric-breaking (SSB) in physics. We assume no independence of ReLU activations. Simulation verifies our findings."}
{"text": "  We study a fundamental class of regression models called the second order linear model (SLM). The SLM extends the linear model to high order functional space and has attracted considerable research interest recently. Yet how to efficiently learn the SLM under full generality using nonconvex solver still remains an open question due to several fundamental limitations of the conventional gradient descent learning framework. In this study, we try to attack this problem from a gradient-free approach which we call the moment-estimation-sequence (MES) method. We show that the conventional gradient descent heuristic is biased by the skewness of the distribution therefore is no longer the best practice of learning the SLM. Based on the MES framework, we design a nonconvex alternating iteration process to train a $d$-dimension rank-$k$ SLM within $O(kd)$ memory and one-pass of the dataset. The proposed method converges globally and linearly, achieves $\\epsilon$ recovery error after retrieving $O[k^{2}d\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(kd/\\epsilon)]$ samples. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals that not all SLMs can be learned on every sub-gaussian distribution. When the instances are sampled from a so-called $\\tau$-MIP distribution, the SLM can be learned by $O(p/\\tau^{2})$ samples where $p$ and $\\tau$ are positive constants depending on the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution. For non-MIP distribution, an addition diagonal-free oracle is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the learnability of the SLM. Numerical simulations verify the sharpness of our bounds on the sampling complexity and the linear convergence rate of our algorithm."}
{"text": "  We suggest analyzing neural networks through the prism of space constraints. We observe that most training algorithms applied in practice use bounded memory, which enables us to use a new notion introduced in the study of space-time tradeoffs that we call mixing complexity. This notion was devised in order to measure the (in)ability to learn using a bounded-memory algorithm. In this paper we describe how we use mixing complexity to obtain new results on what can and cannot be learned using neural networks."}
{"text": "  We consider a modification of the covariance function in Gaussian processes to correctly account for known linear constraints. By modelling the target function as a transformation of an underlying function, the constraints are explicitly incorporated in the model such that they are guaranteed to be fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. We also propose a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and illustrate the result on both simulated and real-data examples."}
{"text": "  Stochastic gradient algorithms are the main focus of large-scale optimization problems and led to important successes in the recent advancement of the deep learning algorithms. The convergence of SGD depends on the careful choice of learning rate and the amount of the noise in stochastic estimates of the gradients. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning rate algorithm, which utilizes stochastic curvature information of the loss function for automatically tuning the learning rates. The information about the element-wise curvature of the loss function is estimated from the local statistics of the stochastic first order gradients. We further propose a new variance reduction technique to speed up the convergence. In our experiments with deep neural networks, we obtained better performance compared to the popular stochastic gradient algorithms."}
{"text": "  Despite their great success, there is still no comprehensive theoretical understanding of learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their inner organization. Previous work proposed to analyze DNNs in the \\textit{Information Plane}; i.e., the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between compression and prediction, successively, for each layer.   In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\\emph compression} of the input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii) The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion, constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks. (iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers. Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly (exponentially for simple diffusion) with the information compression from the previous layer."}
{"text": "  Tracking congestion throughout the network road is a critical component of Intelligent transportation network management systems. Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes.   We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in real-time based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance, we introduce a regularized Euclidean loss function that favors high congestion samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California. Extensive experiments conducted on the designed benchmark reflect a successful congestion prediction."}
{"text": "  Researchers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in sequential decision making problems (e.g., robotics control, sequential prediction) with deep neural network models. One often has access to near-optimal oracles that achieve good performance on the task during training. We demonstrate that AggreVaTeD --- a policy gradient extension of the Imitation Learning (IL) approach of (Ross & Bagnell, 2014) --- can leverage such an oracle to achieve faster and better solutions with less training data than a less-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique. Using both feedforward and recurrent neural network predictors, we present stochastic gradient procedures on a sequential prediction task, dependency-parsing from raw image data, as well as on various high dimensional robotics control problems. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical study of IL that demonstrates we can expect up to exponentially lower sample complexity for learning with AggreVaTeD than with RL algorithms, which backs our empirical findings. Our results and theory indicate that the proposed approach can achieve superior performance with respect to the oracle when the demonstrator is sub-optimal."}
{"text": "  Computing partition function is the most important statistical inference task arising in applications of Graphical Models (GM). Since it is computationally intractable, approximate methods have been used to resolve the issue in practice, where mean-field (MF) and belief propagation (BP) are arguably the most popular and successful approaches of a variational type. In this paper, we propose two new variational schemes, coined Gauged-MF (G-MF) and Gauged-BP (G-BP), improving MF and BP, respectively. Both provide lower bounds for the partition function by utilizing the so-called gauge transformation which modifies factors of GM while keeping the partition function invariant. Moreover, we prove that both G-MF and G-BP are exact for GMs with a single loop of a special structure, even though the bare MF and BP perform badly in this case. Our extensive experiments, on complete GMs of relatively small size and on large GM (up-to 300 variables) confirm that the newly proposed algorithms outperform and generalize MF and BP."}

Dynamic time warping (DTW) aligns two sequences by nonlinear local warping and returns a distance value. DTW shows superior ability in many applications, e.g. video, image, etc. However, in DTW, two points are paired essentially based on point-to-point Euclidean distance (ED) without considering the autocorrelation of sequences. Thus, points with different semantic meanings, e.g. peaks and valleys, may be matched providing their coordinate values are similar. As a result, DTW is sensitive to noise and poorly interpretable. This paper proposes an efficient and flexible sequence alignment algorithm, dynamic state warping (DSW). DSW converts each time point into a latent state, which endows point-wise autocorrelation information. Alignment is performed by using the state sequences. Thus DSW is able to yield alignment that is semantically more interpretable than that of DTW. Using one nearest neighbor classifier, DSW shows significant improvement on classification accuracy in comparison to ED (70/85 wins) and DTW (74/85 wins). We also empirically demonstrate that DSW is more robust and scales better to long sequences than ED and DTW."}
{"text": "  In this paper we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions on the number of samples required for exact recovery of the pure-strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) set of a graphical game from noisy observations of joint actions. We consider sparse linear influence games --- a parametric class of graphical games with linear payoffs, and represented by directed graphs of n nodes (players) and in-degree of at most k. We show that one can efficiently recover the PSNE set of a linear influence game with $O(k^2 \\log n)$ samples, under very general observation models. On the other hand, we show that $\\Omega(k \\log n)$ samples are necessary for any procedure to recover the PSNE set from observations of joint actions."}
{"text": "  Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to learn complex tasks using highly general policy classes. However, sparse reward problems remain a significant challenge. Exploration methods based on novelty detection have been particularly successful in such settings but typically require generative or predictive models of the observations, which can be difficult to train when the observations are very high-dimensional and complex, as in the case of raw images. We propose a novelty detection algorithm for exploration that is based entirely on discriminatively trained exemplar models, where classifiers are trained to discriminate each visited state against all others. Intuitively, novel states are easier to distinguish against other states seen during training. We show that this kind of discriminative modeling corresponds to implicit density estimation, and that it can be combined with count-based exploration to produce competitive results on a range of popular benchmark tasks, including state-of-the-art results on challenging egocentric observations in the vizDoom benchmark."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental axioms---Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better."}
{"text": "  This paper studies a new Bayesian algorithm for the joint reconstruction and classification of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images, with application to the identification of human skin lentigo. The proposed Bayesian approach takes advantage of the distribution of the multiplicative speckle noise affecting the true reflectivity of these images and of appropriate priors for the unknown model parameters. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the model parameters and the image of true reflectivity while classifying images according to the distribution of their reflectivity. Precisely, a Metropolis-whitin-Gibbs sampler is investigated to sample the posterior distribution of the Bayesian model associated with RCM images and to build estimators of its parameters, including labels indicating the class of each RCM image. The resulting algorithm is applied to synthetic data and to real images from a clinical study containing healthy and lentigo patients."}
{"text": "  We present a new distributed representation in deep neural nets wherein the information is represented in native form as a matrix. This differs from current neural architectures that rely on vector representations. We consider matrices as central to the architecture and they compose the input, hidden and output layers. The model representation is more compact and elegant -- the number of parameters grows only with the largest dimension of the incoming layer rather than the number of hidden units. We derive several new deep networks: (i) feed-forward nets that map an input matrix into an output matrix, (ii) recurrent nets which map a sequence of input matrices into a sequence of output matrices. We also reinterpret existing models for (iii) memory-augmented networks and (iv) graphs using matrix notations. For graphs we demonstrate how the new notations lead to simple but effective extensions with multiple attentions. Extensive experiments on handwritten digits recognition, face reconstruction, sequence to sequence learning, EEG classification, and graph-based node classification demonstrate the efficacy and compactness of the matrix architectures."}
{"text": "  Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling."}
{"text": "  Yield curve forecasting is an important problem in finance. In this work we explore the use of Gaussian Processes in conjunction with a dynamic modeling strategy, much like the Kalman Filter, to model the yield curve. Gaussian Processes have been successfully applied to model functional data in a variety of applications. A Gaussian Process is used to model the yield curve. The hyper-parameters of the Gaussian Process model are updated as the algorithm receives yield curve data. Yield curve data is typically available as a time series with a frequency of one day. We compare existing methods to forecast the yield curve with the proposed method. The results of this study showed that while a competing method (a multivariate time series method) performed well in forecasting the yields at the short term structure region of the yield curve, Gaussian Processes perform well in the medium and long term structure regions of the yield curve. Accuracy in the long term structure region of the yield curve has important practical implications. The Gaussian Process framework yields uncertainty and probability estimates directly in contrast to other competing methods. Analysts are frequently interested in this information. In this study the proposed method has been applied to yield curve forecasting, however it can be applied to model high frequency time series data or data streams in other domains."}
{"text": "  We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines. Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense."}
{"text": "  We establish a data-dependent notion of algorithmic stability for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and employ it to develop novel generalization bounds. This is in contrast to previous distribution-free algorithmic stability results for SGD which depend on the worst-case constants. By virtue of the data-dependent argument, our bounds provide new insights into learning with SGD on convex and non-convex problems. In the convex case, we show that the bound on the generalization error depends on the risk at the initialization point. In the non-convex case, we prove that the expected curvature of the objective function around the initialization point has crucial influence on the generalization error. In both cases, our results suggest a simple data-driven strategy to stabilize SGD by pre-screening its initialization. As a corollary, our results allow us to show optimistic generalization bounds that exhibit fast convergence rates for SGD subject to a vanishing empirical risk and low noise of stochastic gradient."}
{"text": "  Online-learning research has mainly been focusing on minimizing one objective function. In many real-world applications, however, several objective functions have to be considered simultaneously. Recently, an algorithm for dealing with several objective functions in the i.i.d. case has been presented. In this paper, we extend the multi-objective framework to the case of stationary and ergodic processes, thus allowing dependencies among observations. We first identify an asymptomatic lower bound for any prediction strategy and then present an algorithm whose predictions achieve the optimal solution while fulfilling any continuous and convex constraining criterion."}
{"text": "  Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of achieving sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key difficulty in reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the agent to optimize. Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to overcome this problem. Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend to require that demonstrations are supplied in the first-person: the agent is provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting first-person demonstrations. Humans address this problem by learning from third-person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same task themselves.   In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation learning. Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve a simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and unsupervised refers to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states. Our methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain confusion can be utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial during the training process. To validate our approach, we report successful experiments on learning from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain, a reacher domain, and inverted pendulum."}
{"text": "  Exploration in complex domains is a key challenge in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with very sparse rewards. Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as $\\epsilon$-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, but there are many tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the $k$-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed in a wide range of environments with high-dimensional state spaces and very sparse rewards, including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques."}
{"text": "  We study two procedures (reverse-mode and forward-mode) for computing the gradient of the validation error with respect to the hyperparameters of any iterative learning algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent. These procedures mirror two methods of computing gradients for recurrent neural networks and have different trade-offs in terms of running time and space requirements. Our formulation of the reverse-mode procedure is linked to previous work by Maclaurin et al. [2015] but does not require reversible dynamics. The forward-mode procedure is suitable for real-time hyperparameter updates, which may significantly speed up hyperparameter optimization on large datasets. We present experiments on data cleaning and on learning task interactions. We also present one large-scale experiment where the use of previous gradient-based methods would be prohibitive."}
{"text": "  Inspired by the importance of diversity in biological system, we built an heterogeneous system that could achieve this goal. Our architecture could be summarized in two basic steps. First, we generate a diverse set of classification hypothesis using both Convolutional Neural Networks, currently the state-of-the-art technique for this task, among with other traditional and innovative machine learning techniques. Then, we optimally combine them through Meta-Nets, a family of recently developed and performing ensemble methods."}
{"text": "  Deep generative models have been wildly successful at learning coherent latent representations for continuous data such as video and audio. However, generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions and molecular structures still poses significant challenges. Crucially, state-of-the-art methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which encodes and decodes directly to and from these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always valid. Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs, it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and molecular synthesis."}
{"text": "  We discuss a Bayesian formulation to coarse-graining (CG) of PDEs where the coefficients (e.g. material parameters) exhibit random, fine scale variability. The direct solution to such problems requires grids that are small enough to resolve this fine scale variability which unavoidably requires the repeated solution of very large systems of algebraic equations. We establish a physically inspired, data-driven coarse-grained model which learns a low- dimensional set of microstructural features that are predictive of the fine-grained model (FG) response. Once learned, those features provide a sharp distribution over the coarse scale effec- tive coefficients of the PDE that are most suitable for prediction of the fine scale model output. This ultimately allows to replace the computationally expensive FG by a generative proba- bilistic model based on evaluating the much cheaper CG several times. Sparsity enforcing pri- ors further increase predictive efficiency and reveal microstructural features that are important in predicting the FG response. Moreover, the model yields probabilistic rather than single-point predictions, which enables the quantification of the unavoidable epistemic uncertainty that is present due to the information loss that occurs during the coarse-graining process."}
{"text": "  A new line of work [Dwork et al. STOC 2015], [Hardt and Ullman FOCS 2014], [Steinke and Ullman COLT 2015], [Bassily et al. STOC 2016] demonstrates how differential privacy [Dwork et al. TCC 2006] can be used as a mathematical tool for guaranteeing generalization in adaptive data analysis. Specifically, if a differentially private analysis is applied on a sample S of i.i.d. examples to select a low-sensitivity function f, then w.h.p. f(S) is close to its expectation, although f is being chosen based on the data.   Very recently, Steinke and Ullman observed that these generalization guarantees can be used for proving concentration bounds in the non-adaptive setting, where the low-sensitivity function is fixed beforehand. In particular, they obtain alternative proofs for classical concentration bounds for low-sensitivity functions, such as the Chernoff bound and McDiarmid's Inequality.   In this work, we set out to examine the situation for functions with high-sensitivity, for which differential privacy does not imply generalization guarantees under adaptive analysis. We show that differential privacy can be used to prove concentration bounds for such functions in the non-adaptive setting."}
{"text": "  Metabolomic data can potentially enable accurate, non-invasive and low-cost prediction of coronary artery disease. Regression-based analytical approaches however might fail to fully account for interactions between metabolites, rely on a priori selected input features and thus might suffer from poorer accuracy. Supervised machine learning methods can potentially be used in order to fully exploit the dimensionality and richness of the data. In this paper, we systematically implement and evaluate a set of supervised learning methods (L1 regression, random forest classifier) and compare them to traditional regression-based approaches for disease prediction using metabolomic data."}
{"text": "  Motifs are a powerful tool for analyzing physiological waveform data. Standard motif methods, however, ignore important contextual information (e.g., what the patient was doing at the time the data were collected). We hypothesize that these additional contextual data could increase the utility of motifs. Thus, we propose an extension to motifs, contextual motifs, that incorporates context. Recognizing that, oftentimes, context may be unobserved or unavailable, we focus on methods to jointly infer motifs and context. Applied to both simulated and real physiological data, our proposed approach improves upon existing motif methods in terms of the discriminative utility of the discovered motifs. In particular, we discovered contextual motifs in continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data collected from patients with type 1 diabetes. Compared to their contextless counterparts, these contextual motifs led to better predictions of hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Our results suggest that even when inferred, context is useful in both a long- and short-term prediction horizon when processing and interpreting physiological waveform data."}
{"text": "  Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms predict labels for all nodes based on provided labels of a small set of seed nodes. Classic methods capture the graph structure through some underlying diffusion process that propagates through the graph edges. Spectral diffusion, which includes personalized page rank and label propagation, propagates through random walks. Social diffusion propagates through shortest paths. A common ground to these diffusions is their {\\em linearity}, which does not distinguish between contributions of few \"strong\" relations and many \"weak\" relations.   Recently, non-linear methods such as node embeddings and graph convolutional networks (GCN) demonstrated a large gain in quality for SSL tasks. These methods introduce multiple components and greatly vary on how the graph structure, seed label information, and other features are used.   We aim here to study the contribution of non-linearity, as an isolated ingredient, to the performance gain. To do so, we place classic linear graph diffusions in a self-training framework. Surprisingly, we observe that SSL using the resulting {\\em bootstrapped diffusions} not only significantly improves over the respective non-bootstrapped baselines but also outperform state-of-the-art non-linear SSL methods. Moreover, since the self-training wrapper retains the scalability of the base method, we obtain both higher quality and better scalability."}
{"text": "  The gang of bandits (GOB) model \\cite{cesa2013gang} is a recent contextual bandits framework that shares information between a set of bandit problems, related by a known (possibly noisy) graph. This model is useful in problems like recommender systems where the large number of users makes it vital to transfer information between users. Despite its effectiveness, the existing GOB model can only be applied to small problems due to its quadratic time-dependence on the number of nodes. Existing solutions to combat the scalability issue require an often-unrealistic clustering assumption. By exploiting a connection to Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), we show that the GOB model can be made to scale to much larger graphs without additional assumptions. In addition, we propose a Thompson sampling algorithm which uses the recent GMRF sampling-by-perturbation technique, allowing it to scale to even larger problems (leading to a \"horde\" of bandits). We give regret bounds and experimental results for GOB with Thompson sampling and epoch-greedy algorithms, indicating that these methods are as good as or significantly better than ignoring the graph or adopting a clustering-based approach. Finally, when an existing graph is not available, we propose a heuristic for learning it on the fly and show promising results."}
{"text": "  The goal of the paper is to design sequential strategies which lead to efficient optimization of an unknown function under the only assumption that it has a finite Lipschitz constant. We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H\\\"older like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization."}
{"text": "  We study dual volume sampling, a method for selecting k columns from an n x m short and wide matrix (n <= k <= m) such that the probability of selection is proportional to the volume spanned by the rows of the induced submatrix. This method was proposed by Avron and Boutsidis (2013), who showed it to be a promising method for column subset selection and its multiple applications. However, its wider adoption has been hampered by the lack of polynomial time sampling algorithms. We remove this hindrance by developing an exact (randomized) polynomial time sampling algorithm as well as its derandomization. Thereafter, we study dual volume sampling via the theory of real stable polynomials and prove that its distribution satisfies the \"Strong Rayleigh\" property. This result has numerous consequences, including a provably fast-mixing Markov chain sampler that makes dual volume sampling much more attractive to practitioners. This sampler is closely related to classical algorithms for popular experimental design methods that are to date lacking theoretical analysis but are known to empirically work well."}
{"text": "  We consider the statistical problem of recovering a hidden \"ground truth\" binary labeling for the vertices of a graph up to low Hamming error from noisy edge and vertex measurements. We present new algorithms and a sharp finite-sample analysis for this problem on trees and sparse graphs with poor expansion properties such as hypergrids and ring lattices. Our method generalizes and improves over that of Globerson et al. (2015), who introduced the problem for two-dimensional grid lattices.   For trees we provide a simple, efficient, algorithm that infers the ground truth with optimal Hamming error has optimal sample complexity and implies recovery results for all connected graphs. Here, the presence of side information is critical to obtain a non-trivial recovery rate. We then show how to adapt this algorithm to tree decompositions of edge-subgraphs of certain graph families such as lattices, resulting in optimal recovery error rates that can be obtained efficiently   The thrust of our analysis is to 1) use the tree decomposition along with edge measurements to produce a small class of viable vertex labelings and 2) apply an analysis influenced by statistical learning theory to show that we can infer the ground truth from this class using vertex measurements. We show the power of our method in several examples including hypergrids, ring lattices, and the Newman-Watts model for small world graphs. For two-dimensional grids, our results improve over Globerson et al. (2015) by obtaining optimal recovery in the constant-height regime."}
{"text": "  We prove new upper and lower bounds on the VC-dimension of deep neural networks with the ReLU activation function. These bounds are tight for almost the entire range of parameters. Letting $W$ be the number of weights and $L$ be the number of layers, we prove that the VC-dimension is $O(W L \\log(W))$, and provide examples with VC-dimension $\\Omega( W L \\log(W/L) )$. This improves both the previously known upper bounds and lower bounds. In terms of the number $U$ of non-linear units, we prove a tight bound $\\Theta(W U)$ on the VC-dimension. All of these bounds generalize to arbitrary piecewise linear activation functions, and also hold for the pseudodimensions of these function classes.   Combined with previous results, this gives an intriguing range of dependencies of the VC-dimension on depth for networks with different non-linearities: there is no dependence for piecewise-constant, linear dependence for piecewise-linear, and no more than quadratic dependence for general piecewise-polynomial."}
{"text": "  Although many machine learning algorithms involve learning subspaces with particular characteristics, optimizing a parameter matrix that is constrained to represent a subspace can be challenging. One solution is to use Riemannian optimization methods that enforce such constraints implicitly, leveraging the fact that the feasible parameter values form a manifold. While Riemannian methods exist for some specific problems, such as learning a single subspace, there are more general subspace constraints that offer additional flexibility when setting up an optimization problem, but have not been formulated as a manifold.   We propose the partitioned subspace (PS) manifold for optimizing matrices that are constrained to represent one or more subspaces. Each point on the manifold defines a partitioning of the input space into mutually orthogonal subspaces, where the number of partitions and their sizes are defined by the user. As a result, distinct groups of features can be learned by defining different objective functions for each partition. We illustrate the properties of the manifold through experiments on multiple dataset analysis and domain adaptation."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of imitation learning from demonstrations of multiple coordinating agents. One key challenge in this setting is that learning a good model of coordination can be difficult, since coordination is often implicit in the demonstrations and must be inferred as a latent variable. We propose a joint approach that simultaneously learns a latent coordination model along with the individual policies. In particular, our method integrates unsupervised structure learning with conventional imitation learning. We illustrate the power of our approach on a difficult problem of learning multiple policies for fine-grained behavior modeling in team sports, where different players occupy different roles in the coordinated team strategy. We show that having a coordination model to infer the roles of players yields substantially improved imitation loss compared to conventional baselines."}
{"text": "  Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural networks are still limited when it comes to life-long and one-shot learning, especially in remembering rare events. We present a large-scale life-long memory module for use in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end with no extra supervision. It operates in a life-long manner, i.e., without the need to reset it during training.   Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network. To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple convolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence and recurrent-convolutional models. In all cases, the enhanced network gains the ability to remember and do life-long one-shot learning. Our module remembers training examples shown many thousands of steps in the past and it can successfully generalize from them. We set new state-of-the-art for one-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset and demonstrate, for the first time, life-long one-shot learning in recurrent neural networks on a large-scale machine translation task."}
{"text": "  Density ratio estimation is a vital tool in both machine learning and statistical community. However, due to the unbounded nature of density ratio, the estimation procedure can be vulnerable to corrupted data points, which often pushes the estimated ratio toward infinity. In this paper, we present a robust estimator which automatically identifies and trims outliers. The proposed estimator has a convex formulation, and the global optimum can be obtained via subgradient descent. We analyze the parameter estimation error of this estimator under high-dimensional settings. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the estimator."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we suggest a novel data-driven approach to active learning (AL). The key idea is to train a regressor that predicts the expected error reduction for a candidate sample in a particular learning state. By formulating the query selection procedure as a regression problem we are not restricted to working with existing AL heuristics; instead, we learn strategies based on experience from previous AL outcomes. We show that a strategy can be learnt either from simple synthetic 2D datasets or from a subset of domain-specific data. Our method yields strategies that work well on real data from a wide range of domains."}
{"text": "  We present mlrMBO, a flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization (MBO), also known as Bayesian optimization, which addresses the problem of expensive black-box optimization by approximating the given objective function through a surrogate regression model. It is designed for both single- and multi-objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and conditional parameters. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal, parallelization, visualization, logging and error-handling. mlrMBO is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases, e.g., any regression learner from the mlr toolbox for machine learning can be used, and infill criteria and infill optimizers are easily exchangeable. We empirically demonstrate that mlrMBO provides state-of-the-art performance by comparing it on different benchmark scenarios against a wide range of other optimizers, including DiceOptim, rBayesianOptimization, SPOT, SMAC, Spearmint, and Hyperopt."}
{"text": "  Indian Buffet Process based models are an elegant way for discovering underlying features within a data set, but inference in such models can be slow. Inferring underlying features using Markov chain Monte Carlo either relies on an uncollapsed representation, which leads to poor mixing, or on a collapsed representation, which leads to a quadratic increase in computational complexity. Existing attempts at distributing inference have introduced additional approximation within the inference procedure. In this paper we present a novel algorithm to perform asymptotically exact parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo inference for Indian Buffet Process models. We take advantage of the fact that the features are conditionally independent under the beta-Bernoulli process. Because of this conditional independence, we can partition the features into two parts: one part containing only the finitely many instantiated features and the other part containing the infinite tail of uninstantiated features. For the finite partition, parallel inference is simple given the instantiation of features. But for the infinite tail, performing uncollapsed MCMC leads to poor mixing and hence we collapse out the features. The resulting hybrid sampler, while being parallel, produces samples asymptotically from the true posterior."}
{"text": "  We prove that a particular deep network architecture is more efficient at approximating radially symmetric functions than the best known 2 or 3 layer networks. We use this architecture to approximate Gaussian kernel SVMs, and subsequently improve upon them with further training. The architecture and initial weights of the Deep Radial Kernel Network are completely specified by the SVM and therefore sidesteps the problem of empirically choosing an appropriate deep network architecture."}
{"text": "  We present an extensive study of the key problem of online learning where algorithms are allowed to abstain from making predictions. In the adversarial setting, we show how existing online algorithms and guarantees can be adapted to this problem. In the stochastic setting, we first point out a bias problem that limits the straightforward extension of algorithms such as UCB-N to time-varying feedback graphs, as needed in this context. Next, we give a new algorithm, UCB-GT, that exploits historical data and is adapted to time-varying feedback graphs. We show that this algorithm benefits from more favorable regret guarantees than a possible, but limited, extension of UCB-N. We further report the results of a series of experiments demonstrating that UCB-GT largely outperforms that extension of UCB-N, as well as more standard baselines."}
{"text": "  We show that DBSCAN can estimate the connected components of the $\\lambda$-density level set $\\{ x : f(x) \\ge \\lambda\\}$ given $n$ i.i.d. samples from an unknown density $f$. We characterize the regularity of the level set boundaries using parameter $\\beta > 0$ and analyze the estimation error under the Hausdorff metric. When the data lies in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ we obtain a rate of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\\beta + D)})$, which matches known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. When the data lies on an embedded unknown $d$-dimensional manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, then we obtain a rate of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\\beta + d\\cdot \\max\\{1, \\beta \\})})$. Finally, we provide adaptive parameter tuning in order to attain these rates with no a priori knowledge of the intrinsic dimension, density, or $\\beta$."}
{"text": "  The present study proposes a deep learning model, named DeepSleepNet, for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw single-channel EEG. Most of the existing methods rely on hand-engineered features which require prior knowledge of sleep analysis. Only a few of them encode the temporal information such as transition rules, which is important for identifying the next sleep stages, into the extracted features. In the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to extract time-invariant features, and bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory to learn transition rules among sleep stages automatically from EEG epochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm to train our model efficiently. We evaluated our model using different single-channel EEGs (F4-EOG(Left), Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) from two public sleep datasets, that have different properties (e.g., sampling rate) and scoring standards (AASM and R&K). The results showed that our model achieved similar overall accuracy and macro F1-score (MASS: 86.2%-81.7, Sleep-EDF: 82.0%-76.9) compared to the state-of-the-art methods (MASS: 85.9%-80.5, Sleep-EDF: 78.9%-73.7) on both datasets. This demonstrated that, without changing the model architecture and the training algorithm, our model could automatically learn features for sleep stage scoring from different raw single-channel EEGs from different datasets without utilizing any hand-engineered features."}

The model is inspired by standard autoregressive (AR) models and gating mechanisms used in recurrent neural networks. It involves an AR-like weighting system, where the final predictor is obtained as a weighted sum of adjusted regressors, while the weights are datadependent functions learnt through a convolutional network. The architecture was designed for applications on asynchronous time series and is evaluated on such datasets: a hedge fund proprietary dataset of over 2 million quotes for a credit derivative index, an artificially generated noisy autoregressive series and UCI household electricity consumption dataset. The proposed architecture achieves promising results as compared to convolutional and recurrent neural networks."}
{"text": "  Today, detection of anomalous events in civil infrastructures (e.g. water pipe breaks and leaks) is time consuming and often takes hours or days. Pipe breakage as one of the most frequent types of failure of water networks often causes community disruptions ranging from temporary interruptions in services to extended loss of business and relocation of residents. In this project, we design and implement a two-phase approach for leak event identification, which leverages dynamic data from multiple information sources including IoT sensing data (pressure values and/or flow rates), geophysical data (water systems), and human inputs (tweets posted on Twitter). In the approach, a high order Conditional Random Field (CRF) is constructed that enforces predictions based on IoT observations consistent with human inputs to improve the performance of event identifications.   Considering the physical water network as a graph, a CRF model is built and learned by the Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM) using node features such as water pressure and flow rate. After that, we built the high order CRF system by enforcing twitter leakage detection information. An optimal inference algorithm is proposed for the adapted high order CRF model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our system."}
{"text": "  Variational inference is computationally challenging in models that contain both conjugate and non-conjugate terms. Methods specifically designed for conjugate models, even though computationally efficient, find it difficult to deal with non-conjugate terms. On the other hand, stochastic-gradient methods can handle the non-conjugate terms but they usually ignore the conjugate structure of the model which might result in slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation Variational Inference (CVI) which brings the best of the two worlds together -- it uses conjugate computations for the conjugate terms and employs stochastic gradients for the rest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method in the mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a variational inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm's applicability to a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our experimental results show that our method converges much faster than the methods that ignore the conjugate structure of the model."}
{"text": "  We propose an Online Learning with Local Permutations (OLLP) setting, in which the learner is allowed to slightly permute the \\emph{order} of the loss functions generated by an adversary. On one hand, this models natural situations where the exact order of the learner's responses is not crucial, and on the other hand, might allow better learning and regret performance, by mitigating highly adversarial loss sequences. Also, with random permutations, this can be seen as a setting interpolating between adversarial and stochastic losses. In this paper, we consider the applicability of this setting to convex online learning with delayed feedback, in which the feedback on the prediction made in round $t$ arrives with some delay $\\tau$. With such delayed feedback, the best possible regret bound is well-known to be $O(\\sqrt{\\tau T})$. We prove that by being able to permute losses by a distance of at most $M$ (for $M\\geq \\tau$), the regret can be improved to $O(\\sqrt{T}(1+\\sqrt{\\tau^2/M}))$, using a Mirror-Descent based algorithm which can be applied for both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries. We also prove a lower bound, showing that for $M<\\tau/3$, it is impossible to improve the standard $O(\\sqrt{\\tau T})$ regret bound by more than constant factors. Finally, we provide some experiments validating the performance of our algorithm."}
{"text": "  Advances in Machine Learning (ML) have led to its adoption as an integral component in many applications, including banking, medical diagnosis, and driverless cars. To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services offered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service tools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the classifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that adversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another classifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different architectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is known as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box systems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and transferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to protect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block their transferability. To this end, we propose a training method that, as the input is more perturbed, the classifier smoothly outputs lower confidence on the original label and instead predicts that the input is \"invalid\". In essence, we augment the output class set with a NULL label and train the classifier to reject the adversarial examples by classifying them as NULL. In experiments, we apply a wide range of attacks based on adversarial examples on the black-box systems. We show that a classifier trained with the proposed method effectively resists against the adversarial examples, while maintaining the accuracy on clean data."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel Bayesian Optimization approach for black-box functions with an environmental variable whose value determines the tradeoff between evaluation cost and the fidelity of the evaluations. Further, we use a novel approach to sampling support points, allowing faster construction of the acquisition function. This allows us to achieve optimization with lower overheads than previous approaches and is implemented for a more general class of problem. We show this approach to be effective on synthetic and real world benchmark problems."}
{"text": "  Gaussian process model for vector-valued function has been shown to be useful for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to re-formulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, re-formulation is not always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student$-t$ distribution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce a novel multivariate Student$-t$ process regression model (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and real data examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets."}
{"text": "  We present a method for conditional time series forecasting based on an adaptation of the recent deep convolutional WaveNet architecture. The proposed network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad range of history when forecasting, a ReLU activation function and conditioning is performed by applying multiple convolutional filters in parallel to separate time series which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. We test and analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally as well as conditionally for financial time series forecasting using the S&P500, the volatility index, the CBOE interest rate and several exchange rates and extensively compare it to the performance of the well-known autoregressive model and a long-short term memory network. We show that a convolutional network is well-suited for regression-type problems and is able to effectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long historical time series, is a time-efficient and easy to implement alternative to recurrent-type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models."}
{"text": "  We propose a probabilistic model to aggregate the answers of respondents answering multiple-choice questions. The model does not assume that everyone has access to the same information, and so does not assume that the consensus answer is correct. Instead, it infers the most probable world state, even if only a minority vote for it. Each respondent is modeled as receiving a signal contingent on the actual world state, and as using this signal to both determine their own answer and predict the answers given by others. By incorporating respondent's predictions of others' answers, the model infers latent parameters corresponding to the prior over world states and the probability of different signals being received in all possible world states, including counterfactual ones. Unlike other probabilistic models for aggregation, our model applies to both single and multiple questions, in which case it estimates each respondent's expertise. The model shows good performance, compared to a number of other probabilistic models, on data from seven studies covering different types of expertise."}
{"text": "  The goal of data clustering is to partition data points into groups to minimize a given objective function. While most existing clustering algorithms treat each data point as vector, in many applications each datum is not a vector but a point pattern or a set of points. Moreover, many existing clustering methods require the user to specify the number of clusters, which is not available in advance. This paper proposes a new class of models for data clustering that addresses set-valued data as well as unknown number of clusters, using a Dirichlet Process mixture of Poisson random finite sets. We also develop an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior inference technique that can learn the number of clusters and mixture parameters automatically from the data. Numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the salient features of this new model, in particular its capacity to discover extremely unbalanced clusters in data."}
{"text": "  Parameter settings profoundly impact the performance of machine learning algorithms and laboratory experiments. The classical grid search or trial-error methods are exponentially expensive in large parameter spaces, and Bayesian optimization (BO) offers an elegant alternative for global optimization of black box functions. In situations where the black box function can be evaluated at multiple points simultaneously, batch Bayesian optimization is used. Current batch BO approaches are restrictive in that they fix the number of evaluations per batch, and this can be wasteful when the number of specified evaluations is larger than the number of real maxima in the underlying acquisition function. We present the Budgeted Batch Bayesian Optimization (B3O) for hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design - we identify the appropriate batch size for each iteration in an elegant way. To set the batch size flexible, we use the infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) for automatically identifying the number of peaks in the underlying acquisition functions. We solve the intractability of estimating the IGMM directly from the acquisition function by formulating the batch generalized slice sampling to efficiently draw samples from the acquisition function. We perform extensive experiments for both synthetic functions and two real world applications - machine learning hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design for alloy hardening. We show empirically that the proposed B3O outperforms the existing fixed batch BO approaches in finding the optimum whilst requiring a fewer number of evaluations, thus saving cost and time."}
{"text": "  We propose a data aggregation-based algorithm with monotonic convergence to a global optimum for a generalized version of the L1-norm error fitting model with an assumption of the fitting function. The proposed algorithm generalizes the recent algorithm in the literature, aggregate and iterative disaggregate (AID), which selectively solves three specific L1-norm error fitting problems. With the proposed algorithm, any L1-norm error fitting model can be solved optimally if it follows the form of the L1-norm error fitting problem and if the fitting function satisfies the assumption. The proposed algorithm can also solve multi-dimensional fitting problems with arbitrary constraints on the fitting coefficients matrix. The generalized problem includes popular models such as regression and the orthogonal Procrustes problem. The results of the computational experiment show that the proposed algorithms are faster than the state-of-the-art benchmarks for L1-norm regression subset selection and L1-norm regression over a sphere. Further, the relative performance of the proposed algorithm improves as data size increases."}
{"text": "  Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep learning architectures tend to generalize relatively well to unseen data, allowing them to be deployed in practice. However, explaining why this is the case is still an open area of research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g. Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al. (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization. Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Furthermore, if we allow to reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically without affecting its generalization properties."}
{"text": "  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have demonstrated superior ability to extract high level embedding vectors from low level features. Despite the success, the serving time is still the bottleneck due to expensive run-time computation of multiple layers of dense matrices. GPGPU, FPGA, or ASIC-based serving systems require additional hardware that are not in the mainstream design of most commercial applications. In contrast, tree or forest-based models are widely adopted because of low serving cost, but heavily depend on carefully engineered features. This work proposes a Deep Embedding Forest model that benefits from the best of both worlds. The model consists of a number of embedding layers and a forest/tree layer. The former maps high dimensional (hundreds of thousands to millions) and heterogeneous low-level features to the lower dimensional (thousands) vectors, and the latter ensures fast serving.   Built on top of a representative DNN model called Deep Crossing, and two forest/tree-based models including XGBoost and LightGBM, a two-step Deep Embedding Forest algorithm is demonstrated to achieve on-par or slightly better performance as compared with the DNN counterpart, with only a fraction of serving time on conventional hardware. After comparing with a joint optimization algorithm called partial fuzzification, also proposed in this paper, it is concluded that the two-step Deep Embedding Forest has achieved near optimal performance. Experiments based on large scale data sets (up to 1 billion samples) from a major sponsored search engine proves the efficacy of the proposed model."}
{"text": "  We describe a simple scheme that allows an agent to learn about its environment in an unsupervised manner. Our scheme pits two versions of the same agent, Alice and Bob, against one another. Alice proposes a task for Bob to complete; and then Bob attempts to complete the task. In this work we will focus on two kinds of environments: (nearly) reversible environments and environments that can be reset. Alice will \"propose\" the task by doing a sequence of actions and then Bob must undo or repeat them, respectively. Via an appropriate reward structure, Alice and Bob automatically generate a curriculum of exploration, enabling unsupervised training of the agent. When Bob is deployed on an RL task within the environment, this unsupervised training reduces the number of supervised episodes needed to learn, and in some cases converges to a higher reward."}
{"text": "  This work addresses various open questions in the theory of active learning for nonparametric classification. Our contributions are both statistical and algorithmic: -We establish new minimax-rates for active learning under common \\textit{noise conditions}. These rates display interesting transitions -- due to the interaction between noise \\textit{smoothness and margin} -- not present in the passive setting. Some such transitions were previously conjectured, but remained unconfirmed. -We present a generic algorithmic strategy for adaptivity to unknown noise smoothness and margin; our strategy achieves optimal rates in many general situations; furthermore, unlike in previous work, we avoid the need for \\textit{adaptive confidence sets}, resulting in strictly milder distributional requirements."}
{"text": "  Graph-based semi-supervised learning is one of the most popular methods in machine learning. Some of its theoretical properties such as bounds for the generalization error and the convergence of the graph Laplacian regularizer have been studied in computer science and statistics literatures. However, a fundamental statistical property, the consistency of the estimator from this method has not been proved. In this article, we study the consistency problem under a non-parametric framework. We prove the consistency of graph-based learning in the case that the estimated scores are enforced to be equal to the observed responses for the labeled data. The sample sizes of both labeled and unlabeled data are allowed to grow in this result. When the estimated scores are not required to be equal to the observed responses, a tuning parameter is used to balance the loss function and the graph Laplacian regularizer. We give a counterexample demonstrating that the estimator for this case can be inconsistent. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies."}
{"text": "  Bandit methods for black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation, are used in a variety of applications including hyper-parameter tuning and experiment design. Recently, \\emph{multi-fidelity} methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. In many practical applications however, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space $(N,T)$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments."}
{"text": "  The goal in semi-supervised learning is to effectively combine labeled and unlabeled data. One way to do this is by encouraging smoothness across edges in a graph whose nodes correspond to input examples. In many graph-based methods, labels can be thought of as propagating over the graph, where the underlying propagation mechanism is based on random walks or on averaging dynamics. While theoretically elegant, these dynamics suffer from several drawbacks which can hurt predictive performance.   Our goal in this work is to explore alternative mechanisms for propagating labels. In particular, we propose a method based on dynamic infection processes, where unlabeled nodes can be \"infected\" with the label of their already infected neighbors. Our algorithm is efficient and scalable, and an analysis of the underlying optimization objective reveals a surprising relation to other Laplacian approaches. We conclude with a thorough set of experiments across multiple benchmarks and various learning settings."}

We provide an overview over the state-of-the-art in coreset construction for machine learning. In Section 2, we present both the intuition behind and a theoretically sound framework to construct coresets for general problems and apply it to $k$-means clustering. In Section 3 we summarize existing coreset construction algorithms for a variety of machine learning problems such as maximum likelihood estimation of mixture models, Bayesian non-parametric models, principal component analysis, regression and general empirical risk minimization."}
{"text": "  Many applications require solving non-linear control problems that are classically not well behaved. This paper develops a simple and efficient chattering algorithm that learns near optimal decision policies through an open-loop feedback strategy. The optimal control problem reduces to a series of linear optimization programs that can be easily solved to recover a relaxed optimal trajectory. This algorithm is implemented on a real-time enterprise scheduling and control process."}
{"text": "  We propose a new method for training iterative collective classifiers for labeling nodes in network data. The iterative classification algorithm (ICA) is a canonical method for incorporating relational information into classification. Yet, existing methods for training ICA models rely on the assumption that relational features reflect the true labels of the nodes. This unrealistic assumption introduces a bias that is inconsistent with the actual prediction algorithm. In this paper, we introduce recurrent collective classification (RCC), a variant of ICA analogous to recurrent neural network prediction. RCC accommodates any differentiable local classifier and relational feature functions. We provide gradient-based strategies for optimizing over model parameters to more directly minimize the loss function. In our experiments, this direct loss minimization translates to improved accuracy and robustness on real network data. We demonstrate the robustness of RCC in settings where local classification is very noisy, settings that are particularly challenging for ICA."}
{"text": "  The massive amount of available data potentially used to discover patters in machine learning is a challenge for kernel based algorithms with respect to runtime and storage capacities. Local approaches might help to relieve these issues. From a statistical point of view local approaches allow additionally to deal with different structures in the data in different ways. This paper analyses properties of localized kernel based, non-parametric statistical machine learning methods, in particular of support vector machines (SVMs) and methods close to them. We will show there that locally learnt kernel methods are universal consistent. Furthermore, we give an upper bound for the maxbias in order to show statistical robustness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "  A selective classifier (f,g) comprises a classification function f and a binary selection function g, which determines if the classifier abstains from prediction, or uses f to predict. The classifier is called pointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best classifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain. The quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined to be the probability mass of the points it rejects. A \"fast\" rejection rate is achieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by O(1/m) where m is the number of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and O hides logarithmic factors). Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are intimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that in the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called Consistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the well-known CAL active algorithm.   We focus on the agnostic setting, for which there is a known algorithm called LESS that learns a PCS classifier and achieves a fast rejection rate (depending on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) under strong assumptions. We present an improved PCS learning algorithm called ILESS for which we show a fast rate (depending on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) without any assumptions. Our rejection bound smoothly interpolates the realizable and agnostic settings. The main result of this paper is an equivalence between the following three entities: (i) the existence of a fast rejection rate for any PCS learning algorithm (such as ILESS); (ii) a poly-logarithmic bound for Hanneke's disagreement coefficient; and (iii) an exponential speedup for a new disagreement-based active learner called ActiveiLESS."}
{"text": "  As an emerging research topic, online class imbalance learning often combines the challenges of both class imbalance and concept drift. It deals with data streams having very skewed class distributions, where concept drift may occur. It has recently received increased research attention; however, very little work addresses the combined problem where both class imbalance and concept drift coexist. As the first systematic study of handling concept drift in class-imbalanced data streams, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of current research progress in this field, including current research focuses and open challenges. Then, an in-depth experimental study is performed, with the goal of understanding how to best overcome concept drift in online learning with class imbalance. Based on the analysis, a general guideline is proposed for the development of an effective algorithm."}
{"text": "  In machine learning and neuroscience, certain computational structures and algorithms are known to yield disentangled representations without us understanding why, the most striking examples being perhaps convolutional neural networks and the ventral stream of the visual cortex in humans and primates. As for the latter, it was conjectured that representations may be disentangled by being flattened progressively and at a local scale. An attempt at a formalization of the role of invariance in learning representations was made recently, being referred to as I-theory. In this framework and using the language of differential geometry, we show that pooling over a group of transformations of the input contracts the metric and reduces its curvature, and provide quantitative bounds, in the aim of moving towards a theoretical understanding on how to disentangle representations."}
{"text": "  In this work, we utilize a Trust Region based Derivative Free Optimization (DFO-TR) method to directly maximize the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which is a nonsmooth, noisy function. We show that AUC is a smooth function, in expectation, if the distributions of the positive and negative data points obey a jointly normal distribution. The practical performance of this algorithm is compared to three prominent Bayesian optimization methods and random search. The presented numerical results show that DFO-TR surpasses Bayesian optimization and random search on various black-box optimization problem, such as maximizing AUC and hyperparameter tuning."}

We evaluate our methods on around 35,500 patients from the latest MIMIC III dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital."}
{"text": "  Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are available online."}
{"text": "  Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a single line text representation of a unique molecule. One molecule can however have multiple SMILES strings, which is a reason that canonical SMILES have been defined, which ensures a one to one correspondence between SMILES string and molecule. Here the fact that multiple SMILES represent the same molecule is explored as a technique for data augmentation of a molecular QSAR dataset modeled by a long short term memory (LSTM) cell based neural network. The augmented dataset was 130 times bigger than the original. The network trained with the augmented dataset shows better performance on a test set when compared to a model built with only one canonical SMILES string per molecule. The correlation coefficient R2 on the test set was improved from 0.56 to 0.66 when using SMILES enumeration, and the root mean square error (RMS) likewise fell from 0.62 to 0.55. The technique also works in the prediction phase. By taking the average per molecule of the predictions for the enumerated SMILES a further improvement to a correlation coefficient of 0.68 and a RMS of 0.52 was found."}
{"text": "  Deep learning has shown promising results in many machine learning applications. The hierarchical feature representation built by deep networks enable compact and precise encoding of the data. A kernel analysis of the trained deep networks demonstrated that with deeper layers, more simple and more accurate data representations are obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for layer-wise training of a deep network for the supervised classification task. A transformation matrix of each layer is obtained by solving an optimization aimed at a better representation where a subsequent layer builds its representation on the top of the features produced by a previous layer. We compared the performance of our approach with a DNN trained using back-propagation which has same architecture as ours. Experimental results on the real image datasets demonstrate efficacy of our approach. We also performed kernel analysis of layer representations to validate the claim of better feature encoding."}
{"text": "  Kernel embeddings of distributions and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), the resulting distance between distributions, are useful tools for fully nonparametric two-sample testing and learning on distributions. However, it is rarely that all possible differences between samples are of interest -- discovered differences can be due to different types of measurement noise, data collection artefacts or other irrelevant sources of variability. We propose distances between distributions which encode invariance to additive symmetric noise, aimed at testing whether the assumed true underlying processes differ. Moreover, we construct invariant features of distributions, leading to learning algorithms robust to the impairment of the input distributions with symmetric additive noise."}
{"text": "  Finding features that disentangle the different causes of variation in real data is a difficult task, that has nonetheless received considerable attention in static domains like natural images. Interactive environments, in which an agent can deliberately take actions, offer an opportunity to tackle this task better, because the agent can experiment with different actions and observe their effects. We introduce the idea that in interactive environments, latent factors that control the variation in observed data can be identified by figuring out what the agent can control. We propose a naive method to find factors that explain or measure the effect of the actions of a learner, and test it in illustrative experiments."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of learning to partition users into groups, where one must learn the compatibilities between the users to achieve optimal groupings. We define four natural objectives that optimize for average and worst case compatibilities and propose new algorithms for adaptively learning optimal groupings. When we do not impose any structure on the compatibilities, we show that the group formation objectives considered are $NP$ hard to solve and we either give approximation guarantees or prove inapproximability results. We then introduce an elegant structure, namely that of \\textit{intrinsic scores}, that makes many of these problems polynomial time solvable. We explicitly characterize the optimal groupings under this structure and show that the optimal solutions are related to \\emph{homophilous} and \\emph{heterophilous} partitions, well-studied in the psychology literature. For one of the four objectives, we show $NP$ hardness under the score structure and give a $\\frac{1}{2}$ approximation algorithm for which no constant approximation was known thus far. Finally, under the score structure, we propose an online low sample complexity PAC algorithm for learning the optimal partition. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real world datasets."}
{"text": "  In this work, we propose several online methods to build a \\emph{learning curriculum} from a given set of target-task-specific training tasks in order to speed up reinforcement learning (RL). These methods can decrease the total training time needed by an RL agent compared to training on the target task from scratch. Unlike traditional transfer learning, we consider creating a sequence from several training tasks in order to provide the most benefit in terms of reducing the total time to train.   Our methods utilize the learning trajectory of the agent on the curriculum tasks seen so far to decide which tasks to train on next. An attractive feature of our methods is that they are weakly coupled to the choice of the RL algorithm as well as the transfer learning method. Further, when there is domain information available, our methods can incorporate such knowledge to further speed up the learning. We experimentally show that these methods can be used to obtain suitable learning curricula that speed up the overall training time on two different domains."}
{"text": "  We describe and analyze a simple random feature scheme (RFS) from prescribed compositional kernels. The compositional kernels we use are inspired by the structure of convolutional neural networks and kernels. The resulting scheme yields sparse and efficiently computable features. Each random feature can be represented as an algebraic expression over a small number of (random) paths in a composition tree. Thus, compositional random features can be stored compactly. The discrete nature of the generation process enables de-duplication of repeated features, further compacting the representation and increasing the diversity of the embeddings. Our approach complements and can be combined with previous random feature schemes."}
{"text": "  We present the first treatment of the arc length of the Gaussian Process (GP) with more than a single output dimension. GPs are commonly used for tasks such as trajectory modelling, where path length is a crucial quantity of interest. Previously, only paths in one dimension have been considered, with no theoretical consideration of higher dimensional problems. We fill the gap in the existing literature by deriving the moments of the arc length for a stationary GP with multiple output dimensions. A new method is used to derive the mean of a one-dimensional GP over a finite interval, by considering the distribution of the arc length integrand. This technique is used to derive an approximate distribution over the arc length of a vector valued GP in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by moment matching the distribution. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical derivations."}
{"text": "  The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has recently been successfully applied in robust regression, classification and adaptive filtering, where the correntropy is maximized instead of minimizing the well-known mean square error (MSE) to improve the robustness with respect to outliers (or impulsive noises). Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop various robust adaptive algorithms under MCC, but so far little insight has been gained as to how the optimal solution will be affected by outliers. In this work, we study this problem in the context of parameter estimation for a simple linear errors-in-variables (EIV) model where all variables are scalar. Under certain conditions, we derive an upper bound on the absolute value of the estimation error and show that the optimal solution under MCC can be very close to the true value of the unknown parameter even with outliers (whose values can be arbitrarily large) in both input and output variables. Illustrative examples are presented to verify and clarify the theory."}
{"text": "  Inferring the correct answers to binary tasks based on multiple noisy answers in an unsupervised manner has emerged as the canonical question for micro-task crowdsourcing or more generally aggregating opinions. In graphon estimation, one is interested in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes using a single snapshot of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from graphon estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than the {\\em majority voting} scheme for a setup that goes beyond the {\\em rank one} models considered in the literature. We use known explicit lower bounds for crowdsourcing to provide refined lower bounds for graphon estimation."}
{"text": "  How can we train a statistical mixture model on a massive data set? In this work we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians. A coreset is a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models fitting the coreset also provide a good fit for the original data set. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size polynomial in dimension and the number of mixture components, while being independent of the data set size. Hence, one can harness computationally intensive algorithms to compute a good approximation on a significantly smaller data set. More importantly, such coresets can be efficiently constructed both in distributed and streaming settings and do not impose restrictions on the data generating process. Our results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in computational geometry and new combinatorial complexity results for mixtures of Gaussians. Empirical evaluation on several real-world datasets suggests that our coreset-based approach enables significant reduction in training-time with negligible approximation error."}
{"text": "  We present a novel diffusion scheme for online kernel-based learning over networks. So far, a major drawback of any online learning algorithm, operating in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), is the need for updating a growing number of parameters as time iterations evolve. Besides complexity, this leads to an increased need of communication resources, in a distributed setting. In contrast, the proposed method approximates the solution as a fixed-size vector (of larger dimension than the input space) using Random Fourier Features. This paves the way to use standard linear combine-then-adapt techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete protocol for distributed online learning in RKHS is presented. Conditions for asymptotic convergence and boundness of the networkwise regret are also provided. The simulated tests illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme."}
{"text": "  There is growing interest in applying machine learning methods to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Across different institutions, however, EMR quality can vary widely. This work investigated the impact of this disparity on the performance of three advanced machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and recurrent neural network. The EMR disparity was emulated using different permutations of the EMR collected at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU). The algorithms were trained using patients from the PICU to predict in-ICU mortality for patients in a held out set of PICU and CTICU patients. The disparate patient populations between the PICU and CTICU provide an estimate of generalization errors across different ICUs. We quantified and evaluated the generalization of these algorithms on varying EMR size, input types, and fidelity of data."}
{"text": "  The paper reports an experimentally identified list of benchmark data sets that are hard for representative classification and feature selection methods. This was done after systematically evaluating a total of 48 combinations of methods, involving eight state-of-the-art classification algorithms and six commonly used feature selection methods, on 129 data sets from the UCI repository (some data sets with known high classification accuracy were excluded). In this paper, a data set for classification is called hard if none of the 48 combinations can achieve an AUC over 0.8 and none of them can achieve an F-Measure value over 0.8; it is called easy otherwise. A total of 15 out of the 129 data sets were found to be hard in that sense. This paper also compares the performance of different methods, and it produces rankings of classification methods, separately on the hard data sets and on the easy data sets. This paper is the first to rank methods separately for hard data sets and for easy data sets. It turns out that the classifier rankings resulting from our experiments are somehow different from those in the literature and hence they offer new insights on method selection. It should be noted that the Random Forest method remains to be the best in all groups of experiments."}
{"text": "  Augmenting an agent's control with useful higher-level behaviors called options can greatly reduce the sample complexity of reinforcement learning, but manually designing options is infeasible in high-dimensional and abstract state spaces. While recent work has proposed several techniques for automated option discovery, they do not scale to multi-level hierarchies and to expressive representations such as deep networks. We present Discovery of Deep Options (DDO), a policy-gradient algorithm that discovers parametrized options from a set of demonstration trajectories, and can be used recursively to discover additional levels of the hierarchy. The scalability of our approach to multi-level hierarchies stems from the decoupling of low-level option discovery from high-level meta-control policy learning, facilitated by under-parametrization of the high level. We demonstrate that using the discovered options to augment the action space of Deep Q-Network agents can accelerate learning by guiding exploration in tasks where random actions are unlikely to reach valuable states. We show that DDO is effective in adding options that accelerate learning in 4 out of 5 Atari RAM environments chosen in our experiments. We also show that DDO can discover structure in robot-assisted surgical videos and kinematics that match expert annotation with 72% accuracy."}
{"text": "  Under normality and homoscedasticity assumptions, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is known to be optimal in terms of minimising the Bayes error for binary classification. In the heteroscedastic case, LDA is not guaranteed to minimise this error. Assuming heteroscedasticity, we derive a linear classifier, the Gaussian Linear Discriminant (GLD), that directly minimises the Bayes error for binary classification. In addition, we also propose a local neighbourhood search (LNS) algorithm to obtain a more robust classifier if the data is known to have a non-normal distribution. We evaluate the proposed classifiers on two artificial and ten real-world datasets that cut across a wide range of application areas including handwriting recognition, medical diagnosis and remote sensing, and then compare our algorithm against existing LDA approaches and other linear classifiers. The GLD is shown to outperform the original LDA procedure in terms of the classification accuracy under heteroscedasticity. While it compares favourably with other existing heteroscedastic LDA approaches, the GLD requires as much as 60 times lower training time on some datasets. Our comparison with the support vector machine (SVM) also shows that, the GLD, together with the LNS, requires as much as 150 times lower training time to achieve an equivalent classification accuracy on some of the datasets. Thus, our algorithms can provide a cheap and reliable option for classification in a lot of expert systems."}
{"text": "  The Tabu Search (TS) metaheuristic has been proposed for K-Means clustering as an alternative to Lloyd's algorithm, which for all its ease of implementation and fast runtime, has the major drawback of being trapped at local optima. While the TS approach can yield superior performance, it involves a high computational complexity. Moreover, the difficulty in parameter selection in the existing TS approach does not make it any more attractive. This paper presents an alternative, low-complexity formulation of the TS optimization procedure for K-Means clustering. This approach does not require many parameter settings. We initially constrain the centers to points in the dataset. We then aim at evolving these centers using a unique neighborhood structure that makes use of gradient information of the objective function. This results in an efficient exploration of the search space, after which the means are refined. The proposed scheme is implemented in MATLAB and tested on four real-world datasets, and it achieves a significant improvement over the existing TS approach in terms of the intra cluster sum of squares and computational time."}
{"text": "  A variety of real-world processes (over networks) produce sequences of data whose complex temporal dynamics need to be studied. More especially, the event timestamps can carry important information about the underlying network dynamics, which otherwise are not available from the time-series evenly sampled from continuous signals. Moreover, in most complex processes, event sequences and evenly-sampled times series data can interact with each other, which renders joint modeling of those two sources of data necessary. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we utilize the rich framework of (temporal) point processes to model event data and timely update its intensity function by the synergic twin Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In the proposed architecture, the intensity function is synergistically modulated by one RNN with asynchronous events as input and another RNN with time series as input. Furthermore, to enhance the interpretability of the model, the attention mechanism for the neural point process is introduced. The whole model with event type and timestamp prediction output layers can be trained end-to-end and allows a black-box treatment for modeling the intensity. We substantiate the superiority of our model in synthetic data and three real-world benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "  Large-scale deep neural networks (DNN) have been successfully used in a number of tasks from image recognition to natural language processing. They are trained using large training sets on large models, making them computationally and memory intensive. As such, there is much interest in research development for faster training and test time. In this paper, we present a unique approach using lower precision weights for more efficient and faster training phase. We separate imagery into different frequency bands (e.g. with different information content) such that the neural net can better learn using less bits. We present this approach as a complement existing methods such as pruning network connections and encoding learning weights. We show results where this approach supports more stable learning with 2-4X reduction in precision with 17X reduction in DNN parameters."}
{"text": "  This paper deals with the problem of large-scale linear supervised learning in settings where a large number of continuous features are available. We propose to combine the well-known trick of one-hot encoding of continuous features with a new penalization called \\emph{binarsity}. In each group of binary features coming from the one-hot encoding of a single raw continuous feature, this penalization uses total-variation regularization together with an extra linear constraint. This induces two interesting properties on the model weights of the one-hot encoded features: they are piecewise constant, and are eventually block sparse. Non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for generalized linear models are proposed. Moreover, under a sparse additive model assumption, we prove that our procedure matches the state-of-the-art in this setting. Numerical experiments illustrate the good performances of our approach on several datasets. It is also noteworthy that our method has a numerical complexity comparable to standard $\\ell_1$ penalization."}
{"text": "  Integrating visual and linguistic information into a single multimodal representation is an unsolved problem with wide-reaching applications to both natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we present a simple method to build multimodal representations by learning a language-to-vision mapping and using its output to build multimodal embeddings. In this sense, our method provides a cognitively plausible way of building representations, consistent with the inherently re-constructive and associative nature of human memory. Using seven benchmark concept similarity tests we show that the mapped vectors not only implicitly encode multimodal information, but also outperform strong unimodal baselines and state-of-the-art multimodal methods, thus exhibiting more \"human-like\" judgments---particularly in zero-shot settings."}

Using metrics or distances for sets, we propose an approach to several multiple instance learning tasks, such as clustering (unsupervised learning), classification (supervised learning), and novelty detection (semi-supervised learning). In particular, we introduce the Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment metric to multiple instance learning so as to provide versatile design choices. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data are presented to illustrate the versatility of the proposed solution."}
{"text": "  Existing strategies for finite-armed stochastic bandits mostly depend on a parameter of scale that must be known in advance. Sometimes this is in the form of a bound on the payoffs, or the knowledge of a variance or subgaussian parameter. The notable exceptions are the analysis of Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance by Cowan and Katehakis [2015] and of uniform distributions with unknown support [Cowan and Katehakis, 2015]. The results derived in these specialised cases are generalised here to the non-parametric setup, where the learner knows only a bound on the kurtosis of the noise, which is a scale free measure of the extremity of outliers."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we present a joint compression and classification approach of EEG and EMG signals using a deep learning approach. Specifically, we build our system based on the deep autoencoder architecture which is designed not only to extract discriminant features in the multimodal data representation but also to reconstruct the data from the latent representation using encoder-decoder layers. Since autoencoder can be seen as a compression approach, we extend it to handle multimodal data at the encoder layer, reconstructed and retrieved at the decoder layer. We show through experimental results, that exploiting both multimodal data intercorellation and intracorellation 1) Significantly reduces signal distortion particularly for high compression levels 2) Achieves better accuracy in classifying EEG and EMG signals recorded and labeled according to the sentiments of the volunteer."}
{"text": "  We consider the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in linear quadratic (LQ) control problems, where the state dynamics is linear and the cost function is quadratic in states and controls. We analyze the regret of Thompson sampling (TS) (a.k.a. posterior-sampling for reinforcement learning) in the frequentist setting, i.e., when the parameters characterizing the LQ dynamics are fixed. Despite the empirical and theoretical success in a wide range of problems from multi-armed bandit to linear bandit, we show that when studying the frequentist regret TS in control problems, we need to trade-off the frequency of sampling optimistic parameters and the frequency of switches in the control policy. This results in an overall regret of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is significantly worse than the regret $O(\\sqrt{T})$ achieved by the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty algorithm in LQ control problems."}
{"text": "  We implemented several multilabel classification algorithms in the machine learning package mlr. The implemented methods are binary relevance, classifier chains, nested stacking, dependent binary relevance and stacking, which can be used with any base learner that is accessible in mlr. Moreover, there is access to the multilabel classification versions of randomForestSRC and rFerns. All these methods can be easily compared by different implemented multilabel performance measures and resampling methods in the standardized mlr framework. In a benchmark experiment with several multilabel datasets, the performance of the different methods is evaluated."}
{"text": "  Hawkes Processes capture self-excitation and mutual-excitation between events when the arrival of an event makes future events more likely to happen. Identification of such temporal covariance can reveal the underlying structure to better predict future events. In this paper, we present a new framework to decompose discrete events with a composition of multiple self-triggering kernels. The composition scheme allows us to decompose empirical covariance densities into the sum or the product of base kernels which are easily interpretable. Here, we present the first multiplicative kernel composition methods for Hawkes Processes. We demonstrate that the new automatic kernel decomposition procedure outperforms the existing methods on the prediction of discrete events in real-world data."}
{"text": "  In the scenario of real-time monitoring of hospital patients, high-quality inference of patients' health status using all information available from clinical covariates and lab tests is essential to enable successful medical interventions and improve patient outcomes. Developing a computational framework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) and make accurate real-time predictions is a critical step. In this work, we develop and explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on Gaussian process (GP) regression for hospital patient monitoring. We propose MedGP, a statistical framework that incorporates 24 clinical and lab covariates and supports a rich reference data set from which relationships between observed covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of patient state over time. To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP kernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points while estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and periodicity in patient observations. MedGP has a number of benefits over current methods, including (i) not requiring an alignment of the time series data, (ii) quantifying confidence regions in the predictions, (iii) exploiting a vast and rich database of patients, and (iv) inferring interpretable relationships among clinical covariates. We evaluate and compare results from MedGP on the task of online prediction for three patient subgroups from two medical data sets across 8,043 patients. We found MedGP improves online prediction over baseline methods for nearly all covariates across different disease subgroups and studies. The publicly available code is at https://github.com/bee-hive/MedGP."}
{"text": "  GPU activity prediction is an important and complex problem. This is due to the high level of contention among thousands of parallel threads. This problem was mostly addressed using heuristics. We propose a representation learning approach to address this problem. We model any performance metric as a temporal function of the executed instructions with the intuition that the flow of instructions can be identified as distinct activities of the code. Our experiments show high accuracy and non-trivial predictive power of representation learning on a benchmark."}
{"text": "  The development of computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction methods that significantly reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining high image quality is an important area of research in low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging. We propose a new penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) reconstruction method that exploits regularization based on an efficient Union of Learned TRAnsforms (PWLS-ULTRA). The union of square transforms is pre-learned from numerous image patches extracted from a dataset of CT images or volumes. The proposed PWLS-based cost function is optimized by alternating between a CT image reconstruction step, and a sparse coding and clustering step. The CT image reconstruction step is accelerated by a relaxed linearized augmented Lagrangian method with ordered-subsets that reduces the number of forward and back projections. Simulations with 2-D and 3-D axial CT scans of the extended cardiac-torso phantom and 3D helical chest and abdomen scans show that for both normal-dose and low-dose levels, the proposed method significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images compared to PWLS reconstruction with a nonadaptive edge-preserving regularizer (PWLS-EP). PWLS with regularization based on a union of learned transforms leads to better image reconstructions than using a single learned square transform. We also incorporate patch-based weights in PWLS-ULTRA that enhance image quality and help improve image resolution uniformity. The proposed approach achieves comparable or better image quality compared to learned overcomplete synthesis dictionaries, but importantly, is much faster (computationally more efficient)."}

{"text": "  Objectives: Discussions of fairness in criminal justice risk assessments typically lack conceptual precision. Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this paper, we seek to clarify the tradeoffs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy.   Methods: We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments.   Results: We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy.   Conclusions: Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time, and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging tradeoffs."}
{"text": "  One approach to Imitation Learning is Behavior Cloning, in which a robot observes a supervisor and infers a control policy. A known problem with this \"off-policy\" approach is that the robot's errors compound when drifting away from the supervisor's demonstrations. On-policy, techniques alleviate this by iteratively collecting corrective actions for the current robot policy. However, these techniques can be tedious for human supervisors, add significant computation burden, and may visit dangerous states during training. We propose an off-policy approach that injects noise into the supervisor's policy while demonstrating. This forces the supervisor to demonstrate how to recover from errors. We propose a new algorithm, DART (Disturbances for Augmenting Robot Trajectories), that collects demonstrations with injected noise, and optimizes the noise level to approximate the error of the robot's trained policy during data collection. We compare DART with DAgger and Behavior Cloning in two domains: in simulation with an algorithmic supervisor on the MuJoCo tasks (Walker, Humanoid, Hopper, Half-Cheetah) and in physical experiments with human supervisors training a Toyota HSR robot to perform grasping in clutter. For high dimensional tasks like Humanoid, DART can be up to $3x$ faster in computation time and only decreases the supervisor's cumulative reward by $5\\%$ during training, whereas DAgger executes policies that have $80\\%$ less cumulative reward than the supervisor. On the grasping in clutter task, DART obtains on average a $62\\%$ performance increase over Behavior Cloning."}
{"text": "  Analyzing multivariate time series data is important to predict future events and changes of complex systems in finance, manufacturing, and administrative decisions. The expressiveness power of Gaussian Process (GP) regression methods has been significantly improved by compositional covariance structures. In this paper, we present a new GP model which naturally handles multiple time series by placing an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior on the presence of shared kernels. Our selective covariance structure decomposition allows exploiting shared parameters over a set of multiple, selected time series. We also investigate the well-definedness of the models when infinite latent components are introduced. We present a pragmatic search algorithm which explores a larger structure space efficiently. Experiments conducted on five real-world data sets demonstrate that our new model outperforms existing methods in term of structure discoveries and predictive performances."}
{"text": "  We consider a generalization of low-rank matrix completion to the case where the data belongs to an algebraic variety, i.e. each data point is a solution to a system of polynomial equations. In this case the original matrix is possibly high-rank, but it becomes low-rank after mapping each column to a higher dimensional space of monomial features. Many well-studied extensions of linear models, including affine subspaces and their union, can be described by a variety model. In addition, varieties can be used to model a richer class of nonlinear quadratic and higher degree curves and surfaces. We study the sampling requirements for matrix completion under a variety model with a focus on a union of affine subspaces. We also propose an efficient matrix completion algorithm that minimizes a convex or non-convex surrogate of the rank of the matrix of monomial features. Our algorithm uses the well-known \"kernel trick\" to avoid working directly with the high-dimensional monomial matrix. We show the proposed algorithm is able to recover synthetically generated data up to the predicted sampling complexity bounds. The proposed algorithm also outperforms standard low rank matrix completion and subspace clustering techniques in experiments with real data."}
{"text": "  In high-dimensional and/or non-parametric regression problems, regularization (or penalization) is used to control model complexity and induce desired structure. Each penalty has a weight parameter that indicates how strongly the structure corresponding to that penalty should be enforced. Typically the parameters are chosen to minimize the error on a separate validation set using a simple grid search or a gradient-free optimization method. It is more efficient to tune parameters if the gradient can be determined, but this is often difficult for problems with non-smooth penalty functions. Here we show that for many penalized regression problems, the validation loss is actually smooth almost-everywhere with respect to the penalty parameters. We can therefore apply a modified gradient descent algorithm to tune parameters. Through simulation studies on example regression problems, we find that increasing the number of penalty parameters and tuning them using our method can decrease the generalization error."}
{"text": "  In this paper we investigate image classification with computational resource limits at test time. Two such settings are: 1. anytime classification, where the network's prediction for a test example is progressively updated, facilitating the output of a prediction at any time; and 2. budgeted batch classification, where a fixed amount of computation is available to classify a set of examples that can be spent unevenly across \"easier\" and \"harder\" inputs. In contrast to most prior work, such as the popular Viola and Jones algorithm, our approach is based on convolutional neural networks. We train multiple classifiers with varying resource demands, which we adaptively apply during test time. To maximally re-use computation between the classifiers, we incorporate them as early-exits into a single deep convolutional neural network and inter-connect them with dense connectivity. To facilitate high quality classification early on, we use a two-dimensional multi-scale network architecture that maintains coarse and fine level features all-throughout the network. Experiments on three image-classification tasks demonstrate that our framework substantially improves the existing state-of-the-art in both settings."}
{"text": "  Analyzing multivariate time series data is important for many applications such as automated control, fault diagnosis and anomaly detection. One of the key challenges is to learn latent features automatically from dynamically changing multivariate input. In visual recognition tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful to learn generalized feature extractors with shared parameters over the spatial domain. However, when high-dimensional multivariate time series is given, designing an appropriate CNN model structure becomes challenging because the kernels may need to be extended through the full dimension of the input volume. To address this issue, we present two structure learning algorithms for deep CNN models. Our algorithms exploit the covariance structure over multiple time series to partition input volume into groups. The first algorithm learns the group CNN structures explicitly by clustering individual input sequences. The second algorithm learns the group CNN structures implicitly from the error backpropagation. In experiments with two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our group CNNs outperform existing CNN based regression methods."}
{"text": "  Spectral clustering is a popular and versatile clustering method based on a relaxation of the normalised graph cut objective. Despite its popularity, however, there is no single agreed upon method for tuning the important scaling parameter, nor for determining automatically the number of clusters to extract. Popular heuristics exist, but corresponding theoretical results are scarce. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic value of the normalised cut for an increasing sample assumed to arise from an underlying probability distribution, and based on this result provide recommendations for improving spectral clustering methodology. A corresponding algorithm is proposed with strong empirical performance."}
{"text": "  The trade-off between the cost of acquiring and processing data, and uncertainty due to a lack of data is fundamental in machine learning. A basic instance of this trade-off is the problem of deciding when to make noisy and costly observations of a discrete-time Gaussian random walk, so as to minimise the posterior variance plus observation costs. We present the first proof that a simple policy, which observes when the posterior variance exceeds a threshold, is optimal for this problem. The proof generalises to a wide range of cost functions other than the posterior variance.   This result implies that optimal policies for linear-quadratic-Gaussian control with costly observations have a threshold structure. It also implies that the restless bandit problem of observing multiple such time series, has a well-defined Whittle index. We discuss computation of that index, give closed-form formulae for it, and compare the performance of the associated index policy with heuristic policies.   The proof is based on a new verification theorem that demonstrates threshold structure for Markov decision processes, and on the relation between binary sequences known as mechanical words and the dynamics of discontinuous nonlinear maps, which frequently arise in physics, control and biology."}
{"text": "  In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and portable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However, data for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online learning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides, we find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and connected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic RL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method in all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective policies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm start trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization of our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised learning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related tasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that in a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious improvements over the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "  The inverse mapping of GANs'(Generative Adversarial Nets) generator has a great potential value.Hence, some works have been developed to construct the inverse function of generator by directly learning or adversarial learning.While the results are encouraging, the problem is highly challenging and the existing ways of training inverse models of GANs have many disadvantages, such as hard to train or poor performance.Due to these reasons, we propose a new approach based on using inverse generator ($IG$) model as encoder and pre-trained generator ($G$) as decoder of an AutoEncoder network to train the $IG$ model. In the proposed model, the difference between the input and output, which are both the generated image of pre-trained GAN's generator, of AutoEncoder is directly minimized. The optimizing method can overcome the difficulty in training and inverse model of an non one-to-one function.We also applied the inverse model of GANs' generators to image searching and translation.The experimental results prove that the proposed approach works better than the traditional approaches in image searching."}
{"text": "  Traditional manifold learning algorithms often bear an assumption that the local neighborhood of any point on embedded manifold is roughly equal to the tangent space at that point without considering the curvature. The curvature indifferent way of manifold processing often makes traditional dimension reduction poorly neighborhood preserving. To overcome this drawback we propose a new algorithm called RF-ML to perform an operation on the manifold with help of Ricci flow before reducing the dimension of manifold."}
{"text": "  Objective: In this work, we perform margin assessment of human breast tissue from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using deep neural networks (DNNs). This work simulates an intraoperative setting for breast cancer lumpectomy. Methods: To train the DNNs, we use both the state-of-the-art methods (Weight Decay and DropOut) and a newly introduced regularization method based on function norms. Commonly used methods can fail when only a small database is available. The use of a function norm introduces a direct control over the complexity of the function with the aim of diminishing the risk of overfitting. Results: As neither the code nor the data of previous results are publicly available, the obtained results are compared with reported results in the literature for a conservative comparison. Moreover, our method is applied to locally collected data on several data configurations. The reported results are the average over the different trials. Conclusion: The experimental results show that the use of DNNs yields significantly better results than other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, G-mean and Matthews correlation coefficient. Function norm regularization yielded higher and more robust results than competing methods. Significance: We have demonstrated a system that shows high promise for (partially) automated margin assessment of human breast tissue, Equal error rate (EER) is reduced from approximately 12\\% (the lowest reported in the literature) to 5\\%\\,--\\,a 58\\% reduction. The method is computationally feasible for intraoperative application (less than 2 seconds per image)."}
{"text": "  Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results."}
{"text": "  Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 - 2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers."}
{"text": "  One of the defining properties of deep learning is that models are chosen to have many more parameters than available training data. In light of this capacity for overfitting, it is remarkable that simple algorithms like SGD reliably return solutions with low test error. One roadblock to explaining these phenomena in terms of implicit regularization, structural properties of the solution, and/or easiness of the data is that many learning bounds are quantitatively vacuous when applied to networks learned by SGD in this \"deep learning\" regime. Logically, in order to explain generalization, we need nonvacuous bounds. We return to an idea by Langford and Caruana (2001), who used PAC-Bayes bounds to compute nonvacuous numerical bounds on generalization error for stochastic two-layer two-hidden-unit neural networks via a sensitivity analysis. By optimizing the PAC-Bayes bound directly, we are able to extend their approach and obtain nonvacuous generalization bounds for deep stochastic neural network classifiers with millions of parameters trained on only tens of thousands of examples. We connect our findings to recent and old work on flat minima and MDL-based explanations of generalization."}
{"text": "  An exciting branch of machine learning research focuses on methods for learning, optimizing, and integrating unknown functions that are difficult or costly to evaluate. A popular Bayesian approach to this problem uses a Gaussian process (GP) to construct a posterior distribution over the function of interest given a set of observed measurements, and selects new points to evaluate using the statistics of this posterior. Here we extend these methods to exploit derivative information from the unknown function. We describe methods for Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian quadrature (BQ) in settings where first and second derivatives may be evaluated along with the function itself. We perform sampling-based inference in order to incorporate uncertainty over hyperparameters, and show that both hyperparameter and function uncertainty decrease much more rapidly when using derivative information. Moreover, we introduce techniques for overcoming ill-conditioning issues that have plagued earlier methods for gradient-enhanced Gaussian processes and kriging. We illustrate the efficacy of these methods using applications to real and simulated Bayesian optimization and quadrature problems, and show that exploting derivatives can provide substantial gains over standard methods."}
{"text": "  Motivated by e-commerce, we study the online assortment optimization problem. The seller offers an assortment, i.e. a subset of products, to each arriving customer, who then purchases one or no product from her offered assortment. A customer's purchase decision is governed by the underlying MultiNomial Logit (MNL) choice model. The seller aims to maximize the total revenue in a finite sales horizon, subject to resource constraints and uncertainty in the MNL choice model. We first propose an efficient online policy which incurs a regret $\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, where $T$ is the number of customers in the sales horizon. Then, we propose a UCB policy that achieves a regret $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$. Both regret bounds are sublinear in the number of assortments."}
{"text": "  Ensembles of neural networks are known to be much more robust and accurate than individual networks. However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters. To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique, which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling, is simple, yet surprisingly effective. We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain error rates of 3.4% and 17.4% respectively."}
{"text": "  We introduce a novel validation framework to measure the true robustness of learning models for real-world applications by creating source-inclusive and source-exclusive partitions in a dataset via clustering. We develop a robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels."}
{"text": "  Concept drift is a major issue that greatly affects the accuracy and reliability of many real-world applications of machine learning. We argue that to tackle concept drift it is important to develop the capacity to describe and analyze it. We propose tools for this purpose, arguing for the importance of quantitative descriptions of drift in marginal distributions. We present quantitative drift analysis techniques along with methods for communicating their results. We demonstrate their effectiveness by application to three real-world learning tasks."}
{"text": "  We consider the stochastic bandit problem with a continuous set of arms, with the expected reward function over the arms assumed to be fixed but unknown. We provide two new Gaussian process-based algorithms for continuous bandit optimization-Improved GP-UCB (IGP-UCB) and GP-Thomson sampling (GP-TS), and derive corresponding regret bounds. Specifically, the bounds hold when the expected reward function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that naturally corresponds to a Gaussian process kernel used as input by the algorithms. Along the way, we derive a new self-normalized concentration inequality for vector- valued martingales of arbitrary, possibly infinite, dimension. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparisons to existing algorithms on synthetic and real-world environments are carried out that highlight the favorable gains of the proposed strategies in many cases."}
{"text": "  To ensure interpretability of extracted sources in tensor decomposition, we introduce in this paper a dictionary-based tensor canonical polyadic decomposition which enforces one factor to belong exactly to a known dictionary. A new formulation of sparse coding is proposed which enables high dimensional tensors dictionary-based canonical polyadic decomposition. The benefits of using a dictionary in tensor decomposition models are explored both in terms of parameter identifiability and estimation accuracy. Performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated on the decomposition of simulated data and the unmixing of hyperspectral images."}
{"text": "  Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels."}
{"text": "  It has recently been shown that many of the existing quasi-Newton algorithms can be formulated as learning algorithms, capable of learning local models of the cost functions. Importantly, this understanding allows us to safely start assembling probabilistic Newton-type algorithms, applicable in situations where we only have access to noisy observations of the cost function and its derivatives. This is where our interest lies.   We make contributions to the use of the non-parametric and probabilistic Gaussian process models in solving these stochastic optimisation problems. Specifically, we present a new algorithm that unites these approximations together with recent probabilistic line search routines to deliver a probabilistic quasi-Newton approach.   We also show that the probabilistic optimisation algorithms deliver promising results on challenging nonlinear system identification problems where the very nature of the problem is such that we can only access the cost function and its derivative via noisy observations, since there are no closed-form expressions available."}
{"text": "  We study a model where one target variable Y is correlated with a vector X:=(X_1,...,X_d) of predictor variables being potential causes of Y. We describe a method that infers to what extent the statistical dependences between X and Y are due to the influence of X on Y and to what extent due to a hidden common cause (confounder) of X and Y. The method relies on concentration of measure results for large dimensions d and an independence assumption stating that, in the absence of confounding, the vector of regression coefficients describing the influence of each X on Y typically has `generic orientation' relative to the eigenspaces of the covariance matrix of X. For the special case of a scalar confounder we show that confounding typically spoils this generic orientation in a characteristic way that can be used to quantitatively estimate the amount of confounding."}
{"text": "  The key issues pertaining to collection of epidemic disease data for our analysis purposes are that it is a labour intensive, time consuming and expensive process resulting in availability of sparse sample data which we use to develop prediction models. To address this sparse data issue, we present novel Incremental Transductive methods to circumvent the data collection process by applying previously acquired data to provide consistent, confidence-based labelling alternatives to field survey research. We investigated various reasoning approaches for semisupervised machine learning including Bayesian models for labelling data. The results show that using the proposed methods, we can label instances of data with a class of vector density at a high level of confidence. By applying the Liberal and Strict Training Approaches, we provide a labelling and classification alternative to standalone algorithms. The methods in this paper are components in the process of reducing the proliferation of the Schistosomiasis disease and its effects."}
{"text": "  Cluster analysis of very high dimensional data can benefit from the properties of such high dimensionality. Informally expressed, in this work, our focus is on the analogous situation when the dimensionality is moderate to small, relative to a massively sized set of observations. Mathematically expressed, these are the dual spaces of observations and attributes. The point cloud of observations is in attribute space, and the point cloud of attributes is in observation space. In this paper, we begin by summarizing various perspectives related to methodologies that are used in multivariate analytics. We draw on these to establish an efficient clustering processing pipeline, both partitioning and hierarchical clustering."}
{"text": "  Integrative analysis of disparate data blocks measured on a common set of experimental subjects is a major challenge in modern data analysis. This data structure naturally motivates the simultaneous exploration of the joint and individual variation within each data block resulting in new insights. For instance, there is a strong desire to integrate the multiple genomic data sets in The Cancer Genome Atlas to characterize the common and also the unique aspects of cancer genetics and cell biology for each source. In this paper we introduce Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained capturing both joint and individual variation within each data block. This is a major improvement over earlier approaches to this challenge in terms of a new conceptual understanding, much better adaption to data heterogeneity and a fast linear algebra computation. Important mathematical contributions are the use of score subspaces as the principal descriptors of variation structure and the use of perturbation theory as the guide for variation segmentation. This leads to an exploratory data analysis method which is insensitive to the heterogeneity among data blocks and does not require separate normalization. An application to cancer data reveals different behaviors of each type of signal in characterizing tumor subtypes. An application to a mortality data set reveals interesting historical lessons.

{"text": "  The \"least absolute shrinkage and selection operator\" (Lasso) method has been adapted recently for networkstructured datasets. In particular, this network Lasso method allows to learn graph signals from a small number of noisy signal samples by using the total variation of a graph signal for regularization. While efficient and scalable implementations of the network Lasso are available, only little is known about the conditions on the underlying network structure which ensure network Lasso to be accurate. By leveraging concepts of compressed sensing, we address this gap and derive precise conditions on the underlying network topology and sampling set which guarantee the network Lasso for a particular loss function to deliver an accurate estimate of the entire underlying graph signal. We also quantify the error incurred by network Lasso in terms of two constants which reflect the connectivity of the sampled nodes."}
{"text": "  Super-resolution is a classical problem in image processing, with numerous applications to remote sensing image enhancement. Here, we address the super-resolution of irregularly-sampled remote sensing images. Using an optimal interpolation as the low-resolution reconstruction, we explore locally-adapted multimodal convolutional models and investigate different dictionary-based decompositions, namely based on principal component analysis (PCA), sparse priors and non-negativity constraints. We consider an application to the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) fields from two information sources, along-track altimeter data and sea surface temperature (SST) data. The reported experiments demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model, especially locally-adapted parametrizations with non-negativity constraints, to outperform optimally-interpolated reconstructions."}
{"text": "  Clustering is a useful data exploratory method with its wide applicability in multiple fields. However, data clustering greatly relies on initialization of cluster centers that can result in large intra-cluster variance and dead centers, therefore leading to sub-optimal solutions. This paper proposes a novel variance based version of the conventional Moving K-Means (MKM) algorithm called Variance Based Moving K-Means (VMKM) that can partition data into optimal homogeneous clusters, irrespective of cluster initialization. The algorithm utilizes a novel distance metric and a unique data element selection criteria to transfer the selected elements between clusters to achieve low intra-cluster variance and subsequently avoid dead centers. Quantitative and qualitative comparison with various clustering techniques is performed on four datasets selected from image processing, bioinformatics, remote sensing and the stock market respectively. An extensive analysis highlights the superior performance of the proposed method over other techniques."}
{"text": "  In this paper we propose the Augmented-UCB (AugUCB) algorithm for a fixed-budget version of the thresholding bandit problem (TBP), where the objective is to identify a set of arms whose quality is above a threshold. A key feature of AugUCB is that it uses both mean and variance estimates to eliminate arms that have been sufficiently explored; to the best of our knowledge this is the first algorithm to employ such an approach for the considered TBP. Theoretically, we obtain an upper bound on the loss (probability of mis-classification) incurred by AugUCB. Although UCBEV in literature provides a better guarantee, it is important to emphasize that UCBEV has access to problem complexity (whose computation requires arms' mean and variances), and hence is not realistic in practice; this is in contrast to AugUCB whose implementation does not require any such complexity inputs. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to validate the performance of AugUCB. Through our simulation work, we establish that AugUCB, owing to its utilization of variance estimates, performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art APT, CSAR and other non variance-based algorithms."}

The aim of this work is to introduce the reader to the concepts behind the Temporal Group LASSO and its related methods, as well as to the type of potential applications in a healthcare setting that the method has. We argue that the method is attractive because of its ability to reduce overfitting, select predictors, learn smooth effect patterns over time, and finally, its simplicity"}
{"text": "  Clustering is a widely-used data mining tool, which aims to discover partitions of similar items in data. We introduce a new clustering paradigm, \\emph{accordant clustering}, which enables the discovery of (predefined) group level insights. Unlike previous clustering paradigms that aim to understand relationships amongst the individual members, the goal of accordant clustering is to uncover insights at the group level through the analysis of their members. Group level insight can often support a call to action that cannot be informed through previous clustering techniques. We propose the first accordant clustering algorithm, and prove that it finds near-optimal solutions when data possesses inherent cluster structure. The insights revealed by accordant clusterings enabled experts in the field of medicine to isolate successful treatments for a neurodegenerative disease, and those in finance to discover patterns of unnecessary spending."}
{"text": "  Policy gradient methods have been successfully applied to many complex reinforcement learning problems. However, policy gradient methods suffer from high variance, slow convergence, and inefficient exploration. In this work, we introduce a maximum entropy policy optimization framework which explicitly encourages parameter exploration, and show that this framework can be reduced to a Bayesian inference problem. We then propose a novel Stein variational policy gradient method (SVPG) which combines existing policy gradient methods and a repulsive functional to generate a set of diverse but well-behaved policies. SVPG is robust to initialization and can easily be implemented in a parallel manner. On continuous control problems, we find that implementing SVPG on top of REINFORCE and advantage actor-critic algorithms improves both average return and data efficiency."}
{"text": "  This paper describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which, with interactive graphics, can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this paper, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using the ggplot2, plotly, and shiny packages."}
{"text": "  In this paper we study the problem of noisy tensor completion for tensors that admit a canonical polyadic or CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition with one of the factors being sparse. We present general theoretical error bounds for an estimate obtained by using a complexity-regularized maximum likelihood principle and then instantiate these bounds for the case of additive white Gaussian noise. We also provide an ADMM-type algorithm for solving the complexity-regularized maximum likelihood problem and validate the theoretical finding via experiments on synthetic data set."}
{"text": "  We study strictly proper scoring rules in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We propose a general Kernel Scoring rule and associated Kernel Divergence. We consider conditions under which the Kernel Score is strictly proper. We then demonstrate that the Kernel Score includes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy as a special case. We also consider the connections between the Kernel Score and the minimum risk of a proper loss function. We show that the Kernel Score incorporates more information pertaining to the projected embedded distributions compared to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Finally, we show how to integrate the information provided from different Kernel Divergences, such as the proposed Bhattacharyya Kernel Divergence, using a one-class classifier for improved two-sample hypothesis testing results."}

There exists a few Java libraries for MLC, but no MATLAB/OCTAVE library that covers various methods.

{"text": "  In this paper, we present a new feature selection method that is suitable for both unsupervised and supervised problems. We build upon the recently proposed Infinite Feature Selection (IFS) method where feature subsets of all sizes (including infinity) are considered. We extend IFS in two ways. First, we propose a supervised version of it. Second, we propose new ways of forming the feature adjacency matrix that perform better for unsupervised problems. We extensively evaluate our methods on many benchmark datasets, including large image-classification datasets (PASCAL VOC), and show that our methods outperform both the IFS and the widely used \"minimum-redundancy maximum-relevancy (mRMR)\" feature selection algorithm."}
{"text": "  In Valiant's model of evolution, a class of representations is evolvable iff a polynomial-time process of random mutations guided by selection converges with high probability to a representation as $\\epsilon$-close as desired from the optimal one, for any required $\\epsilon>0$. Several previous positive results exist that can be related to evolving a vector space, but each former result imposes disproportionate representations or restrictions on (re)initialisations, distributions, performance functions and/or the mutator. In this paper, we show that all it takes to evolve a normed vector space is merely a set that generates the space. Furthermore, it takes only $\\tilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ steps and it is essentially stable, agnostic and handles target drifts that rival some proven in fairly restricted settings. Our algorithm can be viewed as a close relative to a popular fifty-years old gradient-free optimization method for which little is still known from the convergence standpoint: Nelder-Mead simplex method."}
{"text": "  Predicated on the increasing abundance of electronic health records, we investi- gate the problem of inferring individualized treatment effects using observational data. Stemming from the potential outcomes model, we propose a novel multi- task learning framework in which factual and counterfactual outcomes are mod- eled as the outputs of a function in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vvRKHS). We develop a nonparametric Bayesian method for learning the treatment effects using a multi-task Gaussian process (GP) with a linear coregion- alization kernel as a prior over the vvRKHS. The Bayesian approach allows us to compute individualized measures of confidence in our estimates via pointwise credible intervals, which are crucial for realizing the full potential of precision medicine. The impact of selection bias is alleviated via a risk-based empirical Bayes method for adapting the multi-task GP prior, which jointly minimizes the empirical error in factual outcomes and the uncertainty in (unobserved) counter- factual outcomes. We conduct experiments on observational datasets for an inter- ventional social program applied to premature infants, and a left ventricular assist device applied to cardiac patients wait-listed for a heart transplant. In both experi- ments, we show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "  Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals."}
{"text": "  The standard interpretation of importance-weighted autoencoders is that they maximize a tighter lower bound on the marginal likelihood than the standard evidence lower bound. We give an alternate interpretation of this procedure: that it optimizes the standard variational lower bound, but using a more complex distribution. We formally derive this result, present a tighter lower bound, and visualize the implicit importance-weighted distribution."}
{"text": "  Real-world relations among entities can often be observed and determined by different perspectives/views. For example, the decision made by a user on whether to adopt an item relies on multiple aspects such as the contextual information of the decision, the item's attributes, the user's profile and the reviews given by other users. Different views may exhibit multi-way interactions among entities and provide complementary information. In this paper, we introduce a multi-tensor-based approach that can preserve the underlying structure of multi-view data in a generic predictive model. Specifically, we propose structural factorization machines (SFMs) that learn the common latent spaces shared by multi-view tensors and automatically adjust the importance of each view in the predictive model. Furthermore, the complexity of SFMs is linear in the number of parameters, which make SFMs suitable to large-scale problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed SFMs outperform several state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational cost."}
{"text": "  It has been believed that stochastic feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) have several advantages beyond deterministic deep neural networks (DNNs): they have more expressive power allowing multi-modal mappings and regularize better due to their stochastic nature. However, training large-scale SFNN is notoriously harder. In this paper, we aim at developing efficient training methods for SFNN, in particular using known architectures and pre-trained parameters of DNN. To this end, we propose a new intermediate stochastic model, called Simplified-SFNN, which can be built upon any baseline DNNand approximates certain SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. The main novelty of our approach is in establishing the connection between three models, i.e., DNN->Simplified-SFNN->SFNN, which naturally leads to an efficient training procedure of the stochastic models utilizing pre-trained parameters of DNN. Using several popular DNNs, we show how they can be effectively transferred to the corresponding stochastic models for both multi-modal and classification tasks on MNIST, TFD, CASIA, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. In particular, we train a stochastic model of 28 layers and 36 million parameters, where training such a large-scale stochastic network is significantly challenging without using Simplified-SFNN"}
{"text": "  The Matlab toolbox SciXMiner is designed for the visualization and analysis of time series and features with a special focus to classification problems. It was developed at the Institute of Applied Computer Science of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a member of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres in Germany. The aim was to provide an open platform for the development and improvement of data mining methods and its applications to various medical and technical problems. SciXMiner bases on Matlab (tested for the version 2017a). Many functions do not require additional standard toolboxes but some parts of Signal, Statistics and Wavelet toolboxes are used for special cases. The decision to a Matlab-based solution was made to use the wide mathematical functionality of this package provided by The Mathworks Inc. SciXMiner is controlled by a graphical user interface (GUI) with menu items and control elements like popup lists, checkboxes and edit elements. This makes it easier to work with SciXMiner for inexperienced users. Furthermore, an automatization and batch standardization of analyzes is possible using macros.

{"text": "  Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged during the last few years as an effective approach to optimizing black-box functions where direct queries of the objective are expensive. In this paper we consider the case where direct access to the function is not possible, but information about user preferences is. Such scenarios arise in problems where human preferences are modeled, such as A/B tests or recommender systems. We present a new framework for this scenario that we call Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) which allows us to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be queried through pairwise comparisons, the so-called duels. PBO extends the applicability of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by modeling the probability of the winner of each duel by means of a Gaussian process model with a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO. We illustrate the benefits of PBO in a variety of experiments, showing that PBO needs drastically fewer comparisons for finding the optimum. According to our experiments, the way of modeling correlations in PBO is key in obtaining this advantage."}
{"text": "  Extreme multi-label learning (XML) or classification has been a practical and important problem since the boom of big data. The main challenge lies in the exponential label space which involves $2^L$ possible label sets especially when the label dimension $L$ is huge, e.g., in millions for Wikipedia labels. This paper is motivated to better explore the label space by originally establishing an explicit label graph. In the meanwhile, deep learning has been widely studied and used in various classification problems including multi-label classification, however it has not been properly introduced to XML, where the label space can be as large as in millions. In this paper, we propose a practical deep embedding method for extreme multi-label classification, which harvests the ideas of non-linear embedding and graph priors-based label space modeling simultaneously. Extensive experiments on public datasets for XML show that our method performs competitive against state-of-the-art result."}
{"text": "  When you need to enable deep learning on low-cost embedded SoCs, is it better to port an existing deep learning framework or should you build one from scratch? In this paper, we share our practical experiences of building an embedded inference engine using ARM Compute Library (ACL). The results show that, contradictory to conventional wisdoms, for simple models, it takes much less development time to build an inference engine from scratch compared to porting existing frameworks. In addition, by utilizing ACL, we managed to build an inference engine that outperforms TensorFlow by 25%. Our conclusion is that, on embedded devices, we most likely will use very simple deep learning models for inference, and with well-developed building blocks such as ACL, it may be better in both performance and development time to build the engine from scratch."}

However, the convergence of Gaus- sian BP is still an open issue. In this paper, we consider the convergence of Gaussian BP, focusing in particular on the convergence of the information matrix. We show analytically that the exchanged message information matrix converges for arbitrary positive semidefinite initial value, and its dis- tance to the unique positive definite limit matrix decreases exponentially fast."}
{"text": "  Matrix factorisation methods decompose multivariate observations as linear combinations of latent feature vectors. The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) provides a way to model the number of latent features required for a good approximation in terms of regularised reconstruction error. Previous work has focussed on latent feature vectors with independent entries. We extend the model to include nondiagonal latent covariance structures representing characteristics such as smoothness. This is done by . Using simulations we demonstrate that under appropriate conditions a smoothness prior helps to recover the true latent features, while denoising more accurately. We demonstrate our method on a real neuroimaging dataset, where computational tractability is a sufficient challenge that the efficient strategy presented here is essential."}
{"text": "  The Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm has been widely used in solving nuclear norm constrained problems, since it does not require projections. However, FW often yields high rank intermediate iterates, which can be very expensive in time and space costs for large problems. To address this issue, we propose a rank-drop method for nuclear norm constrained problems. The goal is to generate descent steps that lead to rank decreases, maintaining low-rank solutions throughout the algorithm. Moreover, the optimization problems are constrained to ensure that the rank-drop step is also feasible and can be readily incorporated into a projection-free minimization method, e.g., Frank-Wolfe. We demonstrate that by incorporating rank-drop steps into the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the rank of the solution is greatly reduced compared to the original Frank-Wolfe or its common variants."}
{"text": "  We present a new kernel-based algorithm for modeling evenly distributed multidimensional datasets that does not rely on input space sparsification. The presented method reorganizes the typical single-layer kernel-based model into a deep hierarchical structure, such that the weights of a kernel model over each dimension are modeled over its adjacent dimension. We show that modeling weights in the suggested structure leads to significant computational speedup and improved modeling accuracy."}
{"text": "  We show that $k$-means (Lloyd's algorithm) is obtained as a special case when truncated variational EM approximations are applied to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with isotropic Gaussians. In contrast to the standard way to relate $k$-means and GMMs, the provided derivation shows that it is not required to consider Gaussians with small variances or the limit case of zero variances. There are a number of consequences that directly follow from our approach: (A) $k$-means can be shown to increase a free energy associated with truncated distributions and this free energy can directly be reformulated in terms of the $k$-means objective; (B) $k$-means generalizations can directly be derived by considering the 2nd closest, 3rd closest etc. cluster in addition to just the closest one; and (C) the embedding of $k$-means into a free energy framework allows for theoretical interpretations of other $k$-means generalizations in the literature. In general, truncated variational EM provides a natural and rigorous quantitative link between $k$-means-like clustering and GMM clustering algorithms which may be very relevant for future theoretical and empirical studies."}
{"text": "  Boosting as gradient descent algorithms is one popular method in machine learning. In this paper a novel Boosting-type algorithm is proposed based on restricted gradient descent with structural sparsity control whose underlying dynamics are governed by differential inclusions. In particular, we present an iterative regularization path with structural sparsity where the parameter is sparse under some linear transforms, based on variable splitting and the Linearized Bregman Iteration. Hence it is called \\emph{Split LBI}. Despite its simplicity, Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a proper early stopping, Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore, some $\\ell_2$ error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by several applications including image denoising, partial order ranking of sport teams, and world university grouping with crowdsourced ranking data."}
{"text": "  Neural Networks are function approximators that have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in numerous machine learning tasks. In spite of their great success in terms of accuracy, their large training time makes it difficult to use them for various tasks. In this paper, we explore the idea of learning weight evolution pattern from a simple network for accelerating training of novel neural networks. We use a neural network to learn the training pattern from MNIST classification and utilize it to accelerate training of neural networks used for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification. Our method has a low memory footprint and is computationally efficient. This method can also be used with other optimizers to give faster convergence. The results indicate a general trend in the weight evolution during training of neural networks."}
{"text": "  A new method for learning variational autoencoders (VAEs) is developed, based on Stein variational gradient descent. A key advantage of this approach is that one need not make parametric assumptions about the form of the encoder distribution.

Excellent performance is demonstrated across multiple unsupervised and semi-supervised problems, including semi-supervised analysis of the ImageNet data, demonstrating the scalability of the model to large datasets."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of accelerating distributed optimization in multi-agent networks by sequentially adding edges. Specifically, we extend the distributed dual averaging (DDA) subgradient algorithm to evolving networks of growing connectivity and analyze the corresponding improvement in convergence rate. It is known that the convergence rate of DDA is influenced by the algebraic connectivity of the underlying network, where better connectivity leads to faster convergence. However, the impact of network topology design on the convergence rate of DDA has not been fully understood. In this paper, we begin by designing network topologies via edge selection and scheduling. For edge selection, we determine the best set of candidate edges that achieves the optimal tradeoff between the growth of network connectivity and the usage of network resources. The dynamics of network evolution is then incurred by edge scheduling. Further, we provide a tractable approach to analyze the improvement in the convergence rate of DDA induced by the growth of network connectivity. Our analysis reveals the connection between network topology design and the convergence rate of DDA, and provides quantitative evaluation of DDA acceleration for distributed optimization that is absent in the existing analysis. Lastly, numerical experiments show that DDA can be significantly accelerated using a sequence of well-designed networks, and our theoretical predictions are well matched to its empirical convergence behavior."}
{"text": "  We propose a novel adaptive importance sampling algorithm which incorporates Stein variational gradient decent algorithm (SVGD) with importance sampling (IS). Our algorithm leverages the nonparametric transforms in SVGD to iteratively decrease the KL divergence between our importance proposal and the target distribution. The advantages of this algorithm are twofold: first, our algorithm turns SVGD into a standard IS algorithm, allowing us to use standard diagnostic and analytic tools of IS to evaluate and interpret the results; second, we do not restrict the choice of our importance proposal to predefined distribution families like traditional (adaptive) IS methods. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm performs well on evaluating partition functions of restricted Boltzmann machines and testing likelihood of variational auto-encoders."}
{"text": "  Predicting the subcellular localization of proteins is an important and challenging problem. Traditional experimental approaches are often expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, a growing number of research efforts employ a series of machine learning approaches to predict the subcellular location of proteins. There are two main challenges among the state-of-the-art prediction methods. First, most of the existing techniques are designed to deal with multi-class rather than multi-label classification, which ignores connections between multiple labels. In reality, multiple locations of particular proteins implies that there are vital and unique biological significances that deserve special focus and cannot be ignored. Second, techniques for handling imbalanced data in multi-label classification problems are necessary, but never employed. For solving these two issues, we have developed an ensemble multi-label classifier called HPSLPred, which can be applied for multi-label classification with an imbalanced protein source. For convenience, a user-friendly webserver has been established at http://server.malab.cn/HPSLPred."}
{"text": "  Despite being so vital to success of Support Vector Machines, the principle of separating margin maximisation is not used in deep learning. We show that minimisation of margin variance and not maximisation of the margin is more suitable for improving generalisation in deep architectures. We propose the Halfway loss function that minimises the Normalised Margin Variance (NMV) at the output of a deep learning models and evaluate its performance against the Softmax Cross-Entropy loss on the MNIST, smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets."}
{"text": "  Variational inference approximates the posterior distribution of a probabilistic model with a parameterized density by maximizing a lower bound for the model evidence. Modern solutions fit a flexible approximation with stochastic gradient descent, using Monte Carlo approximation for the gradients. This enables variational inference for arbitrary differentiable probabilistic models, and consequently makes variational inference feasible for probabilistic programming languages. In this work we develop more efficient inference algorithms for the task by considering importance sampling estimates for the gradients. We show how the gradient with respect to the approximation parameters can often be evaluated efficiently without needing to re-compute gradients of the model itself, and then proceed to derive practical algorithms that use importance sampled estimates to speed up computation.We present importance sampled stochastic gradient descent that outperforms standard stochastic gradient descent by a clear margin for a range of models, and provide a justifiable variant of stochastic average gradients for variational inference."}
{"text": "  We study the problem of interactively learning a binary classifier using noisy labeling and pairwise comparison oracles, where the comparison oracle answers which one in the given two instances is more likely to be positive. Learning from such oracles has multiple applications where obtaining direct labels is harder but pairwise comparisons are easier, and the algorithm can leverage both types of oracles. In this paper, we attempt to characterize how the access to an easier comparison oracle helps in improving the label and total query complexity. We show that the comparison oracle reduces the learning problem to that of learning a threshold function. We then present an algorithm that interactively queries the label and comparison oracles and we characterize its query complexity under Tsybakov and adversarial noise conditions for the comparison and labeling oracles. Our lower bounds show that our label and total query complexity is almost optimal."}
{"text": "  Multi-view feature has been proved to be very effective in many multimedia applications. However, the current back-end classifiers cannot make full use of such features. In this paper, we propose a method to model the multi-faceted information in the multi-view features explicitly and jointly. In our approach, the feature was modeled as a result derived by a generative multi-view (joint\\footnotemark[1]) Probability Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) model, which contains multiple kinds of latent variables. The usual PLDA model only considers one single label. However, in practical use, when using multi-task learned network as feature extractor, the extracted feature are always attached to several labels. This type of feature is called multi-view feature. With multi-view (joint) PLDA, we are able to explicitly build a model that can combine multiple heterogeneous information from the multi-view features. In verification step, we calculated the likelihood to describe whether the two features having consistent labels or not. This likelihood are used in the following decision-making. Experiments have been conducted on large scale verification task. On the public RSR2015 data corpus, the results showed that our approach can achieve 0.02\\% EER and 0.09\\% EER for impostor wrong and impostor correct cases respectively."}
{"text": "  Image clustering is one of the most important computer vision applications, which has been extensively studied in literature. However, current clustering methods mostly suffer from lack of efficiency and scalability when dealing with large-scale and high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new clustering model, called DEeP Embedded RegularIzed ClusTering (DEPICT), which efficiently maps data into a discriminative embedding subspace and precisely predicts cluster assignments. DEPICT generally consists of a multinomial logistic regression function stacked on top of a multi-layer convolutional autoencoder. We define a clustering objective function using relative entropy (KL divergence) minimization, regularized by a prior for the frequency of cluster assignments. An alternating strategy is then derived to optimize the objective by updating parameters and estimating cluster assignments. Furthermore, we employ the reconstruction loss functions in our autoencoder, as a data-dependent regularization term, to prevent the deep embedding function from overfitting. In order to benefit from end-to-end optimization and eliminate the necessity for layer-wise pretraining, we introduce a joint learning framework to minimize the unified clustering and reconstruction loss functions together and train all network layers simultaneously. Experimental results indicate the superiority and faster running time of DEPICT in real-world clustering tasks, where no labeled data is available for hyper-parameter tuning."}
{"text": "  Two of the leading approaches for model-free reinforcement learning are policy gradient methods and $Q$-learning methods. $Q$-learning methods can be effective and sample-efficient when they work, however, it is not well-understood why they work, since empirically, the $Q$-values they estimate are very inaccurate. A partial explanation may be that $Q$-learning methods are secretly implementing policy gradient updates: we show that there is a precise equivalence between $Q$-learning and policy gradient methods in the setting of entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, that \"soft\" (entropy-regularized) $Q$-learning is exactly equivalent to a policy gradient method. We also point out a connection between $Q$-learning methods and natural policy gradient methods. Experimentally, we explore the entropy-regularized versions of $Q$-learning and policy gradients, and we find them to perform as well as (or slightly better than) the standard variants on the Atari benchmark. We also show that the equivalence holds in practical settings by constructing a $Q$-learning method that closely matches the learning dynamics of A3C without using a target network or $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration schedule."}
{"text": "  We propose Batch-Expansion Training (BET), a framework for running a batch optimizer on a gradually expanding dataset. As opposed to stochastic approaches, batches do not need to be resampled i.i.d. at every iteration, thus making BET more resource efficient in a distributed setting, and when disk-access is constrained. Moreover, BET can be easily paired with most batch optimizers, does not require any parameter-tuning, and compares favorably to existing stochastic and batch methods. We show that when the batch size grows exponentially with the number of outer iterations, BET achieves optimal $O(1/\\epsilon)$ data-access convergence rate for strongly convex objectives. Experiments in parallel and distributed settings show that BET performs better than standard batch and stochastic approaches."}
{"text": "  Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric function estimators. However, their applications are largely limited by the expensive computational cost of the inference procedures. Existing stochastic or distributed synchronous variational inferences, although have alleviated this issue by scaling up GPs to millions of samples, are still far from satisfactory for real-world large applications, where the data sizes are often orders of magnitudes larger, say, billions. To solve this problem, we propose ADVGP, the first Asynchronous Distributed Variational Gaussian Process inference for regression, on the recent large-scale machine learning platform, PARAMETERSERVER. ADVGP uses a novel, flexible variational framework based on a weight space augmentation, and implements the highly efficient, asynchronous proximal gradient optimization. While maintaining comparable or better predictive performance, ADVGP greatly improves upon the efficiency of the existing variational methods. With ADVGP, we effortlessly scale up GP regression to a real-world application with billions of samples and demonstrate an excellent, superior prediction accuracy to the popular linear models."}
{"text": "  Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a variation of traditional supervised learning problems where data (referred to as bags) are composed of sub-elements (referred to as instances) and only bag labels are available. MIL has a variety of applications such as content-based image retrieval, text categorization and medical diagnosis. Most of the previous work for MIL assume that the training bags are fully labeled. However, it is often difficult to obtain an enough number of labeled bags in practical situations, while many unlabeled bags are available. A learning framework called PU learning (positive and unlabeled learning) can address this problem. In this paper, we propose a convex PU learning method to solve an MIL problem. We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves better performance with significantly lower computational costs than an existing method for PU-MIL."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of online learning in misspecified linear stochastic multi-armed bandit problems. Regret guarantees for state-of-the-art linear bandit algorithms such as Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) hold under the assumption that the arms expected rewards are perfectly linear in their features. It is, however, of interest to investigate the impact of potential misspecification in linear bandit models, where the expected rewards are perturbed away from the linear subspace determined by the arms features. Although OFUL has recently been shown to be robust to relatively small deviations from linearity, we show that any linear bandit algorithm that enjoys optimal regret performance in the perfectly linear setting (e.g., OFUL) must suffer linear regret under a sparse additive perturbation of the linear model. In an attempt to overcome this negative result, we define a natural class of bandit models characterized by a non-sparse deviation from linearity. We argue that the OFUL algorithm can fail to achieve sublinear regret even under models that have non-sparse deviation.We finally develop a novel bandit algorithm, comprising a hypothesis test for linearity followed by a decision to use either the OFUL or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. For perfectly linear bandit models, the algorithm provably exhibits OFULs favorable regret performance, while for misspecified models satisfying the non-sparse deviation property, the algorithm avoids the linear regret phenomenon and falls back on UCBs sublinear regret scaling. Numerical experiments on synthetic data, and on recommendation data from the public Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge dataset, empirically support our findings."}
{"text": "  In this paper, we propose an efficient vehicle trajectory prediction framework based on recurrent neural network. Basically, the characteristic of the vehicle's trajectory is different from that of regular moving objects since it is affected by various latent factors including road structure, traffic rules, and driver's intention. Previous state of the art approaches use sophisticated vehicle behavior model describing these factors and derive the complex trajectory prediction algorithm, which requires a system designer to conduct intensive model optimization for practical use. Our approach is data-driven and simple to use in that it learns complex behavior of the vehicles from the massive amount of trajectory data through deep neural network model. The proposed trajectory prediction method employs the recurrent neural network called long short-term memory (LSTM) to analyze the temporal behavior and predict the future coordinate of the surrounding vehicles. The proposed scheme feeds the sequence of vehicles' coordinates obtained from sensor measurements to the LSTM and produces the probabilistic information on the future location of the vehicles over occupancy grid map. The experiments conducted using the data collected from highway driving show that the proposed method can produce reasonably good estimate of future trajectory."}
{"text": "  We define the notion of a well-clusterable data set combining the point of view of the objective of $k$-means clustering algorithm (minimising the centric spread of data elements) and common sense (clusters shall be separated by gaps). We identify conditions under which the optimum of $k$-means objective coincides with a clustering under which the data is separated by predefined gaps.   We investigate two cases: when the whole clusters are separated by some gap and when only the cores of the clusters meet some separation condition.   We overcome a major obstacle in using clusterability criteria due to the fact that known approaches to clusterability checking had the disadvantage that they are related to the optimal clustering which is NP hard to identify.   Compared to other approaches to clusterability, the novelty consists in the possibility of an a posteriori (after running $k$-means) check if the data set is well-clusterable or not. As the $k$-means algorithm applied for this purpose has polynomial complexity so does therefore the appropriate check. Additionally, if $k$-means++ fails to identify a clustering that meets clusterability criteria, with high probability the data is not well-clusterable."}
{"text": "  We consider the problem of estimating a consensus community structure by combining information from multiple layers of a multi-layer network using methods based on the spectral clustering or a low-rank matrix factorization. As a general theme, these \"intermediate fusion\" methods involve obtaining a low column rank matrix by optimizing an objective function and then using the columns of the matrix for clustering. However, the theoretical properties of these methods remain largely unexplored. In the absence of statistical guarantees on the objective functions, it is difficult to determine if the algorithms optimizing the objectives will return good community structures. We investigate the consistency properties of the global optimizer of some of these objective functions under the multi-layer stochastic blockmodel. For this purpose, we derive several new asymptotic results showing consistency of the intermediate fusion techniques along with the spectral clustering of mean adjacency matrix under a high dimensional setup, where the number of nodes, the number of layers and the number of communities of the multi-layer graph grow. Our numerical study shows that the intermediate fusion techniques outperform late fusion methods, namely spectral clustering on aggregate spectral kernel and module allegiance matrix in sparse networks, while they outperform the spectral clustering of mean adjacency matrix in multi-layer networks that contain layers with both homophilic and heterophilic communities."}
{"text": "  Exponential Linear Units (ELUs) are a useful rectifier for constructing deep learning architectures, as they may speed up and otherwise improve learning by virtue of not have vanishing gradients and by having mean activations near zero. However, the ELU activation as parametrized in [1] is not continuously differentiable with respect to its input when the shape parameter alpha is not equal to 1. We present an alternative parametrization which is C1 continuous for all values of alpha, making the rectifier easier to reason about and making alpha easier to tune. This alternative parametrization has several other useful properties that the original parametrization of ELU does not: 1) its derivative with respect to x is bounded, 2) it contains both the linear transfer function and ReLU as special cases, and 3) it is scale-similar with respect to alpha."}
{"text": "  Given recent deep learning results that demonstrate the ability to effectively optimize high-dimensional non-convex functions with gradient descent optimization on GPUs, we ask in this paper whether symbolic gradient optimization tools such as Tensorflow can be effective for planning in hybrid (mixed discrete and continuous) nonlinear domains with high dimensional state and action spaces? To this end, we demonstrate that hybrid planning with Tensorflow and RMSProp gradient descent is competitive with mixed integer linear program (MILP) based optimization on piecewise linear planning domains (where we can compute optimal solutions) and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art interior point methods for nonlinear planning domains. Furthermore, we remark that Tensorflow is highly scalable, converging to a strong plan on a large-scale concurrent domain with a total of 576,000 continuous action parameters distributed over a horizon of 96 time steps and 100 parallel instances in only 4 minutes. We provide a number of insights that clarify such strong performance including observations that despite long horizons, RMSProp avoids both the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. Together these results suggest a new frontier for highly scalable planning in nonlinear hybrid domains by leveraging GPUs and the power of recent advances in gradient descent with highly optimized toolkits like Tensorflow."}
{"text": "  Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that iteratively transports a set of particles to approximate given distributions, based on an efficient gradient-based update that guarantees to optimally decrease the KL divergence within a function space. This paper develops the first theoretical analysis on SVGD, discussing its weak convergence properties and showing that its asymptotic behavior is captured by a gradient flow of the KL divergence functional under a new metric structure induced by Stein operator. We also provide a number of results on Stein operator and Stein's identity using the notion of weak derivative, including a new proof of the distinguishability of Stein discrepancy under weak conditions."}
{"text": "  The current work characterizes the users of a VoD streaming space through user-personas based on a tenure timeline and temporal behavioral features in the absence of explicit user profiles. A combination of tenure timeline and temporal characteristics caters to business needs of understanding the evolution and phases of user behavior as their accounts age. The personas constructed in this work successfully represent both dominant and niche characterizations while providing insightful maturation of user behavior in the system. The two major highlights of our personas are demonstration of stability along tenure timelines on a population level, while exhibiting interesting migrations between labels on an individual granularity and clear interpretability of user labels. Finally, we show a trade-off between an indispensable trio of guarantees, relevance-scalability-interpretability by using summary information from personas in a CTR (Click through rate) predictive model. The proposed method of uncovering latent personas, consequent insights from these and application of information from personas to predictive models are broadly applicable to other streaming based products."}
{"text": "  Various modifications of decision trees have been extensively used during the past years due to their high efficiency and interpretability. Tree node splitting based on relevant feature selection is a key step of decision tree learning, at the same time being their major shortcoming: the recursive nodes partitioning leads to geometric reduction of data quantity in the leaf nodes, which causes an excessive model complexity and data overfitting. In this paper, we present a novel architecture - a Decision Stream, - aimed to overcome this problem. Instead of building a tree structure during the learning process, we propose merging nodes from different branches based on their similarity that is estimated with two-sample test statistics, which leads to generation of a deep directed acyclic graph of decision rules that can consist of hundreds of levels. To evaluate the proposed solution, we test it on several common machine learning problems - credit scoring, twitter sentiment analysis, aircraft flight control, MNIST and CIFAR image classification, synthetic data classification and regression. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the standard decision tree learning methods on both regression and classification tasks, yielding a prediction error decrease up to 35%."}
{"text": "  Performance and high availability have become increasingly important drivers, amongst other drivers, for user retention in the context of web services such as social networks, and web search. Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services, with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of anomalies is non-trivial.   Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection, existing techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data, owing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data.   To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques employ statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system metrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal components of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical metrics -- median and median absolute deviation (MAD) -- to accurately detect anomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes.   We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different perspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning. In particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision, Recall, and F-measure in each case."}
{"text": "  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data is widely-used for early detection of diseases. Classical LDA for EHR data classification, however, suffers from two handicaps: the ill-posed estimation of LDA parameters (e.g., covariance matrix), and the \"linear inseparability\" of EHR data. To handle these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel classifier FWDA -- Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, that makes predictions in an ensemble way. Specifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution of inverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from the training data, then \"weighted-averages\" the classification results of multiple LDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via a Bayesian Voting scheme. The weights for voting are optimally updated to adapt each new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoretical analysis indicates that FWDA possesses a fast convergence rate and a robust performance on high dimensional data. Extensive experiments on large-scale EHR dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin."}
{"text": "  In this study, we introduce an ensemble-based approach for online machine learning. The ensemble of base classifiers in our approach is obtained by learning Naive Bayes classifiers on different training sets which are generated by projecting the original training set to lower dimensional space. We propose a mechanism to learn sequences of data using data chunks paradigm. The experiments conducted on a number of UCI datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than some well-known online learning algorithms."}
{"text": "  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) recently emerged as one of the most competitive approaches for learning in sequential decision making problems with fully observable environments, e.g., computer Go. However, very little work has been done in deep RL to handle partially observable environments. We propose a new architecture called Action-specific Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADRQN) to enhance learning performance in partially observable domains. Actions are encoded by a fully connected layer and coupled with a convolutional observation to form an action-observation pair. The time series of action-observation pairs are then integrated by an LSTM layer that learns latent states based on which a fully connected layer computes Q-values as in conventional Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new architecture in several partially observable domains, including flickering Atari games."}
{"text": "  In recent years, deep learning based on artificial neural network (ANN) has achieved great success in pattern recognition. However, there is no clear understanding of such neural computational models. In this paper, we try to unravel \"black-box\" structure of Ann model from network flow. Specifically, we consider the feed forward Ann as a network flow model, which consists of many directional class-pathways. Each class-pathway encodes one class. The class-pathway of a class is obtained by connecting the activated neural nodes in each layer from input to output, where activation value of neural node (node-value) is defined by the weights of each layer in a trained ANN-classifier. From the perspective of the class-pathway, training an ANN-classifier can be regarded as the formulation process of class-pathways of different classes. By analyzing the the distances of each two class-pathways in a trained ANN-classifiers, we try to answer the questions, why the classifier performs so? At last, from the neural encodes view, we define the importance of each neural node through the class-pathways, which is helpful to optimize the structure of a classifier. Experiments for two types of ANN model including multi-layer MLP and CNN verify that the network flow based on class-pathway is a reasonable explanation for ANN models."}
{"text": "  We give convergence guarantees for estimating the coefficients of a symmetric mixture of two linear regressions by expectation maximization (EM). In particular, we show that the empirical EM iterates converge to the target parameter vector at the parametric rate, provided the algorithm is initialized in an unbounded cone. In particular, if the initial guess has a sufficiently large cosine angle with the target parameter vector, a sample-splitting version of the EM algorithm converges to the true coefficient vector with high probability. Interestingly, our analysis borrows from tools used in the problem of estimating the centers of a symmetric mixture of two Gaussians by EM. We also show that the population EM operator for mixtures of two regressions is anti-contractive from the target parameter vector if the cosine angle between the input vector and the target parameter vector is too small, thereby establishing the necessity of our conic condition. Finally, we give empirical evidence supporting this theoretical observation, which suggests that the sample based EM algorithm performs poorly when initial guesses are drawn accordingly. Our simulation study also suggests that the EM algorithm performs well even under model misspecification (i.e., when the covariate and error distributions violate the model assumptions)."}
{"text": "  Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a key role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicity, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. In various types of chemical analyses, computational approaches are often required due to the amount of data that needs to be handled. The recent remarkable growth and outstanding performance of deep learning have attracted considerable research attention. However,even in state-of-the-art drug analysis methods, deep learning continues to be used only as a classifier, although deep learning is capable of not only simple classification but also automated feature extraction. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end learning method for CCI, named DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the chemical structure, instead of learning from crafted features. To discover hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous interaction, we apply model sharing and hidden representation merging techniques. The performance of DeepCCI was compared with a plain deep classifier and conventional machine learning methods. The proposed DeepCCI showed the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition, the commutative property was experimentally validated. The automatically extracted features through end-to-end SMILES learning alleviates the significant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected to improve prediction performance, in drug analyses."}

{"text": "  Daytime hypoglycemia should be accurately predicted to achieve normoglycemia and to avoid disastrous situations. Hypoglycemia, an abnormally low blood glucose level, is divided into daytime hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Many studies of hypoglycemia prevention deal with nocturnal hypoglycemia. In this paper, we propose new predictor variables to predict daytime hypoglycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. We apply classification and regression tree (CART) as a prediction method. The independent variables of our prediction model are the rate of decrease from a peak and absolute level of the BG at the decision point. The evaluation results showed that our model was able to detect almost 80% of hypoglycemic events 15 min in advance, which was higher than the existing methods with similar conditions. The proposed method might achieve a real-time prediction as well as can be embedded into BG monitoring device."}
{"text": "  A proper initialization of the weights in a neural network is critical to its convergence. Current insights into weight initialization come primarily from linear activation functions. In this paper, I develop a theory for weight initializations with non-linear activations. First, I derive a general weight initialization strategy for any neural network using activation functions differentiable at 0. Next, I derive the weight initialization strategy for the Rectified Linear Unit (RELU), and provide theoretical insights into why the Xavier initialization is a poor choice with RELU activations. My analysis provides a clear demonstration of the role of non-linearities in determining the proper weight initializations."}
{"text": "  Recent advances in combining deep neural network architectures with reinforcement learning techniques have shown promising potential results in solving complex control problems with high dimensional state and action spaces. Inspired by these successes, in this paper, we build two kinds of reinforcement learning algorithms: deep policy-gradient and value-function based agents which can predict the best possible traffic signal for a traffic intersection. At each time step, these adaptive traffic light control agents receive a snapshot of the current state of a graphical traffic simulator and produce control signals. The policy-gradient based agent maps its observation directly to the control signal, however the value-function based agent first estimates values for all legal control signals. The agent then selects the optimal control action with the highest value. Our methods show promising results in a traffic network simulated in the SUMO traffic simulator, without suffering from instability issues during the training process."}
{"text": "  The literature on bandit learning and regret analysis has focused on contexts where the goal is to converge on an optimal action in a manner that limits exploration costs. One shortcoming imposed by this orientation is that it does not treat time preference in a coherent manner. Time preference plays an important role when the optimal action is costly to learn relative to near-optimal actions. This limitation has not only restricted the relevance of theoretical results but has also influenced the design of algorithms. Indeed, popular approaches such as Thompson sampling and UCB can fare poorly in such situations. In this paper, we consider discounted rather than cumulative regret, where a discount factor encodes time preference. We propose satisficing Thompson sampling -- a variation of Thompson sampling -- and establish a strong discounted regret bound for this new algorithm."}
{"text": "  Sales forecasting plays a prominent role in business planning and business strategy. The value and importance of advance information is a cornerstone of planning activity, and a well-set forecast goal can guide sale-force more efficiently. In this paper CPU sales forecasting of Intel Corporation, a multinational semiconductor industry, was considered. Past sale, future booking, exchange rates, Gross domestic product (GDP) forecasting, seasonality and other indicators were innovatively incorporated into the quantitative modeling. Benefit from the recent advances in computation power and software development, millions of models built upon multiple regressions, time series analysis, random forest and boosting tree were executed in parallel. The models with smaller validation errors were selected to form the ensemble model. To better capture the distinct characteristics, forecasting models were implemented at lead time and lines of business level. The moving windows validation process automatically selected the models which closely represent current market condition. The weekly cadence forecasting schema allowed the model to response effectively to market fluctuation. Generic variable importance analysis was also developed to increase the model interpretability. Rather than assuming fixed distribution, this non-parametric permutation variable importance analysis provided a general framework across methods to evaluate the variable importance. This variable importance framework can further extend to classification problem by modifying the mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) into misclassify error.

{"text": "  We discuss several modifications and extensions over the previous proposed Cnvlutin (CNV) accelerator for convolutional and fully-connected layers of Deep Learning Network. We first describe different encodings of the activations that are deemed ineffectual. The encodings have different memory overhead and energy characteristics. We propose using a level of indirection when accessing activations from memory to reduce their memory footprint by storing only the effectual activations. We also present a modified organization that detects the activations that are deemed as ineffectual while fetching them from memory. This is different than the original design that instead detected them at the output of the preceding layer. Finally, we present an extended CNV that can also skip ineffectual weights."}

We further present efficient algorithms based on an approximation of the competitor automaton, in particular n-gram models obtained by minimizing the \\infty-R\\'{e}nyi divergence, and present an extensive study of the approximation properties of such models.

{"text": "  The dueling bandits problem is an online learning framework for learning from pairwise preference feedback, and is particularly well-suited for modeling settings that elicit subjective or implicit human feedback. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-dueling bandits with dependent arms, which extends the original dueling bandits setting by simultaneously dueling multiple arms as well as modeling dependencies between arms. These extensions capture key characteristics found in many real-world applications, and allow for the opportunity to develop significantly more efficient algorithms than were possible in the original setting. We propose the \\selfsparring algorithm, which reduces the multi-dueling bandits problem to a conventional bandit setting that can be solved using a stochastic bandit algorithm such as Thompson Sampling, and can naturally model dependencies using a Gaussian process prior. We present a no-regret analysis for multi-dueling setting, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm empirically on a wide range of simulation settings."}

The TWSVM learns two non-parallel classifying hyperplanes by solving a couple of smaller sized problems. However, it is unsuitable for large datasets, as it involves matrix operations. In this paper, we discuss a Twin Neural Network (Twin NN) architecture for learning from large unbalanced datasets. The Twin NN also learns an optimal feature map, allowing for better discrimination between classes. We also present an extension of this network architecture for multiclass datasets. Results presented in the paper demonstrate that the Twin NN generalizes well and scales well on large unbalanced datasets."}
{"text": "  As the emergence and the thriving development of social networks, a huge number of short texts are accumulated and need to be processed. Inferring latent topics of collected short texts is useful for understanding its hidden structure and predicting new contents. Unlike conventional topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a biterm topic model (BTM) was recently proposed for short texts to overcome the sparseness of document-level word co-occurrences by directly modeling the generation process of word pairs. Stochastic inference algorithms based on collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) and collapsed variational inference have been proposed for BTM. However, they either require large computational complexity, or rely on very crude estimation. In this work, we develop a stochastic divergence minimization inference algorithm for BTM to estimate latent topics more accurately in a scalable way. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared with existing inference algorithms."}
{"text": "  The paper addresses the simultneous determination of goup-sparse loadings by block optimization, and the correlated problem of defining explained variance for a set of non orthogonal components. We give in both cases a comprehensive mathematical presentation of the problem, which leads to propose i) a new formulation/algorithm for group-sparse block PCA and ii) a framework for the definition of explained variance with the analysis of five definitions. The numerical results i) confirm the superiority of block optimization over deflation for the determination of group-sparse loadings, and the importance of group information when available, and ii) show that ranking of algorithms according to explained variance is essentially independant of the definition of explained variance. These results lead to propose a new optimal variance as the definition of choice for explained variance."}
{"text": "  Consider two networks on overlapping, non-identical vertex sets. Given vertices of interest in the first network, we seek to identify the corresponding vertices, if any exist, in the second network. While in moderately sized networks graph matching methods can be applied directly to recover the missing correspondences, herein we present a principled methodology appropriate for situations in which the networks are too large for brute-force graph matching. Our methodology identifies vertices in a local neighborhood of the vertices of interest in the first network that have verifiable corresponding vertices in the second network. Leveraging these known correspondences, referred to as seeds, we match the induced subgraphs in each network generated by the neighborhoods of these verified seeds, and rank the vertices of the second network in terms of the most likely matches to the original vertices of interest. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology through simulations and real data examples."}
{"text": "  Multi-view high-dimensional data become increasingly popular in the big data era. Feature selection is a useful technique for alleviating the curse of dimensionality in multi-view learning. In this paper, we study unsupervised feature selection for multi-view data, as class labels are usually expensive to obtain. Traditional feature selection methods are mostly designed for single-view data and cannot fully exploit the rich information from multi-view data. Existing multi-view feature selection methods are usually based on noisy cluster labels which might not preserve sufficient information from multi-view data. To better utilize multi-view information, we propose a method, CDMA-FS, to select features for each view by performing alignment on a cross diffused matrix. We formulate it as a constrained optimization problem and solve it using Quasi-Newton based method. Experiments results on four real-world datasets show that the proposed method is more effective than the state-of-the-art methods in multi-view setting."}
{"text": "  Incomplete data are often represented as vectors with filled missing attributes joined with flag vectors indicating missing components. In this paper we generalize this approach and represent incomplete data as pointed affine subspaces. This allows to perform various affine transformations of data, as whitening or dimensionality reduction. We embed such generalized missing data into a vector space by mapping pointed affine subspace (generalized missing data point) to a vector containing imputed values joined with a corresponding projection matrix. Such an operation preserves the scalar product of the embedding defined for flag vectors and allows to input transformed incomplete data to typical classification methods."}
{"text": "  We consider a class of misspecified dynamical models where the governing term is only approximately known. Under the assumption that observations of the system's evolution are accessible for various initial conditions, our goal is to infer a non-parametric correction to the misspecified driving term such as to faithfully represent the system dynamics and devise system evolution predictions for unobserved initial conditions.   We model the unknown correction term as a Gaussian Process and analyze the problem of efficient experimental design to find an optimal correction term under constraints such as a limited experimental budget. We suggest a novel formulation for experimental design for this Gaussian Process and show that approximately optimal (up to a constant factor) designs may be efficiently derived by utilizing results from the literature on submodular optimization. Our numerical experiments exemplify the effectiveness of these techniques."}
{"text": "  We consider a sequence of repeated prediction games and formally pass to the limit. The supersolutions of the resulting non-linear parabolic partial differential equation are closely related to the potential functions in the sense of N.\\,Cesa-Bianci, G.\\,Lugosi (2003). Any such supersolution gives an upper bound for forecaster's regret and suggests a potential-based prediction strategy, satisfying the Blackwell condition. A conventional upper bound for the worst-case regret is justified by a simple verification argument."}
{"text": "  Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step for pattern recognition and data mining tasks to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a traditional technique for unsupervised dimensionality reduction, which is often employed to seek a projection to best represent the data in a least-squares sense, but if the original data is nonlinear structure, the performance of PCA will quickly drop. An supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) seeks for an embedding transformation, which can work well with Gaussian distribution data or single-modal data, but for non-Gaussian distribution data or multimodal data, it gives undesired results. What is worse, the dimension of LDA cannot be more than the number of classes. In order to solve these issues, Local shrunk discriminant analysis (LSDA) is proposed in this work to process the non-Gaussian distribution data or multimodal data, which not only incorporate both the linear and nonlinear structures of original data, but also learn the pattern shrinking to make the data more flexible to fit the manifold structure. Further, LSDA has more strong generalization performance, whose objective function will become local LDA and traditional LDA when different extreme parameters are utilized respectively. What is more, a new efficient optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the non-convex objective function with low computational cost. Compared with other related approaches, such as PCA, LDA and local LDA, the proposed method can derive a subspace which is more suitable for non-Gaussian distribution and real data. Promising experimental results on different kinds of data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "  This paper aims at formulating the issue of ranking multivariate unlabeled observations depending on their degree of abnormality as an unsupervised statistical learning task. In the 1-d situation, this problem is usually tackled by means of tail estimation techniques: univariate observations are viewed as all the more `abnormal' as they are located far in the tail(s) of the underlying probability distribution. It would be desirable as well to dispose of a scalar valued `scoring' function allowing for comparing the degree of abnormality of multivariate observations. Here we formulate the issue of scoring anomalies as a M-estimation problem by means of a novel functional performance criterion, referred to as the Mass Volume curve (MV curve in short), whose optimal elements are strictly increasing transforms of the density almost everywhere on the support of the density. We first study the statistical estimation of the MV curve of a given scoring function and we provide a strategy to build confidence regions using a smoothed bootstrap approach. Optimization of this functional criterion over the set of piecewise constant scoring functions is next tackled. This boils down to estimating a sequence of empirical minimum volume sets whose levels are chosen adaptively from the data, so as to adjust to the variations of the optimal MV curve, while controling the bias of its approximation by a stepwise curve. Generalization bounds are then established for the difference in sup norm between the MV curve of the empirical scoring function thus obtained and the optimal MV curve."}
{"text": "  Is it possible to perform linear regression on datasets whose labels are shuffled with respect to the inputs? We explore this question by proposing several estimators that recover the weights of a noisy linear model from labels that are shuffled by an unknown permutation. We show that the analog of the classical least-squares estimator produces inconsistent estimates in this setting, and introduce an estimator based on the self-moments of the input features and labels. We study the regimes in which each estimator excels, and generalize the estimators to the setting where partial ordering information is available in the form of experiments replicated independently. The result is a framework that enables robust inference, as we demonstrate by experiments on both synthetic and standard datasets, where we are able to recover approximate weights using only shuffled labels. Our work demonstrates that linear regression in the absence of complete ordering information is possible and can be of practical interest, particularly in experiments that characterize populations of particles, such as flow cytometry."}

{"text": "  Gaussian mixture model is very useful in many practical problems. Nevertheless, it cannot be directly generalized to non Euclidean spaces. To overcome this problem we present a spherical Gaussian-based clustering approach for partitioning data sets with respect to arbitrary dissimilarity measure. The proposed method is a combination of spherical Cross-Entropy Clustering with a generalized Wards approach. The algorithm finds the optimal number of clusters by automatically removing groups which carry no information. Moreover, it is scale invariant and allows for forming of spherically-shaped clusters of arbitrary sizes. In order to graphically represent and interpret the results the notion of Voronoi diagram was generalized to non Euclidean spaces and applied for introduced clustering method."}
{"text": "  An emerging way to deal with high-dimensional non-euclidean data is to assume that the underlying structure can be captured by a graph. Recently, ideas have begun to emerge related to the analysis of time-varying graph signals. This work aims to elevate the notion of joint harmonic analysis to a full-fledged framework denoted as Time-Vertex Signal Processing, that links together the time-domain signal processing techniques with the new tools of graph signal processing. This entails three main contributions: (a) We provide a formal motivation for harmonic time-vertex analysis as an analysis tool for the state evolution of simple Partial Differential Equations on graphs. (b) We improve the accuracy of joint filtering operators by up-to two orders of magnitude. (c) Using our joint filters, we construct time-vertex dictionaries analyzing the different scales and the local time-frequency content of a signal. The utility of our tools is illustrated in numerous applications and datasets, such as dynamic mesh denoising and classification, still-video inpainting, and source localization in seismic events. Our results suggest that joint analysis of time-vertex signals can bring benefits to regression and learning."}
{"text": "  Discovering relational structure between input features in sequence labeling models has shown to improve their accuracy in several problem settings. However, the search space of relational features is exponential in the number of basic input features. Consequently, approaches that learn relational features, tend to follow a greedy search strategy. In this paper, we study the possibility of optimally learning and applying discriminative relational features for sequence labeling. For learning features derived from inputs at a particular sequence position, we propose a Hierarchical Kernels-based approach (referred to as Hierarchical Kernel Learning for Structured Output Spaces - StructHKL). This approach optimally and efficiently explores the hierarchical structure of the feature space for problems with structured output spaces such as sequence labeling. Since the StructHKL approach has limitations in learning complex relational features derived from inputs at relative positions, we propose two solutions to learn relational features namely, (i) enumerating simple component features of complex relational features and discovering their compositions using StructHKL and (ii) leveraging relational kernels, that compute the similarity between instances implicitly, in the sequence labeling problem. We perform extensive empirical evaluation on publicly available datasets and record our observations on settings in which certain approaches are effective."}
{"text": "  Predicting large-scale transportation network traffic has become an important and challenging topic in recent decades. Inspired by the domain knowledge of motion prediction, in which the future motion of an object can be predicted based on previous scenes, we propose a network grid representation method that can retain the fine-scale structure of a transportation network. Network-wide traffic speeds are converted into a series of static images and input into a novel deep architecture, namely, spatiotemporal recurrent convolutional networks (SRCNs), for traffic forecasting. The proposed SRCNs inherit the advantages of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The spatial dependencies of network-wide traffic can be captured by DCNNs, and the temporal dynamics can be learned by LSTMs. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links demonstrates that SRCNs outperform other deep learning-based algorithms in both short-term and long-term traffic prediction."}
{"text": "  We argue that the optimization plays a crucial role in generalization of deep learning models through implicit regularization. We do this by demonstrating that generalization ability is not controlled by network size but rather by some other implicit control. We then demonstrate how changing the empirical optimization procedure can improve generalization, even if actual optimization quality is not affected. We do so by studying the geometry of the parameter space of deep networks, and devising an optimization algorithm attuned to this geometry."}
{"text": "  We present semiparametric spectral modeling of the complete larval Drosophila mushroom body connectome. Motivated by a thorough exploratory data analysis of the network via Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) in the adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) representation space, we introduce the latent structure model (LSM) for network modeling and inference. LSM is a generalization of the stochastic block model (SBM) and a special case of the random dot product graph (RDPG) latent position model, and is amenable to semiparametric GMM in the ASE representation space. The resulting connectome code derived via semiparametric GMM composed with ASE captures latent connectome structure and elucidates biologically relevant neuronal properties."}
{"text": "  A semi-parametric, non-linear regression model in the presence of latent variables is introduced. These latent variables can correspond to unmodeled phenomena or unmeasured agents in a complex networked system. This new formulation allows joint estimation of certain non-linearities in the system, the direct interactions between measured variables, and the effects of unmodeled elements on the observed system. The particular form of the model adopted is justified, and learning is posed as a regularized empirical risk minimization. This leads to classes of structured convex optimization problems with a \"sparse plus low-rank\" flavor. Relations between the proposed model and several common model paradigms, such as those of Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Vector Autoregression (VAR), are established. Particularly in the VAR setting, the low-rank contributions can come from broad trends exhibited in the time series. Details of the algorithm for learning the model are presented. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the model and the estimation algorithm on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "  The aim of the k-means is to minimize squared sum of Euclidean distance from the mean (SSEDM) of each cluster.

{"text": "  From the identification of a drawback in the Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm that limits its use in the scope of anomaly detection, we propose two extensions that allow to firstly overcome the previously mention limitation and secondly to provide it with some supervised learning capability. The resulting Hybrid Isolation Forest (HIF) that we propose is first evaluated on a synthetic dataset to analyze the effect of the new meta-parameters that are introduced and verify that the addressed limitation of the IF algorithm is effectively overcame. We hen compare the two algorithms on the ISCX benchmark dataset, in the context of a network intrusion detection application. Our experiments show that HIF outperforms IF, but also challenges the 1-class and 2-classes SVM baselines with computational efficiency."}
