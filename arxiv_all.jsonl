{"text": "The distance metric plays an important role in nearest neighbor (NN) classification. Usually the Euclidean distance metric is assumed or a Mahalanobis distance metric is optimized to improve the NN performance. In this paper, we study the problem of embedding arbitrary metric spaces into a Euclidean space with the goal to improve the accuracy of the NN classifier. We propose a solution by appealing to the framework of regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and prove a representer-like theorem for NN classification. The embedding function is then determined by solving a semidefinite program which has an interesting connection to the soft-margin linear binary support vector machine classifier. Although the main focus of this paper is to present a general, theoretical framework for metric embedding in a NN setting, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on some benchmark datasets and show that it performs better than the Mahalanobis metric learning algorithm in terms of leave-one-out and generalization errors."}
{"text": "Dendrograms used in data analysis are ultrametric spaces, hence objects of nonarchimedean geometry. It is known that there exist $p$-adic representation of dendrograms. Completed by a point at infinity, they can be viewed as subtrees of the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the $p$-adic projective line. The implications are that certain moduli spaces known in algebraic geometry are $p$-adic parameter spaces of (families of) dendrograms, and stochastic classification can also be handled within this framework. At the end, we calculate the topology of the hidden part of a dendrogram."}
{"text": "A conceptual framework for cluster analysis from the viewpoint of p-adic geometry is introduced by describing the space of all dendrograms for n datapoints and relating it to the moduli space of p-adic Riemannian spheres with punctures using a method recently applied by Murtagh (2004b). This method embeds a dendrogram as a subtree into the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the p-adic numbers, and goes back to Cornelissen et al. (2001) in p-adic geometry. After explaining the definitions, the concept of classifiers is discussed in the context of moduli spaces, and upper bounds for the number of hidden vertices in dendrograms are given."}
{"text": "We present and analyse three online algorithms for learning in discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and compare them with the Baldi-Chauvin Algorithm. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of generalisation error we draw learning curves in simplified situations. The performance for learning drifting concepts of one of the presented algorithms is analysed and compared with the Baldi-Chauvin algorithm in the same situations. A brief discussion about learning and symmetry breaking based on our results is also presented."}
{"text": "In recent years, kernel density estimation has been exploited by computer scientists to model machine learning problems. The kernel density estimation based approaches are of interest due to the low time complexity of either O(n) or O(n*log(n)) for constructing a classifier, where n is the number of sampling instances. Concerning design of kernel density estimators, one essential issue is how fast the pointwise mean square error (MSE) and/or the integrated mean square error (IMSE) diminish as the number of sampling instances increases. In this article, it is shown that with the proposed kernel function it is feasible to make the pointwise MSE of the density estimator converge at O(n^-2/3) regardless of the dimension of the vector space, provided that the probability density function at the point of interest meets certain conditions."}
{"text": "This thesis responds to the challenges of using a large number, such as thousands, of features in regression and classification problems.   There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and mixture models.   High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models.   We use both simulated data and real data to test our methods in both chapters."}
{"text": "Simulated annealing is a popular method for approaching the solution of a global optimization problem. Existing results on its performance apply to discrete combinatorial optimization where the optimization variables can assume only a finite set of possible values. We introduce a new general formulation of simulated annealing which allows one to guarantee finite-time performance in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. The results hold universally for any optimization problem on a bounded domain and establish a connection between simulated annealing and up-to-date theory of convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on continuous domains. This work is inspired by the concept of finite-time learning with known accuracy and confidence developed in statistical learning theory."}
{"text": "We present the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP), a stochastic process which assigns probability distributions to infinitely-deep, infinitely-branching trees. We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian nonparametric model of document collections. Specifically, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientific abstracts from several journals. This model exemplifies a recent trend in statistical machine learning--the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on flexible data structures."}
{"text": "We provide self-contained proof of a theorem relating probabilistic coherence of forecasts to their non-domination by rival forecasts with respect to any proper scoring rule. The theorem appears to be new but is closely related to results achieved by other investigators."}
{"text": "Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets."}
{"text": "We characterize and study variable importance (VIMP) and pairwise variable associations in binary regression trees. A key component involves the node mean squared error for a quantity we refer to as a maximal subtree. The theory naturally extends from single trees to ensembles of trees and applies to methods like random forests. This is useful because while importance values from random forests are used to screen variables, for example they are used to filter high throughput genomic data in Bioinformatics, very little theory exists about their properties."}
{"text": "This monograph deals with adaptive supervised classification, using tools borrowed from statistical mechanics and information theory, stemming from the PACBayesian approach pioneered by David McAllester and applied to a conception of statistical learning theory forged by Vladimir Vapnik. Using convex analysis on the set of posterior probability measures, we show how to get local measures of the complexity of the classification model involving the relative entropy of posterior distributions with respect to Gibbs posterior measures. We then discuss relative bounds, comparing the generalization error of two classification rules, showing how the margin assumption of Mammen and Tsybakov can be replaced with some empirical measure of the covariance structure of the classification model.We show how to associate to any posterior distribution an effective temperature relating it to the Gibbs prior distribution with the same level of expected error rate, and how to estimate this effective temperature from data, resulting in an estimator whose expected error rate converges according to the best possible power of the sample size adaptively under any margin and parametric complexity assumptions. We describe and study an alternative selection scheme based on relative bounds between estimators, and present a two step localization technique which can handle the selection of a parametric model from a family of those. We show how to extend systematically all the results obtained in the inductive setting to transductive learning, and use this to improve Vapnik's generalization bounds, extending them to the case when the sample is made of independent non-identically distributed pairs of patterns and labels. Finally we review briefly the construction of Support Vector Machines and show how to derive generalization bounds for them, measuring the complexity either through the number of support vectors or through the value of the transductive or inductive margin."}
{"text": "Dimensionality reduction is a topic of recent interest. In this paper, we present the classification constrained dimensionality reduction (CCDR) algorithm to account for label information. The algorithm can account for multiple classes as well as the semi-supervised setting. We present an out-of-sample expressions for both labeled and unlabeled data. For unlabeled data, we introduce a method of embedding a new point as preprocessing to a classifier. For labeled data, we introduce a method that improves the embedding during the training phase using the out-of-sample extension. We investigate classification performance using the CCDR algorithm on hyper-spectral satellite imagery data. We demonstrate the performance gain for both local and global classifiers and demonstrate a 10% improvement of the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm performance. We present a connection between intrinsic dimension estimation and the optimal embedding dimension obtained using the CCDR algorithm."}
{"text": "Being among the easiest ways to find meaningful structure from discrete data, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and related component models have been applied widely. They are simple, computationally fast and scalable, interpretable, and admit nonparametric priors. In the currently popular field of network modeling, relatively little work has taken uncertainty of data seriously in the Bayesian sense, and component models have been introduced to the field only recently, by treating each node as a bag of out-going links. We introduce an alternative, interaction component model for communities (ICMc), where the whole network is a bag of links, stemming from different components. The former finds both disassortative and assortative structure, while the alternative assumes assortativity and finds community-like structures like the earlier methods motivated by physics. With Dirichlet Process priors and an efficient implementation the models are highly scalable, as demonstrated with a social network from the Last.fm web site, with 670,000 nodes and 1.89 million links."}
{"text": "We propose to investigate test statistics for testing homogeneity in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Asymptotic null distributions under null hypothesis are derived, and consistency against fixed and local alternatives is assessed. Finally, experimental evidence of the performance of the proposed approach on both artificial data and a speaker verification task is provided."}
{"text": "When using the K-nearest neighbors method, one often ignores uncertainty in the choice of K. To account for such uncertainty, Holmes and Adams (2002) proposed a Bayesian framework for K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Their Bayesian KNN (BKNN) approach uses a pseudo-likelihood function, and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to draw posterior samples. Holmes and Adams (2002) focused on the performance of BKNN in terms of misclassification error but did not assess its ability to quantify uncertainty. We present some evidence to show that BKNN still significantly underestimates model uncertainty."}
{"text": "Flow cytometry is often used to characterize the malignant cells in leukemia and lymphoma patients, traced to the level of the individual cell. Typically, flow cytometric data analysis is performed through a series of 2-dimensional projections onto the axes of the data set. Through the years, clinicians have determined combinations of different fluorescent markers which generate relatively known expression patterns for specific subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma -- cancers of the hematopoietic system. By only viewing a series of 2-dimensional projections, the high-dimensional nature of the data is rarely exploited. In this paper we present a means of determining a low-dimensional projection which maintains the high-dimensional relationships (i.e. information) between differing oncological data sets. By using machine learning techniques, we allow clinicians to visualize data in a low dimension defined by a linear combination of all of the available markers, rather than just 2 at a time. This provides an aid in diagnosing similar forms of cancer, as well as a means for variable selection in exploratory flow cytometric research. We refer to our method as Information Preserving Component Analysis (IPCA)."}
{"text": "A simple and computationally efficient scheme for tree-structured vector quantization is presented. Unlike previous methods, its quantization error depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution, rather than the apparent dimension of the space in which the data happen to lie."}
{"text": "We analyze the performance of a class of manifold-learning algorithms that find their output by minimizing a quadratic form under some normalization constraints. This class consists of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Laplacian Eigenmap, Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE), and Diffusion maps. We present and prove conditions on the manifold that are necessary for the success of the algorithms. Both the finite sample case and the limit case are analyzed. We show that there are simple manifolds in which the necessary conditions are violated, and hence the algorithms cannot recover the underlying manifolds. Finally, we present numerical results that demonstrate our claims."}
{"text": "We present the Procrustes measure, a novel measure based on Procrustes rotation that enables quantitative comparison of the output of manifold-based embedding algorithms (such as LLE (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (Tenenbaum et al, 2000)). The measure also serves as a natural tool when choosing dimension-reduction parameters. We also present two novel dimension-reduction techniques that attempt to minimize the suggested measure, and compare the results of these techniques to the results of existing algorithms. Finally, we suggest a simple iterative method that can be used to improve the output of existing algorithms."}
{"text": "The problem of supervised classification (or discrimination) with functional data is considered, with a special interest on the popular k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. First, relying on a recent result by Cerou and Guyader (2006), we prove the consistency of the k-NN classifier for functional data whose distribution belongs to a broad family of Gaussian processes with triangular covariance functions. Second, on a more practical side, we check the behavior of the k-NN method when compared with a few other functional classifiers. This is carried out through a small simulation study and the analysis of several real functional data sets. While no global \"uniform\" winner emerges from such comparisons, the overall performance of the k-NN method, together with its sound intuitive motivation and relative simplicity, suggests that it could represent a reasonable benchmark for the classification problem with functional data."}
{"text": "We propose a new sparsity-smoothness penalty for high-dimensional generalized additive models. The combination of sparsity and smoothness is crucial for mathematical theory as well as performance for finite-sample data. We present a computationally efficient algorithm, with provable numerical convergence properties, for optimizing the penalized likelihood. Furthermore, we provide oracle results which yield asymptotic optimality of our estimator for high dimensional but sparse additive models. Finally, an adaptive version of our sparsity-smoothness penalized approach yields large additional performance gains."}
{"text": "The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the input. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and linear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional neighborhood representation."}
{"text": "We construct a framework for studying clustering algorithms, which includes two key ideas: persistence and functoriality. The first encodes the idea that the output of a clustering scheme should carry a multiresolution structure, the second the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme, stability and convergence are established."}
{"text": "We consider principal component analysis (PCA) in decomposable Gaussian graphical models. We exploit the prior information in these models in order to distribute its computation. For this purpose, we reformulate the problem in the sparse inverse covariance (concentration) domain and solve the global eigenvalue problem using a sequence of local eigenvalue problems in each of the cliques of the decomposable graph. We demonstrate the application of our methodology in the context of decentralized anomaly detection in the Abilene backbone network. Based on the topology of the network, we propose an approximate statistical graphical model and distribute the computation of PCA."}
{"text": "Many problems of low-level computer vision and image processing, such as denoising, deconvolution, tomographic reconstruction or super-resolution, can be addressed by maximizing the posterior distribution of a sparse linear model (SLM). We show how higher-order Bayesian decision-making problems, such as optimizing image acquisition in magnetic resonance scanners, can be addressed by querying the SLM posterior covariance, unrelated to the density's mode. We propose a scalable algorithmic framework, with which SLM posteriors over full, high-resolution images can be approximated for the first time, solving a variational optimization problem which is convex iff posterior mode finding is convex. These methods successfully drive the optimization of sampling trajectories for real-world magnetic resonance imaging through Bayesian experimental design, which has not been attempted before. Our methodology provides new insight into similarities and differences between sparse reconstruction and approximate Bayesian inference, and has important implications for compressive sensing of real-world images."}
{"text": "We present a new online boosting algorithm for adapting the weights of a boosted classifier, which yields a closer approximation to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm than previous online boosting algorithms. We also contribute a new way of deriving the online algorithm that ties together previous online boosting work. We assume that the weak hypotheses were selected beforehand, and only their weights are updated during online boosting. The update rule is derived by minimizing AdaBoost's loss when viewed in an incremental form. The equations show that optimization is computationally expensive. However, a fast online approximation is possible. We compare approximation error to batch AdaBoost on synthetic datasets and generalization error on face datasets and the MNIST dataset."}
{"text": "In this report, we derive a non-negative series expansion for the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between two probability distributions. This series expansion is shown to be useful for numerical calculations of the JSD, when the probability distributions are nearly equal, and for which, consequently, small numerical errors dominate evaluation."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of jointly estimating the parameters as well as the structure of binary valued Markov Random Fields, in contrast to earlier work that focus on one of the two problems. We formulate the problem as a maximization of $\\ell_1$-regularized surrogate likelihood that allows us to find a sparse solution. Our optimization technique efficiently incorporates the cutting-plane algorithm in order to obtain a tighter outer bound on the marginal polytope, which results in improvement of both parameter estimates and approximation to marginals. On synthetic data, we compare our algorithm on the two estimation tasks to the other existing methods. We analyze the method in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of dimensions $p$ is allowed to grow with the number of observations $n$. The rate of convergence of the estimate is demonstrated to depend explicitly on the sparsity of the underlying graph."}
{"text": "The most direct way to express arbitrary dependencies in datasets is to estimate the joint distribution and to apply afterwards the argmax-function to obtain the mode of the corresponding conditional distribution. This method is in practice difficult, because it requires a global optimization of a complicated function, the joint distribution by fixed input variables. This article proposes a method for finding global maxima if the joint distribution is modeled by a kernel density estimation. Some experiments show advantages and shortcomings of the resulting regression method in comparison to the standard Nadaraya-Watson regression technique, which approximates the optimum by the expectation value."}
{"text": "We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual information from small-sample data, and apply it to the problem of inferring high-dimensional gene association networks. Specifically, we develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator."}
{"text": "This paper examines from an experimental perspective random forests, the increasingly used statistical method for classification and regression problems introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001. It first aims at confirming, known but sparse, advice for using random forests and at proposing some complementary remarks for both standard problems as well as high dimensional ones for which the number of variables hugely exceeds the sample size. But the main contribution of this paper is twofold: to provide some insights about the behavior of the variable importance index based on random forests and in addition, to propose to investigate two classical issues of variable selection. The first one is to find important variables for interpretation and the second one is more restrictive and try to design a good prediction model. The strategy involves a ranking of explanatory variables using the random forests score of importance and a stepwise ascending variable introduction strategy."}
{"text": "Min-cut clustering, based on minimizing one of two heuristic cost-functions proposed by Shi and Malik, has spawned tremendous research, both analytic and algorithmic, in the graph partitioning and image segmentation communities over the last decade. It is however unclear if these heuristics can be derived from a more general principle facilitating generalization to new problem settings. Motivated by an existing graph partitioning framework, we derive relationships between optimizing relevance information, as defined in the Information Bottleneck method, and the regularized cut in a K-partitioned graph. For fast mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the location of random walkers on the graph. For graphs generated from a stochastic algorithm designed to model community structure, the optimal information theoretic partition and the optimal min-cut partition are shown to be the same with high probability."}
{"text": "Autoencoder neural network is implemented to estimate the missing data. Genetic algorithm is implemented for network optimization and estimating the missing data. Missing data is treated as Missing At Random mechanism by implementing maximum likelihood algorithm. The network performance is determined by calculating the mean square error of the network prediction. The network is further optimized by implementing Decision Forest. The impact of missing data is then investigated and decision forrests are found to improve the results."}
{"text": "We obtain an index of the complexity of a random sequence by allowing the role of the measure in classical probability theory to be played by a function we call the generating mechanism. Typically, this generating mechanism will be a finite automata. We generate a set of biased sequences by applying a finite state automata with a specified number, $m$, of states to the set of all binary sequences. Thus we can index the complexity of our random sequence by the number of states of the automata. We detail optimal algorithms to predict sequences generated in this way."}
{"text": "There has been an explosion of interest in statistical models for analyzing network data, and considerable interest in the class of exponential random graph (ERG) models, especially in connection with difficulties in computing maximum likelihood estimates. The issues associated with these difficulties relate to the broader structure of discrete exponential families. This paper re-examines the issues in two parts. First we consider the closure of $k$-dimensional exponential families of distribution with discrete base measure and polyhedral convex support $\\mathrm{P}$. We show that the normal fan of $\\mathrm{P}$ is a geometric object that plays a fundamental role in deriving the statistical and geometric properties of the corresponding extended exponential families. We discuss its relevance to maximum likelihood estimation, both from a theoretical and computational standpoint. Second, we apply our results to the analysis of ERG models. In particular, by means of a detailed example, we provide some characterization of the properties of ERG models, and, in particular, of certain behaviors of ERG models known as degeneracy."}
{"text": "This article introduces both a new algorithm for reconstructing epsilon-machines from data, as well as the decisional states. These are defined as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are thus the \"emerging\" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a change of decision. The new REMAPF algorithm estimates both the epsilon-machine and the decisional states from data. Application examples are given for hidden model reconstruction, cellular automata filtering, and edge detection in images."}
{"text": "The runtime for Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to compute the fit is quadratic in the number of examples. However, the necessity of obtaining sensitivity measures as degrees of freedom for model selection or confidence intervals for more detailed analysis requires cubic runtime, and thus constitutes a computational bottleneck in real-world data analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for KPLS which not only computes (a) the fit, but also (b) its approximate degrees of freedom and (c) error bars in quadratic runtime. The algorithm exploits a close connection between Kernel PLS and the Lanczos algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, and uses this approximation to compute the trace of powers of the kernel matrix in quadratic runtime."}
{"text": "We present the first tree-based regressor whose convergence rate depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the data, namely its Assouad dimension. The regressor uses the RPtree partitioning procedure, a simple randomized variant of k-d trees."}
{"text": "Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula--or \"nonparanormal\"--for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples."}
{"text": "Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate causal models in classical situations with fewer variables than observations (p<n, p: the number of variables and n: the number of observations). However, modern datasets including gene expression data need high-dimensional causal modeling in challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than observations (p>>n). In this paper, we propose a method to find exogenous variables in a linear non-Gaussian causal model, which requires much smaller sample sizes than conventional methods and works even when p>>n. The key idea is to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead of estimating the entire structure of the model. Exogenous variables work as triggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the causal mechanism. We present experiments with artificial data and real-world gene expression data to evaluate the method."}
{"text": "We consider the empirical risk minimization problem for linear supervised learning, with regularization by structured sparsity-inducing norms. These are defined as sums of Euclidean norms on certain subsets of variables, extending the usual $\\ell_1$-norm and the group $\\ell_1$-norm by allowing the subsets to overlap. This leads to a specific set of allowed nonzero patterns for the solutions of such problems. We first explore the relationship between the groups defining the norm and the resulting nonzero patterns, providing both forward and backward algorithms to go back and forth from groups to patterns. This allows the design of norms adapted to specific prior knowledge expressed in terms of nonzero patterns. We also present an efficient active set algorithm, and analyze the consistency of variable selection for least-squares linear regression in low and high-dimensional settings."}

{"text": "Variable selection for high-dimensional linear models has received a lot of attention lately, mostly in the context of l1-regularization. Part of the attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained, which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power, however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand, lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize. A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily to visualization and interpretation. The predictive power is maintained at least at the same level as the original tree ensemble. A key feature of the method is that, once a tree ensemble is fitted, no further tuning parameter needs to be selected. The empirical performance is demonstrated on a wide array of datasets."}
{"text": "Most accurate predictions are typically obtained by learning machines with complex feature spaces (as e.g. induced by kernels). Unfortunately, such decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in simulations."}
{"text": "Selecting important features in non-linear or kernel spaces is a difficult challenge in both classification and regression problems. When many of the features are irrelevant, kernel methods such as the support vector machine and kernel ridge regression can sometimes perform poorly. We propose weighting the features within a kernel with a sparse set of weights that are estimated in conjunction with the original classification or regression problem. The iterative algorithm, KNIFE, alternates between finding the coefficients of the original problem and finding the feature weights through kernel linearization. In addition, a slight modification of KNIFE yields an efficient algorithm for finding feature regularization paths, or the paths of each feature's weight. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of KNIFE for both kernel regression and support vector machines with a variety of kernels. Feature path realizations also reveal important non-linear correlations among features that prove useful in determining a subset of significant variables. Results on vowel recognition data, Parkinson's disease data, and microarray data are also given."}
{"text": "We introduce a new Bayesian model for hierarchical clustering based on a prior over trees called Kingman's coalescent. We develop novel greedy and sequential Monte Carlo inferences which operate in a bottom-up agglomerative fashion. We show experimentally the superiority of our algorithms over others, and demonstrate our approach in document clustering and phylolinguistics."}
{"text": "We describe a new method for visualizing topics, the distributions over terms that are automatically extracted from large text corpora using latent variable models. Our method finds significant $n$-grams related to a topic, which are then used to help understand and interpret the underlying distribution. Compared with the usual visualization, which simply lists the most probable topical terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better intuitive impression for what a topic is \"about.\" Our approach is based on a language model of arbitrary length expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based on nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We show that this method outperforms the more standard use of $\\chi^2$ and likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and news articles."}
{"text": "Network models have been popular for modeling and representing complex relationships and dependencies between observed variables. When data comes from a dynamic stochastic process, a single static network model cannot adequately capture transient dependencies, such as, gene regulatory dependencies throughout a developmental cycle of an organism. Kolar et al (2010b) proposed a method based on kernel-smoothing l1-penalized logistic regression for estimating time-varying networks from nodal observations collected from a time-series of observational data. In this paper, we establish conditions under which the proposed method consistently recovers the structure of a time-varying network. This work complements previous empirical findings by providing sound theoretical guarantees for the proposed estimation procedure. For completeness, we include numerical simulations in the paper."}
{"text": "We give improved constants for data dependent and variance sensitive confidence bounds, called empirical Bernstein bounds, and extend these inequalities to hold uniformly over classes of functionswhose growth function is polynomial in the sample size n. The bounds lead us to consider sample variance penalization, a novel learning method which takes into account the empirical variance of the loss function. We give conditions under which sample variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are situations in which the excess risk of our method is of order 1/n, while the excess risk of empirical risk minimization is of order 1/sqrt/{n}. We show some experimental results, which confirm the theory. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our results to sample compression schemes."}
{"text": "We discuss here the mean-field theory for a cellular automata model of meta-learning. The meta-learning is the process of combining outcomes of individual learning procedures in order to determine the final decision with higher accuracy than any single learning method. Our method is constructed from an ensemble of interacting, learning agents, that acquire and process incoming information using various types, or different versions of machine learning algorithms. The abstract learning space, where all agents are located, is constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents with random strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher level integration of information acquired from the independent learning trials. The final classification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the stationary state of the meta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet the minority clusters that share opposite classification outcome can be observed in the system. Therefore, the probability of selecting proper class for a given input data, can be estimated even without the prior knowledge of its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easily introduced into the system, even if learning agents are build from simple binary classification machine learning algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeing agents."}
{"text": "We investigate the role of the initialization for the stability of the k-means clustering algorithm. As opposed to other papers, we consider the actual k-means algorithm and do not ignore its property of getting stuck in local optima. We are interested in the actual clustering, not only in the costs of the solution. We analyze when different initializations lead to the same local optimum, and when they lead to different local optima. This enables us to prove that it is reasonable to select the number of clusters based on stability scores."}
{"text": "We introduce a new nearest-prototype classifier, the prototype vector machine (PVM). It arises from a combinatorial optimization problem which we cast as a variant of the set cover problem. We propose two algorithms for approximating its solution. The PVM selects a relatively small number of representative points which can then be used for classification. It contains 1-NN as a special case. The method is compatible with any dissimilarity measure, making it amenable to situations in which the data are not embedded in an underlying feature space or in which using a non-Euclidean metric is desirable. Indeed, we demonstrate on the much studied ZIP code data how the PVM can reap the benefits of a problem-specific metric. In this example, the PVM outperforms the highly successful 1-NN with tangent distance, and does so retaining fewer than half of the data points. This example highlights the strengths of the PVM in yielding a low-error, highly interpretable model. Additionally, we apply the PVM to a protein classification problem in which a kernel-based distance is used."}

{"text": "We present in this work a new family of kernels to compare positive measures on arbitrary spaces $\\Xcal$ endowed with a positive kernel $\\kappa$, which translates naturally into kernels between histograms or clouds of points. We first cover the case where $\\Xcal$ is Euclidian, and focus on kernels which take into account the variance matrix of the mixture of two measures to compute their similarity. The kernels we define are semigroup kernels in the sense that they only use the sum of two measures to compare them, and spectral in the sense that they only use the eigenspectrum of the variance matrix of this mixture. We show that such a family of kernels has close bonds with the laplace transforms of nonnegative-valued functions defined on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, and we present some closed formulas that can be derived as special cases of such integral expressions. By focusing further on functions which are invariant to the addition of a null eigenvalue to the spectrum of the variance matrix, we can define kernels between atomic measures on arbitrary spaces $\\Xcal$ endowed with a kernel $\\kappa$ by using directly the eigenvalues of the centered Gram matrix of the joined support of the compared measures. We provide explicit formulas suited for applications and present preliminary experiments to illustrate the interest of the approach."}
{"text": "We present an extension of sparse PCA, or sparse dictionary learning, where the sparsity patterns of all dictionary elements are structured and constrained to belong to a prespecified set of shapes. This \\emph{structured sparse PCA} is based on a structured regularization recently introduced by [1]. While classical sparse priors only deal with \\textit{cardinality}, the regularization we use encodes higher-order information about the data. We propose an efficient and simple optimization procedure to solve this problem. Experiments with two practical tasks, face recognition and the study of the dynamics of a protein complex, demonstrate the benefits of the proposed structured approach over unstructured approaches."}
{"text": "We describe a method for inferring linear causal relations among multi-dimensional variables. The idea is to use an asymmetry between the distributions of cause and effect that occurs if both the covariance matrix of the cause and the structure matrix mapping cause to the effect are independently chosen. The method works for both stochastic and deterministic causal relations, provided that the dimensionality is sufficiently high (in some experiments, 5 was enough). It is applicable to Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data."}
{"text": "This paper proposes an original approach to cluster multi-component data sets, including an estimation of the number of clusters. From the construction of a minimal spanning tree with Prim's algorithm, and the assumption that the vertices are approximately distributed according to a Poisson distribution, the number of clusters is estimated by thresholding the Prim's trajectory. The corresponding cluster centroids are then computed in order to initialize the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, also known as $K$-means, which allows to circumvent initialization problems. Some results are derived for evaluating the false positive rate of our cluster detection algorithm, with the help of approximations relevant in Euclidean spaces. Metrics used for measuring similarity between multi-dimensional data points are based on symmetrical divergences. The use of these informational divergences together with the proposed method leads to better results, compared to other clustering methods for the problem of astrophysical data processing. Some applications of this method in the multi/hyper-spectral imagery domain to a satellite view of Paris and to an image of the Mars planet are also presented. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of divergences in our problem, the method with informational divergence as similarity measure is compared with the same method using classical metrics. In the astrophysics application, we also compare the method with the spectral clustering algorithms."}
{"text": "We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM), a new method of nonparametric regression that accommodates continuous and categorical inputs, and responses that can be modeled by a generalized linear model. We prove conditions for the asymptotic unbiasedness of the DP-GLM regression mean function estimate. We also give examples for when those conditions hold, including models for compactly supported continuous distributions and a model with continuous covariates and categorical response. We empirically analyze the properties of the DP-GLM and why it provides better results than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We evaluate DP-GLM on several data sets, comparing it to modern methods of nonparametric regression like CART, Bayesian trees and Gaussian processes. Compared to existing techniques, the DP-GLM provides a single model (and corresponding inference algorithms) that performs well in many regression settings."}
{"text": "In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi--supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step. Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "Many inference problems involving questions of optimality ask for the maximum or the minimum of a finite set of unknown quantities. This technical report derives the first two posterior moments of the maximum of two correlated Gaussian variables and the first two posterior moments of the two generating variables (corresponding to Gaussian approximations minimizing relative entropy). It is shown how this can be used to build a heuristic approximation to the maximum relationship over a finite set of Gaussian variables, allowing approximate inference by Expectation Propagation on such quantities."}
{"text": "This paper reviews the functional aspects of statistical learning theory. The main point under consideration is the nature of the hypothesis set when no prior information is available but data. Within this framework we first discuss about the hypothesis set: it is a vectorial space, it is a set of pointwise defined functions, and the evaluation functional on this set is a continuous mapping. Based on these principles an original theory is developed generalizing the notion of reproduction kernel Hilbert space to non hilbertian sets. Then it is shown that the hypothesis set of any learning machine has to be a generalized reproducing set. Therefore, thanks to a general \"representer theorem\", the solution of the learning problem is still a linear combination of a kernel. Furthermore, a way to design these kernels is given. To illustrate this framework some examples of such reproducing sets and kernels are given."}
{"text": "The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle states that the optimal model for a given data set is that which compresses it best. Due to practial limitations the model can be restricted to a class such as linear regression models, which we address in this study. As in other formulations such as the LASSO and forward step-wise regression we are interested in sparsifying the feature set while preserving generalization ability. We derive a well-principled set of codes for both parameters and error residuals along with smooth approximations to lengths of these codes as to allow gradient descent optimization of description length, and go on to show that sparsification and feature selection using our approach is faster than the LASSO on several datasets from the UCI and StatLib repositories, with favorable generalization accuracy, while being fully automatic, requiring neither cross-validation nor tuning of regularization hyper-parameters, allowing even for a nonlinear expansion of the feature set followed by sparsification."}
{"text": "We propose a method to infer causal structures containing both discrete and continuous variables. The idea is to select causal hypotheses for which the conditional density of every variable, given its causes, becomes smooth. We define a family of smooth densities and conditional densities by second order exponential models, i.e., by maximizing conditional entropy subject to first and second statistical moments. If some of the variables take only values in proper subsets of R^n, these conditionals can induce different families of joint distributions even for Markov-equivalent graphs.   We consider the case of one binary and one real-valued variable where the method can distinguish between cause and effect. Using this example, we describe that sometimes a causal hypothesis must be rejected because P(effect|cause) and P(cause) share algorithmic information (which is untypical if they are chosen independently). This way, our method is in the same spirit as faithfulness-based causal inference because it also rejects non-generic mutual adjustments among DAG-parameters."}
{"text": "Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables from a finite sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently, methods using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of continuous variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest are discrete or even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the notion of additive noise models to these cases. We prove that whenever the joint distribution $\\prob^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g. $Y=f(X)+N, N \\independent X$, it does not admit the reversed model $X=g(Y)+\\tilde N, \\tilde N \\independent Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a generic way. Based on these deliberations we propose an efficient new algorithm that is able to distinguish between cause and effect for a finite sample of discrete variables. In an extensive experimental study we show that this algorithm works both on synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying driving forces from quickly varying nonstationary time series. We show here that it is possible for SFA to detect a component which is even slower than the driving force itself (e.g. the envelope of a modulated sine wave). It is shown that it depends on circumstances like the embedding dimension, the time series predictability, or the base frequency, whether the driving force itself or a slower subcomponent is detected. We observe a phase transition from one regime to the other and it is the purpose of this work to quantify the influence of various parameters on this phase transition. We conclude that what is percieved as slow by SFA varies and that a more or less fast switching from one regime to the other occurs, perhaps showing some similarity to human perception."}
{"text": "Recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different sparse approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies present naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a single output. We show experimental results with synthetic and real data, in particular, we show results in pollution prediction, school exams score prediction and gene expression data."}
{"text": "This survey is an introduction to positive definite kernels and the set of methods they have inspired in the machine learning literature, namely kernel methods.

We discuss at length the construction of kernel functions that take advantage of well-known statistical models. We provide an overview of numerous data-analysis methods which take advantage of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the idea of combining several kernels to improve the performance on certain tasks. We also provide a short cookbook of different kernels which are particularly useful for certain data-types such as images, graphs or speech segments."}
{"text": "This article addresses the modeling of reverberant recording environments in the context of under-determined convolutive blind source separation. We model the contribution of each source to all mixture channels in the time-frequency domain as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable whose covariance encodes the spatial characteristics of the source. We then consider four specific covariance models, including a full-rank unconstrained model. We derive a family of iterative expectationmaximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the parameters of each model and propose suitable procedures to initialize the parameters and to align the order of the estimated sources across all frequency bins based on their estimated directions of arrival (DOA). Experimental results over reverberant synthetic mixtures and live recordings of speech data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider the problem of \"hyper-sparse aggregation\". Namely, given a dictionary $F = \\{f_1, ..., f_M \\}$ of functions, we look for an optimal aggregation algorithm that writes $\\tilde f = \\sum_{j=1}^M \\theta_j f_j$ with as many zero coefficients $\\theta_j$ as possible. This problem is of particular interest when $F$ contains many irrelevant functions that should not appear in $\\tilde{f}$. We provide an exact oracle inequality for $\\tilde f$, where only two coefficients are non-zero, that entails $\\tilde f$ to be an optimal aggregation algorithm. Since selectors are suboptimal aggregation procedures, this proves that 2 is the minimal number of elements of $F$ required for the construction of an optimal aggregation procedures in every situations. A simulated example of this algorithm is proposed on a dictionary obtained using LARS, for the problem of selection of the regularization parameter of the LASSO. We also give an example of use of aggregation to achieve minimax adaptation over anisotropic Besov spaces, which was not previously known in minimax theory (in regression on a random design)."}
{"text": "We extend multi-way, multivariate ANOVA-type analysis to cases where one covariate is the view, with features of each view coming from different, high-dimensional domains. The different views are assumed to be connected by having paired samples; this is a common setup in recent bioinformatics experiments, of which we analyze metabolite profiles in different conditions (disease vs. control and treatment vs. untreated) in different tissues (views). We introduce a multi-way latent variable model for this new task, by extending the generative model of Bayesian canonical correlation analysis (CCA) both to take multi-way covariate information into account as population priors, and by reducing the dimensionality by an integrated factor analysis that assumes the metabolites to come in correlated groups."}
{"text": "Interest in multioutput kernel methods is increasing, whether under the guise of multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function over correlated output functions. One way of constructing such kernels is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence (2009) recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series."}
{"text": "We study losses for binary classification and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and ``classification calibrated'' losses. We also consider the question of the ``best'' surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of ``best'' and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of ``surrogate tuning''. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassification noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassification noise."}
{"text": "We provide yet another proof of the existence of calibrated forecasters; it has two merits. First, it is valid for an arbitrary finite number of outcomes. Second, it is short and simple and it follows from a direct application of Blackwell's approachability theorem to carefully chosen vector-valued payoff function and convex target set. Our proof captures the essence of existing proofs based on approachability (e.g., the proof by Foster, 1999 in case of binary outcomes) and highlights the intrinsic connection between approachability and calibration."}
{"text": "Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets."}
{"text": "We study graph estimation and density estimation in high dimensions, using a family of density estimators based on forest structured undirected graphical models. For density estimation, we do not assume the true distribution corresponds to a forest; rather, we form kernel density estimates of the bivariate and univariate marginals, and apply Kruskal's algorithm to estimate the optimal forest on held out data. We prove an oracle inequality on the excess risk of the resulting estimator relative to the risk of the best forest. For graph estimation, we consider the problem of estimating forests with restricted tree sizes. We prove that finding a maximum weight spanning forest with restricted tree size is NP-hard, and develop an approximation algorithm for this problem. Viewing the tree size as a complexity parameter, we then select a forest using data splitting, and prove bounds on excess risk and structure selection consistency of the procedure. Experiments with simulated data and microarray data indicate that the methods are a practical alternative to Gaussian graphical models."}
{"text": "We assume data independently sampled from a mixture distribution on the unit ball of the D-dimensional Euclidean space with K+1 components: the first component is a uniform distribution on that ball representing outliers and the other K components are uniform distributions along K d-dimensional linear subspaces restricted to that ball. We study both the simultaneous recovery of all K underlying subspaces and the recovery of the best l0 subspace (i.e., with largest number of points) by minimizing the lp-averaged distances of data points from d-dimensional subspaces of the D-dimensional space. Unlike other lp minimization problems, this minimization is non-convex for all p>0 and thus requires different methods for its analysis. We show that if 0<p <= 1, then both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace can be precisely recovered by lp minimization with overwhelming probability. This result extends to additive homoscedastic uniform noise around the subspaces (i.e., uniform distribution in a strip around them) and near recovery with an error proportional to the noise level. On the other hand, if K>1 and p>1, then we show that both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace cannot be recovered and even nearly recovered. Further relaxations are also discussed. We use the results of this paper for partially justifying recent effective algorithms for modeling data by mixtures of multiple subspaces as well as for discussing the effect of using variants of lp minimizations in RANSAC-type strategies for single subspace recovery."}
{"text": "Independent component analysis (ICA) aims at decomposing an observed random vector into statistically independent variables. Deflation-based implementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its variants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method for deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper. This simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of the kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of the contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed algebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical benefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and complex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of prewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local extrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational cost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for short data records. These features are demonstrated by a comparative numerical analysis on synthetic data. RobustICA's capabilities in processing real-world data involving noncircular complex strongly super-Gaussian sources are illustrated by the biomedical problem of atrial activity (AA) extraction in atrial fibrillation (AF) electrocardiograms (ECGs), where it outperforms an alternative ICA-based technique."}
{"text": "Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications, especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.). It is to be expected in such cases that learning algorithms will have to deal with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the handling of malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution we analyze the performance of a particular method -- online centroid anomaly detection -- in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, analysis of its efficiency and constraints. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly under different conditions: bounded and unbounded percentage of traffic, and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation carried out on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and practicality of our protection mechanisms."}
{"text": "We introduce supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), a statistical model of labelled documents. The model accommodates a variety of response types. We derive an approximate maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation, which relies on variational methods to handle intractable posterior expectations. Prediction problems motivate this research: we use the fitted model to predict response values for new documents. We test sLDA on two real-world problems: movie ratings predicted from reviews, and the political tone of amendments in the U.S. Senate based on the amendment text. We illustrate the benefits of sLDA versus modern regularized regression, as well as versus an unsupervised LDA analysis followed by a separate regression."}
{"text": "We study the problem of allocating stocks to dark pools. We propose and analyze an optimal approach for allocations, if continuous-valued allocations are allowed.

The resulting algorithms are efficient, and perform well in simulations under stochastic and adversarial inputs."}
{"text": "We propose a novel algorithm for greedy forward feature selection for regularized least-squares (RLS) regression and classification, also known as the least-squares support vector machine or ridge regression. The algorithm, which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition. We experimentally demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm and its ability to find good quality feature sets."}

This approach was motivated by the Divisive Information-Theoretic Feature Clustering model in probabilistic space with Kullback-Leibler divergence which may be regarded as a special case within the Clustering Minimisation framework. Also, we propose clustering regularization restricting creation of additional clusters which are not significant or are not essentially different comparing with existing clusters."}
{"text": "In this paper we consider sparse and identifiable linear latent variable (factor) and linear Bayesian network models for parsimonious analysis of multivariate data. We propose a computationally efficient method for joint parameter and model inference, and model comparison. It consists of a fully Bayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component delta-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a stochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we call SLIM (Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling), is validated and bench-marked on artificial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in spirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in inference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison. Experimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with comparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic search strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identifiability), which is an explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d. linear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM (Sparse Non-linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for correlations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the temporal and/or spatial data. The source code and scripts are available from http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/slim/."}
{"text": "We introduce an efficient method for training the linear ranking support vector machine. The method combines cutting plane optimization with red-black tree based approach to subgradient calculations, and has O(m*s+m*log(m)) time complexity, where m is the number of training examples, and s the average number of non-zero features per example. Best previously known training algorithms achieve the same efficiency only for restricted special cases, whereas the proposed approach allows any real valued utility scores in the training data. Experiments demonstrate the superior scalability of the proposed approach, when compared to the fastest existing RankSVM implementations."}
{"text": "The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma allows for the projection of $n$ points in $p-$dimensional Euclidean space onto a $k-$dimensional Euclidean space, with $k \\ge \\frac{24\\ln \\emph{n}}{3\\epsilon^2-2\\epsilon^3}$, so that the pairwise distances are preserved within a factor of $1\\pm\\epsilon$. Here, working directly with the distributions of the random distances rather than resorting to the moment generating function technique, an improvement on the lower bound for $k$ is obtained. The additional reduction in dimension when compared to bounds found in the literature, is at least $13\\%$, and, in some cases, up to $30\\%$ additional reduction is achieved. Using the moment generating function technique, we further provide a lower bound for $k$ using pairwise $L_2$ distances in the space of points to be projected and pairwise $L_1$ distances in the space of the projected points. Comparison with the results obtained in the literature shows that the bound presented here provides an additional $36-40\\%$ reduction."}
{"text": "We improve recently published results about resources of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) required to make them Universal Approximators. We show that any distribution p on the set of binary vectors of length n can be arbitrarily well approximated by an RBM with k-1 hidden units, where k is the minimal number of pairs of binary vectors differing in only one entry such that their union contains the support set of p. In important cases this number is half of the cardinality of the support set of p. We construct a DBN with 2^n/2(n-b), b ~ log(n), hidden layers of width n that is capable of approximating any distribution on {0,1}^n arbitrarily well. This confirms a conjecture presented by Le Roux and Bengio 2010."}
{"text": "A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include $K$-fold cross-validation ($K$-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including $K$-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures."}
{"text": "Density modeling is notoriously difficult for high dimensional data. One approach to the problem is to search for a lower dimensional manifold which captures the main characteristics of the data. Recently, the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) has successfully been used to find low dimensional manifolds in a variety of complex data. The GPLVM consists of a set of points in a low dimensional latent space, and a stochastic map to the observed space. We show how it can be interpreted as a density model in the observed space. However, the GPLVM is not trained as a density model and therefore yields bad density estimates. We propose a new training strategy and obtain improved generalisation performance and better density estimates in comparative evaluations on several benchmark data sets."}

{"text": "A popular method for selecting the number of clusters is based on stability arguments: one chooses the number of clusters such that the corresponding clustering results are \"most stable\". In recent years, a series of papers has analyzed the behavior of this method from a theoretical point of view. However, the results are very technical and difficult to interpret for non-experts. In this paper we give a high-level overview about the existing literature on clustering stability. In addition to presenting the results in a slightly informal but accessible way, we relate them to each other and discuss their different implications."}
{"text": "Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from multi-object tracking to ranking of instances. The difficulty of dealing with these distributions is caused by the size of their domain, which is factorial in the number of considered entities ($n!$). It makes the direct definition of a multinomial distribution over permutation space impractical for all but a very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in $\\mathbbm{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result of the embedding, we acquire ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of directional statistics. We provide polynomial time projections between the continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space. The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations. As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations. We demonstrate the approach with applications."}
{"text": "Supervised linear feature extraction can be achieved by fitting a reduced rank multivariate model. This paper studies rank penalized and rank constrained vector generalized linear models. From the perspective of thresholding rules, we build a framework for fitting singular value penalized models and use it for feature extraction. Through solving the rank constraint form of the problem, we propose progressive feature space reduction for fast computation in high dimensions with little performance loss. A novel projective cross-validation is proposed for parameter tuning in such nonconvex setups. Real data applications are given to show the power of the methodology in supervised dimension reduction and feature extraction."}
{"text": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are special kernel based methods and belong to the most successful learning methods since more than a decade. SVMs can informally be described as a kind of regularized M-estimators for functions and have demonstrated their usefulness in many complicated real-life problems. During the last years a great part of the statistical research on SVMs has concentrated on the question how to design SVMs such that they are universally consistent and statistically robust for nonparametric classification or nonparametric regression purposes. In many applications, some qualitative prior knowledge of the distribution P or of the unknown function f to be estimated is present or the prediction function with a good interpretability is desired, such that a semiparametric model or an additive model is of interest.   In this paper we mainly address the question how to design SVMs by choosing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) or its corresponding kernel to obtain consistent and statistically robust estimators in additive models. We give an explicit construction of kernels - and thus of their RKHSs - which leads in combination with a Lipschitz continuous loss function to consistent and statistically robust SMVs for additive models. Examples are quantile regression based on the pinball loss function, regression based on the epsilon-insensitive loss function, and classification based on the hinge loss function."}
{"text": "In the last few years, many different performance measures have been introduced to overcome the weakness of the most natural metric, the Accuracy. Among them, Matthews Correlation Coefficient has recently gained popularity among researchers not only in machine learning but also in several application fields such as bioinformatics. Nonetheless, further novel functions are being proposed in literature. We show that Confusion Entropy, a recently introduced classifier performance measure for multi-class problems, has a strong (monotone) relation with the multi-class generalization of a classical metric, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Computational evidence in support of the claim is provided, together with an outline of the theoretical explanation."}
{"text": "We propose a simple kernel based nearest neighbor approach for handwritten digit classification. The \"distance\" here is actually a kernel defining the similarity between two images. We carefully study the effects of different number of neighbors and weight schemes and report the results. With only a few nearest neighbors (or most similar images) to vote, the test set error rate on MNIST database could reach about 1.5%-2.0%, which is very close to many advanced models."}
{"text": "Kernel Induced Random Survival Forests (KIRSF) is a statistical learning algorithm which aims to improve prediction accuracy for survival data. As in Random Survival Forests (RSF), Cumulative Hazard Function is predicted for each individual in the test set. Prediction error is estimated using Harrell's concordance index (C index) [Harrell et al. (1982)]. The C-index can be interpreted as a misclassification probability and does not depend on a single fixed time for evaluation. The C-index also specifically accounts for censoring. By utilizing kernel functions, KIRSF achieves better results than RSF in many situations. In this report, we show how to incorporate kernel functions into RSF. We test the performance of KIRSF and compare our method to RSF. We find that the KIRSF's performance is better than RSF in many occasions."}
{"text": "Since learning is typically very slow in Boltzmann machines, there is a need to restrict connections within hidden layers. However, the resulting states of hidden units exhibit statistical dependencies. Based on this observation, we propose using $l_1/l_2$ regularization upon the activation possibilities of hidden units in restricted Boltzmann machines to capture the loacal dependencies among hidden units. This regularization not only encourages hidden units of many groups to be inactive given observed data but also makes hidden units within a group compete with each other for modeling observed data. Thus, the $l_1/l_2$ regularization on RBMs yields sparsity at both the group and the hidden unit levels. We call RBMs trained with the regularizer \\emph{sparse group} RBMs. The proposed sparse group RBMs are applied to three tasks: modeling patches of natural images, modeling handwritten digits and pretaining a deep networks for a classification task. Furthermore, we illustrate the regularizer can also be applied to deep Boltzmann machines, which lead to sparse group deep Boltzmann machines. When adapted to the MNIST data set, a two-layer sparse group Boltzmann machine achieves an error rate of $0.84\\%$, which is, to our knowledge, the best published result on the permutation-invariant version of the MNIST task."}
{"text": "We sharply characterize the performance of different penalization schemes for the problem of selecting the relevant variables in the multi-task setting. Previous work focuses on the regression problem where conditions on the design matrix complicate the analysis. A clearer and simpler picture emerges by studying the Normal means model. This model, often used in the field of statistics, is a simplified model that provides a laboratory for studying complex procedures."}
{"text": "Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper efficient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using the L1-norm. Our method is efficient and scales gracefully to millions of variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: first, we consider fixed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where learned dictionary elements naturally organize in a prespecified arborescent structure, leading to a better performance in reconstruction of natural image patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models."}
{"text": "We present surrogate regret bounds for arbitrary surrogate losses in the context of binary classification with label-dependent costs. Such bounds relate a classifier's risk, assessed with respect to a surrogate loss, to its cost-sensitive classification risk. Two approaches to surrogate regret bounds are developed. The first is a direct generalization of Bartlett et al. [2006], who focus on margin-based losses and cost-insensitive classification, while the second adopts the framework of Steinwart [2007] based on calibration functions. Nontrivial surrogate regret bounds are shown to exist precisely when the surrogate loss satisfies a \"calibration\" condition that is easily verified for many common losses. We apply this theory to the class of uneven margin losses, and characterize when these losses are properly calibrated. The uneven hinge, squared error, exponential, and sigmoid losses are then treated in detail."}
{"text": "Finding sparse solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem in signal processing and statistics which has become a subject of interest in recent years. In general, these systems have infinitely many solutions. However, it may be shown that sufficiently sparse solutions may be identified uniquely. In other words, the corresponding linear transformation will be invertible if we restrict its domain to sufficiently sparse vectors. This property may be used, for example, to solve the underdetermined Blind Source Separation (BSS) problem, or to find sparse representation of a signal in an `overcomplete' dictionary of primitive elements (i.e., the so-called atomic decomposition). The main drawback of current methods of finding sparse solutions is their computational complexity. In this paper, we will show that by detecting `active' components of the (potential) solution, i.e., those components having a considerable value, a framework for fast solution of the problem may be devised. The idea leads to a family of algorithms, called `Iterative Detection-Estimation (IDE)', which converge to the solution by successive detection and estimation of its active part. Comparing the performance of IDE(s) with one of the most successful method to date, which is based on Linear Programming (LP), an improvement in speed of about two to three orders of magnitude is observed."}
{"text": "Modeling data with linear combinations of a few elements from a learned dictionary has been the focus of much recent research in machine learning, neuroscience and signal processing. For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult. In this paper, we present a general formulation for supervised dictionary learning adapted to a wide variety of tasks, and present an efficient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on handwritten digit classification, digital art identification, nonlinear inverse image problems, and compressed sensing demonstrate that our approach is effective in large-scale settings, and is well suited to supervised and semi-supervised classification, as well as regression tasks for data that admit sparse representations."}
{"text": "A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Baysian computation without likelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model."}
{"text": "In nonparametric classification and regression problems, regularized kernel methods, in particular support vector machines, attract much attention in theoretical and in applied statistics. In an abstract sense, regularized kernel methods (simply called SVMs here) can be seen as regularized M-estimators for a parameter in a (typically infinite dimensional) reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For smooth loss functions, it is shown that the difference between the estimator, i.e.\\ the empirical SVM, and the theoretical SVM is asymptotically normal with rate $\\sqrt{n}$. That is, the standardized difference converges weakly to a Gaussian process in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As common in real applications, the choice of the regularization parameter may depend on the data. The proof is done by an application of the functional delta-method and by showing that the SVM-functional is suitably Hadamard-differentiable."}
{"text": "We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. This problem is relevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero components of this vector can be \"relaxed\" by regularizing the squared error with a convex penalty function like the $\\ell_1$ norm. However, in many applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In this paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\\ell_1$ norm and is flexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish the basic properties of these penalty functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso method and other related methods."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of learning a binary classifier from a training set of positive and unlabeled examples, both in the inductive and in the transductive setting. This problem, often referred to as \\emph{PU learning}, differs from the standard supervised classification problem by the lack of negative examples in the training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous situation in many applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking, when we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data sharing the same property among a large and easily available pool of unlabeled data. We propose a conceptually simple method, akin to bagging, to approach both inductive and transductive PU learning problems, by converting them into series of supervised binary classification problems discriminating the known positive examples from random subsamples of the unlabeled set. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of the method on simulated and real data, where it performs at least as well as existing methods while being faster."}
{"text": "Despite the recent progress towards efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL), the structured output case remains an open research front. Current approaches involve repeatedly solving a batch learning problem, which makes them inadequate for large scale scenarios. We propose a new family of online proximal algorithms for MKL (as well as for group-lasso and variants thereof), which overcomes that drawback. We show regret, convergence, and generalization bounds for the proposed method. Experiments on handwriting recognition and dependency parsing testify for the successfulness of the approach."}
{"text": "The group lasso is a penalized regression method, used in regression problems where the covariates are partitioned into groups to promote sparsity at the group level. Existing methods for finding the group lasso estimator either use gradient projection methods to update the entire coefficient vector simultaneously at each step, or update one group of coefficients at a time using an inexact line search to approximate the optimal value for the group of coefficients when all other groups' coefficients are fixed. We present a new method of computation for the group lasso in the linear regression case, the Single Line Search (SLS) algorithm, which operates by computing the exact optimal value for each group (when all other coefficients are fixed) with one univariate line search. We perform simulations demonstrating that the SLS algorithm is often more efficient than existing computational methods. We also extend the SLS algorithm to the sparse group lasso problem via the Signed Single Line Search (SSLS) algorithm, and give theoretical results to support both algorithms."}
{"text": "We have developed an efficient algorithm for the maximum likelihood joint tracking and association problem in a strong clutter for GMTI data. By using an iterative procedure of the dynamic logic process \"from vague-to-crisp,\" the new tracker overcomes combinatorial complexity of tracking in highly-cluttered scenarios and results in a significant improvement in signal-to-clutter ratio."}
{"text": "A density ratio is defined by the ratio of two probability densities. We study the inference problem of density ratios and apply a semi-parametric density-ratio estimator to the two-sample homogeneity test. In the proposed test procedure, the f-divergence between two probability densities is estimated using a density-ratio estimator. The f-divergence estimator is then exploited for the two-sample homogeneity test. We derive the optimal estimator of f-divergence in the sense of the asymptotic variance, and then investigate the relation between the proposed test procedure and the existing score test based on empirical likelihood estimator. Through numerical studies, we illustrate the adequacy of the asymptotic theory for finite-sample inference."}
{"text": "In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for empirical risk minimizers. In the general setting, we prove sanity-check bounds in the spirit of \\cite{KR99} \\textquotedblleft\\textit{bounds showing that the worst-case error of this estimate is not much worse that of training error estimate} \\textquotedblright . General loss functions and class of predictors with finite VC-dimension are considered. We closely follow the formalism introduced by \\cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$% -fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\\upsilon$-out cross-validation.   In particular, we focus on proving the consistency of the various cross-validation procedures. We point out the interest of each cross-validation procedure in terms of rate of convergence. An estimation curve with transition phases depending on the cross-validation procedure and not only on the percentage of observations in the test sample gives a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation. An interesting consequence is that the size of the test sample is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the cross-validation procedure."}
{"text": "The performance of the Lasso is well understood under the assumptions of the standard linear model with homoscedastic noise. However, in several applications, the standard model does not describe the important features of the data. This paper examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model that is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation. Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are \\textit{not} independent of the design matrix.   More specifically, this paper studies the sign consistency of the Lasso under a sparse Poisson-like model. In addition to studying sufficient conditions for the sign consistency of the Lasso estimate, this paper also gives necessary conditions for sign consistency. Both sets of conditions are comparable to results for the homoscedastic model, showing that when a measure of the signal to noise ratio is large, the Lasso performs well on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data.   Simulations reveal that the Lasso performs equally well in terms of model selection performance on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data (with properly scaled noise variance), across a range of parameterizations. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the Lasso is robust to the Poisson-like heteroscedastic noise."}
{"text": "Often we wish to predict a large number of variables that depend on each other as well as on other observed variables. Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classification and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random fields, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields."}
{"text": "In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for stable predictors in the context of risk assessment. The notion of stability has been first introduced by \\cite{DEWA79} and extended by \\cite{KEA95}, \\cite{BE01} and \\cite{KUNIY02} to characterize class of predictors with infinite VC dimension. In particular, this covers $k$-nearest neighbors rules, bayesian algorithm (\\cite{KEA95}), boosting,... General loss functions and class of predictors are considered.

In particular, we give a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation, depending on the stability of the class of predictors. In the special case of uniform stability, an interesting consequence is that the number of elements in the test set is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the cross-validation procedure. In this special case, the particular interest of leave-one-out cross-validation is emphasized."}

{"text": "The goal of cross-domain object matching (CDOM) is to find correspondence between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. Photo album summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system. CDOM is usually formulated as finding a mapping from objects in one domain (photos) to objects in the other domain (frame) so that the pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art CDOM method employs a kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that the kernel parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection problem. Through experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and photo album summarization tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated."}
{"text": "Translating potential disease biomarkers between multi-species 'omics' experiments is a new direction in biomedical research. The existing methods are limited to simple experimental setups such as basic healthy-diseased comparisons. Most of these methods also require an a priori matching of the variables (e.g., genes or metabolites) between the species. However, many experiments have a complicated multi-way experimental design often involving irregularly-sampled time-series measurements, and for instance metabolites do not always have known matchings between organisms. We introduce a Bayesian modelling framework for translating between multiple species the results from 'omics' experiments having a complex multi-way, time-series experimental design. The underlying assumption is that the unknown matching can be inferred from the response of the variables to multiple covariates including time."}
{"text": "We propose a novel algorithm to solve the expectation propagation relaxation of Bayesian inference for continuous-variable graphical models. In contrast to most previous algorithms, our method is provably convergent. By marrying convergent EP ideas from (Opper&Winther 05) with covariance decoupling techniques (Wipf&Nagarajan 08, Nickisch&Seeger 09), it runs at least an order of magnitude faster than the most commonly used EP solver."}
{"text": "We study the problem of estimating a temporally varying coefficient and varying structure (VCVS) graphical model underlying nonstationary time series data, such as social states of interacting individuals or microarray expression profiles of gene networks, as opposed to i.i.d. data from an invariant model widely considered in current literature of structural estimation. In particular, we consider the scenario in which the model evolves in a piece-wise constant fashion. We propose a procedure that minimizes the so-called TESLA loss (i.e., temporally smoothed L1 regularized regression), which allows jointly estimating the partition boundaries of the VCVS model and the coefficient of the sparse precision matrix on each block of the partition. A highly scalable proximal gradient method is proposed to solve the resultant convex optimization problem; and the conditions for sparsistent estimation and the convergence rate of both the partition boundaries and the network structure are established for the first time for such estimators."}
{"text": "We propose a novel application of the Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (S-OMP) procedure for sparsistant variable selection in ultra-high dimensional multi-task regression problems. Screening of variables, as introduced in \\cite{fan08sis}, is an efficient and highly scalable way to remove many irrelevant variables from the set of all variables, while retaining all the relevant variables. S-OMP can be applied to problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and once the number of variables is reduced to a manageable size, a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to identify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize relatedness of multiple outputs to perform fast screening of relevant variables. As our main theoretical contribution, we prove that, asymptotically, S-OMP is guaranteed to reduce an ultra-high number of variables to below the sample size without losing true relevant variables. We also provide formal evidence that a modified Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can be used to efficiently determine the number of iterations in S-OMP. We further provide empirical evidence on the benefit of variable selection using multiple regression outputs jointly, as opposed to performing variable selection for each output separately. The finite sample performance of S-OMP is demonstrated on extensive simulation studies, and on a genetic association mapping problem. $Keywords$ Adaptive Lasso; Greedy forward regression; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Multi-output regression; Multi-task learning; Simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit; Sure screening; Variable selection"}
{"text": "With the present revival of interest in bistatic radar systems, research in that area has gained momentum. Given some of the strategic advantages for a bistatic configuration, and tech- nological advances in the past few years, large-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near future. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least par- tially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be manageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities of an automatic target recognition (ATR) facil- ity in a bistatic radar system is presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on simulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for the introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that, contrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be substantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR performed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the ATR per- formance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic angle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have distinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results, suggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR per- formance with changing bistatic angle. Finally, a new fast and robust ATR algorithm (developed in the present work) has been presented."}
{"text": "In the applications related to airborne radars, simulation has always played an important role. This is mainly because of the two fold reason of the unavailability of desired data and the difficulty associated with the collection of data under controlled environment. A simple example will be regarding the collection of pure multipolar radar data. Even after phenomenal development in the field of radar hardware design and signal processing, till now the collection of pure multipolar data is a challenge for the radar system designers. Till very recently, the power of computer simulation of radar signal return was available to a very selected few. This was because of the heavy cost associated with some of the main line electro magnetic (EM) simulators for radar signal simulation, and secondly because many such EM simulators are for restricted marketting. However, because of the fast progress made in the field of EM simulation, many of the current generic EM simulators can be used to simulate radar returns from realistic targets. The current article expounds the steps towards generating a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image database of ground targets, using a eneric EM g simulator. It also demonstrates by the help of some example images, the quality of the SAR mage generated i using a general purpose EM simulator."}
{"text": "We propose in this work a new family of kernels for variable-length time series. Our work builds upon the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for multivariate stochastic processes: given a multivariate time series x, we consider the likelihood function p_{\\theta}(x) of different parameters \\theta in the VAR model as features to describe x. To compare two time series x and x', we form the product of their features p_{\\theta}(x) p_{\\theta}(x') which is integrated out w.r.t \\theta using a matrix normal-inverse Wishart prior. Among other properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of the time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x and x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary state spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel \\kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram matrices produced by \\kappa on observations and subsequences of observations enumerated in x and x'. We describe a computationally efficient implementation of this generalization that uses low-rank matrix factorization techniques. These kernels are compared to other known kernels using a set of benchmark classification tasks carried out with support vector machines."}
{"text": "Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to analyze causal relations between continuous variables. In such frameworks, linear acyclic models are typically used to model the data-generating process of variables. Recently, it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identifies the full structure of a linear acyclic model, i.e., a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths, without using any prior knowledge on the network structure, which is not the case with conventional methods. However, existing estimation methods are based on iterative search algorithms and may not converge to a correct solution in a finite number of steps. In this paper, we propose a new direct method to estimate a causal ordering and connection strengths based on non-Gaussianity.   In contrast to the previous methods, our algorithm requires no algorithmic parameters and is guaranteed to converge to the right solution within a small fixed number of steps if the data strictly follows the model."}
{"text": "Existing approaches to analyzing the asymptotics of graph Laplacians typically assume a well-behaved kernel function with smoothness assumptions. We remove the smoothness assumption and generalize the analysis of graph Laplacians to include previously unstudied graphs including kNN graphs.

We also describe how for a given limiting Laplacian operator desirable properties such as a convergent spectrum and sparseness can be achieved choosing the appropriate graph construction."}
{"text": "A collaborative convex framework for factoring a data matrix $X$ into a non-negative product $AS$, with a sparse coefficient matrix $S$, is proposed. We restrict the columns of the dictionary matrix $A$ to coincide with certain columns of the data matrix $X$, thereby guaranteeing a physically meaningful dictionary and dimensionality reduction. We use $l_{1,\\infty}$ regularization to select the dictionary from the data and show this leads to an exact convex relaxation of $l_0$ in the case of distinct noise free data. We also show how to relax the restriction-to-$X$ constraint by initializing an alternating minimization approach with the solution of the convex model, obtaining a dictionary close to but not necessarily in $X$. We focus on applications of the proposed framework to hyperspectral endmember and abundances identification and also show an application to blind source separation of NMR data."}
{"text": "This paper treats the problem of screening for variables with high correlations in high dimensional data in which there can be many fewer samples than variables. We focus on threshold-based correlation screening methods for three related applications: screening for variables with large correlations within a single treatment (autocorrelation screening); screening for variables with large cross-correlations over two treatments (cross-correlation screening); screening for variables that have persistently large auto-correlations over two treatments (persistent-correlation screening). The novelty of correlation screening is that it identifies a smaller number of variables which are highly correlated with others, as compared to identifying a number of correlation parameters. Correlation screening suffers from a phase transition phenomenon: as the correlation threshold decreases the number of discoveries increases abruptly. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the mean number of discoveries and the phase transition thresholds as a function of the number of samples, the number of variables, and the joint sample distribution. We also show that under a weak dependency condition the number of discoveries is dominated by a Poisson random variable giving an asymptotic expression for the false positive rate. The correlation screening approach bears tremendous dividends in terms of the type and strength of the asymptotic results that can be obtained. It also overcomes some of the major hurdles faced by existing methods in the literature as correlation screening is naturally scalable to high dimension. Numerical results strongly validate the theory that is presented in this paper. We illustrate the application of the correlation screening methodology on a large scale gene-expression dataset, revealing a few influential variables that exhibit a significant amount of correlation over multiple treatments."}
{"text": "Unsupervised discovery of latent representations, in addition to being useful for density modeling, visualisation and exploratory data analysis, is also increasingly important for learning features relevant to discriminative tasks. Autoencoders, in particular, have proven to be an effective way to learn latent codes that reflect meaningful variations in data. A continuing challenge, however, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for particular tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are invariant to irrelevant transformations of the data. The most common way of introducing such problem-specific guidance in autoencoders has been through the incorporation of a parametric component that ties the latent representation to the label information. In this work, we argue that a preferable approach relies instead on a nonparametric guidance mechanism. Conceptually, it ensures that there exists a function that can predict the label information, without explicitly instantiating that function. The superiority of this guidance mechanism is confirmed on two datasets. In particular, this approach is able to incorporate invariance information (lighting, elevation, etc.) from the small NORB object recognition dataset and yields state-of-the-art performance for a single layer, non-convolutional network."}
{"text": "We propose an active set selection framework for Gaussian process classification for cases when the dataset is large enough to render its inference prohibitive. Our scheme consists of a two step alternating procedure of active set update rules and hyperparameter optimization based upon marginal likelihood maximization. The active set update rules rely on the ability of the predictive distributions of a Gaussian process classifier to estimate the relative contribution of a datapoint when being either included or removed from the model. This means that we can use it to include points with potentially high impact to the classifier decision process while removing those that are less relevant. We introduce two active set rules based on different criteria, the first one prefers a model with interpretable active set parameters whereas the second puts computational complexity first, thus a model with active set parameters that directly control its complexity. We also provide both theoretical and empirical support for our active set selection strategy being a good approximation of a full Gaussian process classifier. Our extensive experiments show that our approach can compete with state-of-the-art classification techniques with reasonable time complexity.

{"text": "We investigate the learning rate of multiple kernel leaning (MKL) with elastic-net regularization, which consists of an $\\ell_1$-regularizer for inducing the sparsity and an $\\ell_2$-regularizer for controlling the smoothness. We focus on a sparse setting where the total number of kernels is large but the number of non-zero components of the ground truth is relatively small, and prove that elastic-net MKL achieves the minimax learning rate on the $\\ell_2$-mixed-norm ball. Our bound is sharper than the convergence rates ever shown, and has a property that the smoother the truth is, the faster the convergence rate is."}
{"text": "We derive an upper bound on the local Rademacher complexity of $\\ell_p$-norm multiple kernel learning, which yields a tighter excess risk bound than global approaches. Previous local approaches aimed at analyzed the case $p=1$ only while our analysis covers all cases $1\\leq p\\leq\\infty$, assuming the different feature mappings corresponding to the different kernels to be uncorrelated. We also show a lower bound that shows that the bound is tight, and derive consequences regarding excess loss, namely fast convergence rates of the order $O(n^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}})$, where $\\alpha$ is the minimum eigenvalue decay rate of the individual kernels."}
{"text": "We present a probabilistic viewpoint to multiple kernel learning unifying well-known regularised risk approaches and recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference relaxations. The framework proposes a general objective function suitable for regression, robust regression and classification that is lower bound of the marginal likelihood and contains many regularised risk approaches as special cases. Furthermore, we derive an efficient and provably convergent optimisation algorithm."}
{"text": "Gaussian Process (GP) models are often used as mathematical approximations of computationally expensive experiments. Provided that its kernel is suitably chosen and that enough data is available to obtain a reasonable fit of the simulator, a GP model can beneficially be used for tasks such as prediction, optimization, or Monte-Carlo-based quantification of uncertainty. However, the former conditions become unrealistic when using classical GPs as the dimension of input increases. One popular alternative is then to turn to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), relying on the assumption that the simulator's response can approximately be decomposed as a sum of univariate functions. If such an approach has been successfully applied in approximation, it is nevertheless not completely compatible with the GP framework and its versatile applications. The ambition of the present work is to give an insight into the use of GPs for additive models by integrating additivity within the kernel, and proposing a parsimonious numerical method for data-driven parameter estimation. The first part of this article deals with the kernels naturally associated to additive processes and the properties of the GP models based on such kernels. The second part is dedicated to a numerical procedure based on relaxation for additive kernel parameter estimation. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated and compared to other approaches on Sobol's g-function."}
{"text": "We present two sets of theoretical results on the grouped lasso with overlap of Jacob, Obozinski and Vert (2009) in the linear regression setting. This method allows for joint selection of predictors in sparse regression, allowing for complex structured sparsity over the predictors encoded as a set of groups. This flexible framework suggests that arbitrarily complex structures can be encoded with an intricate set of groups. Our results show that this strategy results in unexpected theoretical consequences for the procedure. In particular, we give two sets of results: (1) finite sample bounds on prediction and estimation, and (2) asymptotic distribution and selection. Both sets of results give insight into the consequences of choosing an increasingly complex set of groups for the procedure, as well as what happens when the set of groups cannot recover the true sparsity pattern. Additionally, these results demonstrate the differences and similarities between the the grouped lasso procedure with and without overlapping groups. Our analysis shows the set of groups must be chosen with caution - an overly complex set of groups will damage the analysis."}
{"text": "We present the discrete infinite logistic normal distribution (DILN), a Bayesian nonparametric prior for mixed membership models. DILN is a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that models correlation structure between the weights of the atoms at the group level. We derive a representation of DILN as a normalized collection of gamma-distributed random variables, and study its statistical properties. We consider applications to topic modeling and derive a variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference. We study the empirical performance of the DILN topic model on four corpora, comparing performance with the HDP and the correlated topic model (CTM). To deal with large-scale data sets, we also develop an online inference algorithm for DILN and compare with online HDP and online LDA on the Nature magazine, which contains approximately 350,000 articles."}
{"text": "The purpose of sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is to find the low-dimensional subspace of input features that is sufficient for predicting output values. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-free SDR method called sufficient component analysis (SCA), which is computationally more efficient than existing methods. In our method, a solution is computed by iteratively performing dependence estimation and maximization: Dependence estimation is analytically carried out by recently-proposed least-squares mutual information (LSMI), and dependence maximization is also analytically carried out by utilizing the Epanechnikov kernel. Through large-scale experiments on real-world image classification and audio tagging problems, the proposed method is shown to compare favorably with existing dimension reduction approaches."}
{"text": "We theoretically investigate the convergence rate and support consistency (i.e., correctly identifying the subset of non-zero coefficients in the large sample limit) of multiple kernel learning (MKL). We focus on MKL with block-l1 regularization (inducing sparse kernel combination), block-l2 regularization (inducing uniform kernel combination), and elastic-net regularization (including both block-l1 and block-l2 regularization). For the case where the true kernel combination is sparse, we show a sharper convergence rate of the block-l1 and elastic-net MKL methods than the existing rate for block-l1 MKL. We further show that elastic-net MKL requires a milder condition for being consistent than block-l1 MKL. For the case where the optimal kernel combination is not exactly sparse, we prove that elastic-net MKL can achieve a faster convergence rate than the block-l1 and block-l2 MKL methods by carefully controlling the balance between the block-l1and block-l2 regularizers. Thus, our theoretical results overall suggest the use of elastic-net regularization in MKL."}
{"text": "In this paper, we give a new sharp generalization bound of lp-MKL which is a generalized framework of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and imposes lp-mixed-norm regularization instead of l1-mixed-norm regularization. We utilize localization techniques to obtain the sharp learning rate. The bound is characterized by the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the associated kernels. A larger decay rate gives a faster convergence rate. Furthermore, we give the minimax learning rate on the ball characterized by lp-mixed-norm in the product space. Then we show that our derived learning rate of lp-MKL achieves the minimax optimal rate on the lp-mixed-norm ball."}
{"text": "The discovery of non-linear causal relationship under additive non-Gaussian noise models has attracted considerable attention recently because of their high flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference algorithm called least-squares independence regression (LSIR). LSIR learns the additive noise model through the minimization of an estimator of the squared-loss mutual information between inputs and residuals. A notable advantage of LSIR over existing approaches is that tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be naturally optimized by cross-validation, allowing us to avoid overfitting in a data-dependent fashion. Through experiments with real-world datasets, we show that LSIR compares favorably with a state-of-the-art causal inference method."}
{"text": "In this paper, auto-associative models are proposed as candidates to the generalization of Principal Component Analysis. We show that these models are dedicated to the approximation of the dataset by a manifold. Here, the word \"manifold\" refers to the topology properties of the structure. The approximating manifold is built by a projection pursuit algorithm. At each step of the algorithm, the dimension of the manifold is incremented. Some theoretical properties are provided. In particular, we can show that, at each step of the algorithm, the mean residuals norm is not increased. Moreover, it is also established that the algorithm converges in a finite number of steps. Some particular auto-associative models are exhibited and compared to the classical PCA and some neural networks models. Implementation aspects are discussed. We show that, in numerous cases, no optimization procedure is required. Some illustrations on simulated and real data are presented."}
{"text": "Nonparametric methods are widely applicable to statistical inference problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric regression against outliers - that is, data markedly deviating from the postulated models. A variational counterpart to least-trimmed squares regression is shown closely related to an L0-(pseudo)norm-regularized estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type estimator equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier vector along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced bias and enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of an improved estimator obtained after replacing the L0-(pseudo)norm with a nonconvex surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is adopted to cleanse load curve data, a key task aiding operational decisions in the envisioned smart grid system. Computer simulations and tests on real load curve data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel sparsity-controlling robust estimators."}
{"text": "Many real-world problems encountered in several disciplines deal with the modeling of time-series containing different underlying dynamical regimes, for which probabilistic approaches are very often employed. In this paper we describe several such approaches in the common framework of graphical models. We give a unified overview of models previously introduced in the literature, which is simpler and more comprehensive than previous descriptions and enables us to highlight commonalities and differences among models that were not observed in the past. In addition, we present several new models and inference routines, which are naturally derived within this unified viewpoint."}
{"text": "A linear non-Gaussian structural equation model called LiNGAM is an identifiable model for exploratory causal analysis. Previous methods estimate a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths based on a single dataset. However, in many application domains, data are obtained under different conditions, that is, multiple datasets are obtained rather than a single dataset. In this paper, we present a new method to jointly estimate multiple LiNGAMs under the assumption that the models share a causal ordering but may have different connection strengths and differently distributed variables. In simulations, the new method estimates the models more accurately than estimating them separately."}
{"text": "Inverse inference, or \"brain reading\", is a recent paradigm for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, based on pattern recognition and statistical learning. By predicting some cognitive variables related to brain activation maps, this approach aims at decoding brain activity. Inverse inference takes into account the multivariate information between voxels and is currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitive information is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However, it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since there are far more features than samples, i.e., more voxels than fMRI volumes. To address this problem, different methods have been proposed, such as, among others, univariate feature selection, feature agglomeration and regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider a sparse hierarchical structured regularization. Specifically, the penalization we use is constructed from a tree that is obtained by spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering. This approach encodes the spatial structure of the data at different scales into the regularization, which makes the overall prediction procedure more robust to inter-subject variability. The regularization used induces the selection of spatially coherent predictive brain regions simultaneously at different scales. We test our algorithm on real data acquired to study the mental representation of objects, and we show that the proposed algorithm not only delineates meaningful brain regions but yields as well better prediction accuracy than reference methods."}
{"text": "We compare the risk of ridge regression to a simple variant of ordinary least squares, in which one simply projects the data onto a finite dimensional subspace (as specified by a Principal Component Analysis) and then performs an ordinary (un-regularized) least squares regression in this subspace. This note shows that the risk of this ordinary least squares method is within a constant factor (namely 4) of the risk of ridge regression."}
{"text": "We define and discuss the first sparse coding algorithm based on closed-form EM updates and continuous latent variables. The underlying generative model consists of a standard `spike-and-slab' prior and a Gaussian noise model. Closed-form solutions for E- and M-step equations are derived by generalizing probabilistic PCA. The resulting EM algorithm can take all modes of a potentially multi-modal posterior into account. The computational cost of the algorithm scales exponentially with the number of hidden dimensions. However, with current computational resources, it is still possible to efficiently learn model parameters for medium-scale problems. Thus the model can be applied to the typical range of source separation tasks. In numerical experiments on artificial data we verify likelihood maximization and show that the derived algorithm recovers the sparse directions of standard sparse coding distributions. On source separation benchmarks comprised of realistic data we show that the algorithm is competitive with other recent methods."}
{"text": "In data sets with many more features than observations, independent screening based on all univariate regression models leads to a computationally convenient variable selection method. Recent efforts have shown that in the case of generalized linear models, independent screening may suffice to capture all relevant features with high probability, even in ultra-high dimension. It is unclear whether this formal sure screening property is attainable when the response is a right-censored survival time. We propose a computationally very efficient independent screening method for survival data which can be viewed as the natural survival equivalent of correlation screening. We state conditions under which the method admits the sure screening property within a general class of single-index hazard rate models with ultra-high dimensional features. An iterative variant is also described which combines screening with penalized regression in order to handle more complex feature covariance structures. The methods are evaluated through simulation studies and through application to a real gene expression dataset."}
{"text": "We address the online linear optimization problem when the actions of the forecaster are represented by binary vectors. Our goal is to understand the magnitude of the minimax regret for the worst possible set of actions. We study the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial information models of the so-called \"semi-bandit\", and \"bandit\" problems. We consider both $L_\\infty$-, and $L_2$-type of restrictions for the losses assigned by the adversary.   We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied in the series of papers Gyorgy et al. (2007), Dani et al. (2008), Abernethy et al. (2008), Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2009), Helmbold and Warmuth (2009), Koolen et al. (2010), Uchiya et al. (2010), Kale et al. (2010) and Audibert and Bubeck (2010). We provide simple proofs that recover most of the previous results. We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the bandit game, the upper and lower bounds are tight, up to a constant factor. Finally, we answer a question asked by Koolen et al. (2010) by showing that the exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against $L_{\\infty}$ adversaries."}
{"text": "In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a criterion for PAC learnability of a concept class $\\mathscr C$ under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the domain $\\Omega$. The uniform Glivenko--Cantelli property with respect to non-atomic measures is no longer a necessary condition, and consistent learnability cannot in general be expected. Our criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter $\\VC({\\mathscr C}\\,{\\mathrm{mod}}\\,\\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by \"thickening up\" single points in the definition of VC dimension to uncountable \"clusters\". Equivalently, $\\VC(\\mathscr C\\modd\\omega_1)\\leq d$ if and only if every countable subclass of $\\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\\leq d$ outside a countable subset of $\\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed as the classical VC dimension of $\\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset of a compactification of $\\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions on $\\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA). Similar results are obtained for function learning in terms of fat-shattering dimension modulo countable sets, but, just like in the classical distribution-free case, the finiteness of this parameter is sufficient but not necessary for PAC learnability under non-atomic measures."}
{"text": "We propose a restricted collapsed draw (RCD) sampler, a general Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler of simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Chinese restaurant process (HCRP) with restriction. Models that require simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Dirichlet process with restriction, such as infinite Hidden markov models (iHMM), were difficult to enjoy benefits of \\markerg{the} HCRP due to combinatorial explosion in calculating distributions of coupled draws. By constructing a proposal of seating arrangements (partitioning) and stochastically accepts the proposal by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the RCD sampler makes accurate sampling for complex combination of draws while retaining efficiency of HCRP representation. Based on the RCD sampler, we developed a series of sophisticated sampling algorithms for iHMMs, including blocked Gibbs sampling, beam sampling, and split-merge sampling, that outperformed conventional iHMM samplers in experiments"}
{"text": "A number of recent work studied the effectiveness of feature selection using Lasso. It is known that under the restricted isometry properties (RIP), Lasso does not generally lead to the exact recovery of the set of nonzero coefficients, due to the looseness of convex relaxation. This paper considers the feature selection property of nonconvex regularization, where the solution is given by a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure recovers the set of nonzero coefficients without suffering from the bias of Lasso relaxation, which complements parameter estimation results of this procedure."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the problem of inferring sparse causal networks modeled by multivariate auto-regressive (MAR) processes. Conditions are derived under which the Group Lasso (gLasso) procedure consistently estimates sparse network structure. The key condition involves a \"false connection score.\" In particular, we show that consistent recovery is possible even when the number of observations of the network is far less than the number of parameters describing the network, provided that the false connection score is less than one. The false connection score is also demonstrated to be a useful metric of recovery in non-asymptotic regimes. The conditions suggest a modified gLasso procedure which tends to improve the false connection score and reduce the chances of reversing the direction of causal influence. Computational experiments and a real network based electrocorticogram (ECoG) simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."}

{"text": "We introduce the Pitman Yor Diffusion Tree (PYDT) for hierarchical clustering, a generalization of the Dirichlet Diffusion Tree (Neal, 2001) which removes the restriction to binary branching structure. The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary."}
{"text": "Given a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H of real-valued functions and a suitable measure mu over the source space D (subset of R), we decompose H as the sum of a subspace of centered functions for mu and its orthogonal in H. This decomposition leads to a special case of ANOVA kernels, for which the functional ANOVA representation of the best predictor can be elegantly derived, either in an interpolation or regularization framework. The proposed kernels appear to be particularly convenient for analyzing the e ffect of each (group of) variable(s) and computing sensitivity indices without recursivity."}
{"text": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is now a common tool for audio source separation. When learning NMF on large audio databases, one major drawback is that the complexity in time is O(FKN) when updating the dictionary (where (F;N) is the dimension of the input power spectrograms, and K the number of basis spectra), thus forbidding its application on signals longer than an hour. We provide an online algorithm with a complexity of O(FK) in time and memory for updates in the dictionary. We show on audio simulations that the online approach is faster for short audio signals and allows to analyze audio signals of several hours."}
{"text": "We study the problem of estimating from data, a sparse approximation to the inverse covariance matrix. Estimating a sparsity constrained inverse covariance matrix is a key component in Gaussian graphical model learning, but one that is numerically very challenging. We address this challenge by developing a new adaptive gradient-based method that carefully combines gradient information with an adaptive step-scaling strategy, which results in a scalable, highly competitive method. Our algorithm, like its predecessors, maximizes an $\\ell_1$-norm penalized log-likelihood and has the same per iteration arithmetic complexity as the best methods in its class. Our experiments reveal that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, often significantly so, for large problems."}
{"text": "We describe a simple and efficient procedure for approximating the L\\'evy measure of a $\\text{Gamma}(\\alpha,1)$ random variable. We use this approximation to derive a finite sum-representation that converges almost surely to Ferguson's representation of the Dirichlet process based on arrivals of a homogeneous Poisson process. We compare the efficiency of our approximation to several other well known approximations of the Dirichlet process and demonstrate a substantial improvement."}
{"text": "In many areas of machine learning, it becomes necessary to find the eigenvector decompositions of large matrices. We discuss two methods for reducing the computational burden of spectral decompositions: the more venerable Nystom extension and a newly introduced algorithm based on random projections. Previous work has centered on the ability to reconstruct the original matrix. We argue that a more interesting and relevant comparison is their relative performance in clustering and classification tasks using the approximate eigenvectors as features. We demonstrate that performance is task specific and depends on the rank of the approximation."}
{"text": "This paper studies the deviations of the regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. When the total number of plays n is known beforehand by the agent, Audibert et al. (2009) exhibit a policy such that with probability at least 1-1/n, the regret of the policy is of order log(n). They have also shown that such a property is not shared by the popular ucb1 policy of Auer et al. (2002). This work first answers an open question: it extends this negative result to any anytime policy. The second contribution of this paper is to design anytime robust policies for specific multi-armed bandit problems in which some restrictions are put on the set of possible distributions of the different arms."}
{"text": "In many data mining applications collection of sufficiently large datasets is the most time consuming and expensive. On the other hand, industrial methods of data collection create huge databases, and make difficult direct applications of the advanced machine learning algorithms. To address the above problems, we consider active learning (AL), which may be very efficient either for the experimental design or for the data filtering. In this paper we demonstrate using the online evaluation opportunity provided by the AL Challenge that quite competitive results may be produced using a small percentage of the available data. Also, we present several alternative criteria, which may be useful for the evaluation of the active learning processes. The author of this paper attended special presentation in Barcelona, where results of the WCCI 2010 AL Challenge were discussed."}
{"text": "We propose a novel algebraic framework for treating probability distributions represented by their cumulants such as the mean and covariance matrix. As an example, we consider the unsupervised learning problem of finding the subspace on which several probability distributions agree. Instead of minimizing an objective function involving the estimated cumulants, we show that by treating the cumulants as elements of the polynomial ring we can directly solve the problem, at a lower computational cost and with higher accuracy. Moreover, the algebraic viewpoint on probability distributions allows us to invoke the theory of Algebraic Geometry, which we demonstrate in a compact proof for an identifiability criterion."}
{"text": "We present a method to estimate block membership of nodes in a random graph generated by a stochastic blockmodel. We use an embedding procedure motivated by the random dot product graph model, a particular example of the latent position model. The embedding associates each node with a vector; these vectors are clustered via minimization of a square error criterion. We prove that this method is consistent for assigning nodes to blocks, as only a negligible number of nodes will be mis-assigned. We prove consistency of the method for directed and undirected graphs. The consistent block assignment makes possible consistent parameter estimation for a stochastic blockmodel. We extend the result in the setting where the number of blocks grows slowly with the number of nodes. Our method is also computationally feasible even for very large graphs. We compare our method to Laplacian spectral clustering through analysis of simulated data and a graph derived from Wikipedia documents."}
{"text": "In sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), Gaussian scale mixtures (GSMs) have been used to model sparsity-inducing priors that realize a class of concave penalty functions for the regression task in real-valued signal models. Motivated by the relative scarcity of formal tools for SBL in complex-valued models, this paper proposes a GSM model - the Bessel K model - that induces concave penalty functions for the estimation of complex sparse signals. The properties of the Bessel K model are analyzed when it is applied to Type I and Type II estimation. This analysis reveals that, by tuning the parameters of the mixing pdf different penalty functions are invoked depending on the estimation type used, the value of the noise variance, and whether real or complex signals are estimated. Using the Bessel K model, we derive a sparse estimator based on a modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm formulated for Type II estimation. The estimator includes as a special instance the algorithms proposed by Tipping and Faul [1] and by Babacan et al. [2]. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed estimator over these state-of-the-art estimators in terms of convergence speed, sparseness, reconstruction error, and robustness in low and medium signal-to-noise ratio regimes."}
{"text": "Concave regularization methods provide natural procedures for sparse recovery. However, they are difficult to analyze in the high dimensional setting. Only recently a few sparse recovery results have been established for some specific local solutions obtained via specialized numerical procedures. Still, the fundamental relationship between these solutions such as whether they are identical or their relationship to the global minimizer of the underlying nonconvex formulation is unknown. The current paper fills this conceptual gap by presenting a general theoretical framework showing that under appropriate conditions, the global solution of nonconvex regularization leads to desirable recovery performance; moreover, under suitable conditions, the global solution corresponds to the unique sparse local solution, which can be obtained via different numerical procedures. Under this unified framework, we present an overview of existing results and discuss their connections. The unified view of this work leads to a more satisfactory treatment of concave high dimensional sparse estimation procedures, and serves as guideline for developing further numerical procedures for concave regularization."}
{"text": "The performance of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefficient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm [\\textit{IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory} \\textbf{55} (2009) 2183--2202]. Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefficient vector, whereby one has only control on the $\\ell_1$ norm of the smaller coefficients, is also analyzed. As a consequence of these results, we also show that the coefficient estimate satisfies strong oracle type inequalities."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of learning a forest of nonlinear decision rules with general loss functions. The standard methods employ boosted decision trees such as Adaboost for exponential loss and Friedman's gradient boosting for general loss. In contrast to these traditional boosting algorithms that treat a tree learner as a black box, the method we propose directly learns decision forests via fully-corrective regularized greedy search using the underlying forest structure. Our method achieves higher accuracy and smaller models than gradient boosting (and Adaboost with exponential loss) on many datasets."}
{"text": "When response variables are nominal and populations are cross-classified with respect to multiple polytomies, questions often arise about the degree of association of the responses with explanatory variables. When populations are known, we introduce a nominal association vector and matrix to evaluate the dependence of a response variable with an explanatory variable. These measures provide detailed evaluations of nominal associations at both local and global levels. We also define a general class of global association measures which embraces the well known association measure by Goodman-Kruskal (1954). The proposed association matrix also gives rise to the expected generalized confusion matrix in classification. The hierarchy of equivalence relations defined by the association vector and matrix are also shown."}
{"text": "We present a probabilistic model for natural images which is based on Gaussian scale mixtures and a simple multiscale representation. In contrast to the dominant approach to modeling whole images focusing on Markov random fields, we formulate our model in terms of a directed graphical model. We show that it is able to generate images with interesting higher-order correlations when trained on natural images or samples from an occlusion based model. More importantly, the directed model enables us to perform a principled evaluation. While it is easy to generate visually appealing images, we demonstrate that our model also yields the best performance reported to date when evaluated with respect to the cross-entropy rate, a measure tightly linked to the average log-likelihood."}
{"text": "Modelling the real world complexity of music is a challenge for machine learning. We address the task of modeling melodic sequences from the same music genre. We perform a comparative analysis of two probabilistic models; a Dirichlet Variable Length Markov Model (Dirichlet-VMM) and a Time Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TC-RBM). We show that the TC-RBM learns descriptive music features, such as underlying chords and typical melody transitions and dynamics. We assess the models for future prediction and compare their performance to a VMM, which is the current state of the art in melody generation. We show that both models perform significantly better than the VMM, with the Dirichlet-VMM marginally outperforming the TC-RBM. Finally, we evaluate the short order statistics of the models, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between test sequences and model samples, and show that our proposed methods match the statistics of the music genre significantly better than the VMM."}
{"text": "We introduce a factor analysis model that summarizes the dependencies between observed variable groups, instead of dependencies between individual variables as standard factor analysis does. A group may correspond to one view of the same set of objects, one of many data sets tied by co-occurrence, or a set of alternative variables collected from statistics tables to measure one property of interest. We show that by assuming group-wise sparse factors, active in a subset of the sets, the variation can be decomposed into factors explaining relationships between the sets and factors explaining away set-specific variation. We formulate the assumptions in a Bayesian model which provides the factors, and apply the model to two data analysis tasks, in neuroimaging and chemical systems biology."}
{"text": "Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data. These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold). We show that k-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query x and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at x vary with radius.   Furthermore, we show a simple way to choose k = k(x) locally at any x so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at x in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of x. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure."}
{"text": "There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that exact nearest neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces is affected by the curse of dimensionality at a fundamental level. Does it necessarily mean that the same is true for k nearest neighbours based learning algorithms such as the k-NN classifier? We analyse this question at a number of levels and show that the answer is different at each of them. As our first main observation, we show the consistency of a k approximate nearest neighbour classifier. However, the performance of the classifier in very high dimensions is provably unstable. As our second main observation, we point out that the existing model for statistical learning is oblivious of dimension of the domain and so every learning problem admits a universally consistent deterministic reduction to the one-dimensional case by means of a Borel isomorphism."}
{"text": "We propose a method called ideal regression for approximating an arbitrary system of polynomial equations by a system of a particular type. Using techniques from approximate computational algebraic geometry, we show how we can solve ideal regression directly without resorting to numerical optimization. Ideal regression is useful whenever the solution to a learning problem can be described by a system of polynomial equations. As an example, we demonstrate how to formulate Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA), a source separation problem, in terms of ideal regression, which also yields a consistent estimator for SSA. We then compare this estimator in simulations with previous optimization-based approaches for SSA."}
{"text": "We consider a Gaussian process formulation of the multiple kernel learning problem. The goal is to select the convex combination of kernel matrices that best explains the data and by doing so improve the generalisation on unseen data. Sparsity in the kernel weights is obtained by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach: Gaussian process priors are imposed over the latent functions and generalised inverse Gaussians on their associated weights. This construction is equivalent to imposing a product of heavy-tailed process priors over function space. A variational inference algorithm is derived for regression and binary classification."}
{"text": "We propose a scalable, efficient and statistically motivated computational framework for Graphical Lasso (Friedman et al., 2007b) - a covariance regularization framework that has received significant attention in the statistics community over the past few years. Existing algorithms have trouble in scaling to dimensions larger than a thousand. Our proposal significantly enhances the state-of-the-art for such moderate sized problems and gracefully scales to larger problems where other algorithms become practically infeasible. This requires a few key new ideas. We operate on the primal problem and use a subtle variation of block-coordinate-methods which drastically reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the convergence and complexity of our algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal via experiments. We believe that our framework extends the applicability of Graphical Lasso to large-scale modern applications like bioinformatics, collaborative filtering and social networks, among others."}
{"text": "We propose a novel method of introducing structure into existing machine learning techniques by developing structure-based similarity and distance measures. To learn structural information, low-dimensional structure of the data is captured by solving a non-linear, low-rank representation problem. We show that this low-rank representation can be kernelized, has a closed-form solution, allows for separation of independent manifolds, and is robust to noise. From this representation, similarity between observations based on non-linear structure is computed and can be incorporated into existing feature transformations, dimensionality reduction techniques, and machine learning methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show performance improvements for clustering, and anomaly detection through the use of structural similarity."}
{"text": "Most methods for decision-theoretic online learning are based on the Hedge algorithm, which takes a parameter called the learning rate. In most previous analyses the learning rate was carefully tuned to obtain optimal worst-case performance, leading to suboptimal performance on easy instances, for example when there exists an action that is significantly better than all others. We propose a new way of setting the learning rate, which adapts to the difficulty of the learning problem: in the worst case our procedure still guarantees optimal performance, but on easy instances it achieves much smaller regret. In particular, our adaptive method achieves constant regret in a probabilistic setting, when there exists an action that on average obtains strictly smaller loss than all other actions. We also provide a simulation study comparing our approach to existing methods."}
{"text": "The popular cubic smoothing spline estimate of a regression function arises as the minimizer of the penalized sum of squares $\\sum_j(Y_j - {\\mu}(t_j))^2 + {\\lambda}\\int_a^b [{\\mu}\"(t)]^2 dt$, where the data are $t_j,Y_j$, $j=1,..., n$. The minimization is taken over an infinite-dimensional function space, the space of all functions with square integrable second derivatives. But the calculations can be carried out in a finite-dimensional space. The reduction from minimizing over an infinite dimensional space to minimizing over a finite dimensional space occurs for more general objective functions: the data may be related to the function ${\\mu}$ in another way, the sum of squares may be replaced by a more suitable expression, or the penalty, $\\int_a^b [{\\mu}\"(t)]^2 dt$, might take a different form. This paper reviews the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space structure that provides a finite-dimensional solution for a general minimization problem. Particular attention is paid to penalties based on linear differential operators. In this case, one can sometimes easily calculate the minimizer explicitly, using Green's functions."}
{"text": "Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a fundamental measure of the generalization capacity of learning algorithms. However, apart from a few special cases, it is hard or impossible to calculate analytically. Vapnik et al. [10] proposed a technique for estimating the VC dimension empirically. While their approach behaves well in simulations, it could not be used to bound the generalization risk of classifiers, because there were no bounds for the estimation error of the VC dimension itself. We rectify this omission, providing high probability concentration results for the proposed estimator and deriving corresponding generalization bounds."}
{"text": "In this paper, we give a new generalization error bound of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) for a general class of regularizations, and discuss what kind of regularization gives a favorable predictive accuracy. Our main target in this paper is dense type regularizations including \\ellp-MKL. According to the recent numerical experiments, the sparse regularization does not necessarily show a good performance compared with dense type regularizations. Motivated by this fact, this paper gives a general theoretical tool to derive fast learning rates of MKL that is applicable to arbitrary mixed-norm-type regularizations in a unifying manner. This enables us to compare the generalization performances of various types of regularizations. As a consequence, we observe that the homogeneity of the complexities of candidate reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) affects which regularization strategy (\\ell1 or dense) is preferred. In fact, in homogeneous complexity settings where the complexities of all RKHSs are evenly same, \\ell1-regularization is optimal among all isotropic norms. On the other hand, in inhomogeneous complexity settings, dense type regularizations can show better learning rate than sparse \\ell1-regularization. We also show that our learning rate achieves the minimax lower bound in homogeneous complexity settings."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the problem of segmenting a time-series with respect to changes in the mean value or in the variance. The first case is when the time data is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random variables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The main assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the task is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments. The second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can change. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and we want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments. To find solutions to these problems, we will study an l_1 regularized maximum likelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l_1 trend filtering, where the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To penalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l_1-norm of the time difference of the parameters is used as a regularization term. This idea is closely related to total variation denoising. The main contribution is that a convex formulation of this variance estimation problem, where the parametrization is based on the inverse of the variance, can be formulated as a certain l_1 mean estimation problem. This implies that results and methods for mean estimation can be applied to the challenging problem of variance segmentation/estimation."}
{"text": "We consider a standard binary classification problem. The performance of any binary classifier based on the training data is characterized by the excess risk. We study Bahadur's type exponential bounds on the minimax accuracy confidence function based on the excess risk. We study how this quantity depends on the complexity of the class of distributions characterized by exponents of entropies of the class of regression functions or of the class of Bayes classifiers corresponding to the distributions from the class. We also study its dependence on margin parameters of the classification problem."}
{"text": "Gaussian process models -also called Kriging models- are often used as mathematical approximations of expensive experiments. However, the number of observation required for building an emulator becomes unrealistic when using classical covariance kernels when the dimension of input increases. In oder to get round the curse of dimensionality, a popular approach is to consider simplified models such as additive models. The ambition of the present work is to give an insight into covariance kernels that are well suited for building additive Kriging models and to describe some properties of the resulting models."}
{"text": "We describe many vantage points on the Baire metric and its use in clustering data, or its use in preprocessing and structuring data in order to support search and retrieval operations. In some cases, we proceed directly to clusters and do not directly determine the distances. We show how a hierarchical clustering can be read directly from one pass through the data. We offer insights also on practical implications of precision of data measurement. As a mechanism for treating multidimensional data, including very high dimensional data, we use random projections."}
{"text": "While Gaussian probability densities are omnipresent in applied mathematics, Gaussian cumulative probabilities are hard to calculate in any but the univariate case. We study the utility of Expectation Propagation (EP) as an approximate integration method for this problem. For rectangular integration regions, the approximation is highly accurate. We also extend the derivations to the more general case of polyhedral integration regions. However, we find that in this polyhedral case, EP's answer, though often accurate, can be almost arbitrarily wrong. We consider these unexpected results empirically and theoretically, both for the problem of Gaussian probabilities and for EP more generally. These results elucidate an interesting and non-obvious feature of EP not yet studied in detail."}
{"text": "Information-maximization clustering learns a probabilistic classifier in an unsupervised manner so that mutual information between feature vectors and cluster assignments is maximized. A notable advantage of this approach is that it only involves continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially easier to solve than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve non-convex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this paper, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "The asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic approximation of Benaim, Hofbauer and Sorin is extended for asynchronous stochastic approximations with a set-valued mean field. The asynchronicity of the process is incorporated into the mean field to produce convergence results which remain similar to those of an equivalent synchronous process. In addition, this allows many of the restrictive assumptions previously associated with asynchronous stochastic approximation to be removed. The framework is extended for a coupled asynchronous stochastic approximation process with set-valued mean fields. Two-timescales arguments are used here in a similar manner to the original work in this area by Borkar. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through learning in a Markov decision process."}
{"text": "Exact inference in the linear regression model with spike and slab priors is often intractable. Expectation propagation (EP) can be used for approximate inference. However, the regular sequential form of EP (R-EP) may fail to converge in this model when the size of the training set is very small. As an alternative, we propose a provably convergent EP algorithm (PC-EP). PC-EP is proved to minimize an energy function which, under some constraints, is bounded from below and whose stationary points coincide with the solution of R-EP. Experiments with synthetic data indicate that when R-EP does not converge, the approximation generated by PC-EP is often better. By contrast, when R-EP converges, both methods perform similarly."}
{"text": "Unbalanced data arises in many learning tasks such as clustering of multi-class data, hierarchical divisive clustering and semisupervised learning. Graph-based approaches are popular tools for these problems. Graph construction is an important aspect of graph-based learning. We show that graph-based algorithms can fail for unbalanced data for many popular graphs such as k-NN, \\epsilon-neighborhood and full-RBF graphs. We propose a novel graph construction technique that encodes global statistical information into node degrees through a ranking scheme. The rank of a data sample is an estimate of its p-value and is proportional to the total number of data samples with smaller density. This ranking scheme serves as a surrogate for density; can be reliably estimated; and indicates whether a data sample is close to valleys/modes. This rank-modulated degree(RMD) scheme is able to significantly sparsify the graph near valleys and provides an adaptive way to cope with unbalanced data. We then theoretically justify our method through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method."}
{"text": "In this article, we have proposed several approaches for post processing a large ensemble of prediction models or rules. The results from our simulations show that the post processing methods we have considered here are promising. We have used the techniques developed here for estimation of quantitative traits from markers, on the benchmark \"Bostob Housing\"data set and in some simulations. In most cases, the produced models had better prediction performance than, for example, the ones produced by the random forest or the rulefit algorithms."}
{"text": "This paper is devoted to regret lower bounds in the classical model of stochastic multi-armed bandit. A well-known result of Lai and Robbins, which has then been extended by Burnetas and Katehakis, has established the presence of a logarithmic bound for all consistent policies. We relax the notion of consistence, and exhibit a generalisation of the logarithmic bound. We also show the non existence of logarithmic bound in the general case of Hannan consistency. To get these results, we study variants of popular Upper Confidence Bounds (ucb) policies. As a by-product, we prove that it is impossible to design an adaptive policy that would select the best of two algorithms by taking advantage of the properties of the environment."}
{"text": "This paper develops a general theoretical framework to analyze structured sparse recovery problems using the notation of dual certificate. Although certain aspects of the dual certificate idea have already been used in some previous work, due to the lack of a general and coherent theory, the analysis has so far only been carried out in limited scopes for specific problems. In this context the current paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a general definition of dual certificate, which we then use to develop a unified theory of sparse recovery analysis for convex programming. Second, we present a class of structured sparsity regularization called structured Lasso for which calculations can be readily performed under our theoretical framework. This new theory includes many seemingly loosely related previous work as special cases; it also implies new results that improve existing ones even for standard formulations such as L1 regularization."}
{"text": "In many situations where the interest lies in identifying clusters one might expect that not all available variables carry information about these groups. Furthermore, data quality (e.g. outliers or missing entries) might present a serious and sometimes hard-to-assess problem for large and complex datasets. In this paper we show that a small proportion of atypical observations might have serious adverse effects on the solutions found by the sparse clustering algorithm of Witten and Tibshirani (2010). We propose a robustification of their sparse K-means algorithm based on the trimmed K-means algorithm of Cuesta-Albertos et al. (1997) Our proposal is also able to handle datasets with missing values. We illustrate the use of our method on microarray data for cancer patients where we are able to identify strong biological clusters with a much reduced number of genes. Our simulation studies show that, when there are outliers in the data, our robust sparse K-means algorithm performs better than other competing methods both in terms of the selection of features and also the identified clusters. This robust sparse K-means algorithm is implemented in the R package RSKC which is publicly available from the CRAN repository."}
{"text": "Many modern data mining applications are concerned with the analysis of datasets in which the observations are described by paired high-dimensional vectorial representations or \"views\". Some typical examples can be found in web mining and genomics applications. In this article we present an algorithm for data clustering with multiple views, Multi-View Predictive Partitioning (MVPP), which relies on a novel criterion of predictive similarity between data points. We assume that, within each cluster, the dependence between multivariate views can be modelled by using a two-block partial least squares (TB-PLS) regression model, which performs dimensionality reduction and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional settings. The proposed MVPP algorithm partitions the data such that the within-cluster predictive ability between views is maximised. The proposed objective function depends on a measure of predictive influence of points under the TB-PLS model which has been derived as an extension of the PRESS statistic commonly used in ordinary least squares regression. Using simulated data, we compare the performance of MVPP to that of competing multi-view clustering methods which rely upon geometric structures of points, but ignore the predictive relationship between the two views. State-of-art results are obtained on benchmark web mining datasets."}
{"text": "We propose a new yet natural algorithm for learning the graph structure of general discrete graphical models (a.k.a. Markov random fields) from samples. Our algorithm finds the neighborhood of a node by sequentially adding nodes that produce the largest reduction in empirical conditional entropy; it is greedy in the sense that the choice of addition is based only on the reduction achieved at that iteration. Its sequential nature gives it a lower computational complexity as compared to other existing comparison-based techniques, all of which involve exhaustive searches over every node set of a certain size. Our main result characterizes the sample complexity of this procedure, as a function of node degrees, graph size and girth in factor-graph representation. We subsequently specialize this result to the case of Ising models, where we provide a simple transparent characterization of sample complexity as a function of model and graph parameters.   For tree graphs, our algorithm is the same as the classical Chow-Liu algorithm, and in that sense can be considered the extension of the same to graphs with cycles."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose a semiparametric approach, named nonparanormal skeptic, for efficiently and robustly estimating high dimensional undirected graphical models. To achieve modeling flexibility, we consider Gaussian Copula graphical models (or the nonparanormal) as proposed by Liu et al. (2009). To achieve estimation robustness, we exploit nonparametric rank-based correlation coefficient estimators, including Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. In high dimensional settings, we prove that the nonparanormal skeptic achieves the optimal parametric rate of convergence in both graph and parameter estimation. This celebrating result suggests that the Gaussian copula graphical models can be used as a safe replacement of the popular Gaussian graphical models, even when the data are truly Gaussian. Besides theoretical analysis, we also conduct thorough numerical simulations to compare different estimators for their graph recovery performance under both ideal and noisy settings. The proposed methods are then applied on a large-scale genomic dataset to illustrate their empirical usefulness. The R language software package huge implementing the proposed methods is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran. r-project.org/."}
{"text": "High-dimensional tensors or multi-way data are becoming prevalent in areas such as biomedical imaging, chemometrics, networking and bibliometrics. Traditional approaches to finding lower dimensional representations of tensor data include flattening the data and applying matrix factorizations such as principal components analysis (PCA) or employing tensor decompositions such as the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions. The former can lose important structure in the data, while the latter Higher-Order PCA (HOPCA) methods can be problematic in high-dimensions with many irrelevant features. We introduce frameworks for sparse tensor factorizations or Sparse HOPCA based on heuristic algorithmic approaches and by solving penalized optimization problems related to the CP decomposition. Extensions of these approaches lead to methods for general regularized tensor factorizations, multi-way Functional HOPCA and generalizations of HOPCA for structured data. We illustrate the utility of our methods for dimension reduction, feature selection, and signal recovery on simulated data and multi-dimensional microarrays and functional MRIs."}
{"text": "Properties of data are frequently seen to vary depending on the sampled situations, which usually changes along a time evolution or owing to environmental effects. One way to analyze such data is to find invariances, or representative features kept constant over changes. The aim of this paper is to identify one such feature, namely interactions or dependencies among variables that are common across multiple datasets collected under different conditions. To that end, we propose a common substructure learning (CSSL) framework based on a graphical Gaussian model. We further present a simple learning algorithm based on the Dual Augmented Lagrangian and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. We confirm the performance of CSSL over other existing techniques in finding unchanging dependency structures in multiple datasets through numerical simulations on synthetic data and through a real world application to anomaly detection in automobile sensors."}
{"text": "In several application domains, high-dimensional observations are collected and then analysed in search for naturally occurring data clusters which might provide further insights about the nature of the problem. In this paper we describe a new approach for partitioning such high-dimensional data. Our assumption is that, within each cluster, the data can be approximated well by a linear subspace estimated by means of a principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed algorithm, Predictive Subspace Clustering (PSC) partitions the data into clusters while simultaneously estimating cluster-wise PCA parameters. The algorithm minimises an objective function that depends upon a new measure of influence for PCA models. A penalised version of the algorithm is also described for carrying our simultaneous subspace clustering and variable selection. The convergence of PSC is discussed in detail, and extensive simulation results and comparisons to competing methods are presented. The comparative performance of PSC has been assessed on six real gene expression data sets for which PSC often provides state-of-art results."}
{"text": "We present an alternating augmented Lagrangian method for convex optimization problems where the cost function is the sum of two terms, one that is separable in the variable blocks, and a second that is separable in the difference between consecutive variable blocks. Examples of such problems include Fused Lasso estimation, total variation denoising, and multi-period portfolio optimization with transaction costs. In each iteration of our method, the first step involves separately optimizing over each variable block, which can be carried out in parallel. The second step is not separable in the variables, but can be carried out very efficiently. We apply the algorithm to segmentation of data based on changes inmean (l_1 mean filtering) or changes in variance (l_1 variance filtering). In a numerical example, we show that our implementation is around 10000 times faster compared with the generic optimization solver SDPT3."}
{"text": "Regularized kernel methods such as, e.g., support vector machines and least-squares support vector regression constitute an important class of standard learning algorithms in machine learning. Theoretical investigations concerning asymptotic properties have manly focused on rates of convergence during the last years but there are only very few and limited (asymptotic) results on statistical inference so far. As this is a serious limitation for their use in mathematical statistics, the goal of the article is to fill this gap. Based on asymptotic normality of many of these methods, the article derives a strongly consistent estimator for the unknown covariance matrix of the limiting normal distribution. In this way, we obtain asymptotically correct confidence sets for $\\psi(f_{P,\\lambda_0})$ where $f_{P,\\lambda_0}$ denotes the minimizer of the regularized risk in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ and $\\psi:H\\rightarrow\\mathds{R}^m$ is any Hadamard-differentiable functional. Applications include (multivariate) pointwise confidence sets for values of $f_{P,\\lambda_0}$ and confidence sets for gradients, integrals, and norms."}

{"text": "We introduce a new discriminant analysis method (Empirical Discriminant Analysis or EDA) for binary classification in machine learning. Given a dataset of feature vectors, this method defines an empirical feature map transforming the training and test data into new data with components having Gaussian empirical distributions. This map is an empirical version of the Gaussian copula used in probability and mathematical finance. The purpose is to form a feature mapped dataset as close as possible to Gaussian, after which standard quadratic discriminants can be used for classification. We discuss this method in general, and apply it to some datasets in computational biology."}
{"text": "Existing methods for sparse channel estimation typically provide an estimate computed as the solution maximizing an objective function defined as the sum of the log-likelihood function and a penalization term proportional to the l1-norm of the parameter of interest. However, other penalization terms have proven to have strong sparsity-inducing properties. In this work, we design pilot-assisted channel estimators for OFDM wireless receivers within the framework of sparse Bayesian learning by defining hierarchical Bayesian prior models that lead to sparsity-inducing penalization terms. The estimators result as an application of the variational message-passing algorithm on the factor graph representing the signal model extended with the hierarchical prior models. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our channel estimators as compared to traditional and state-of-the-art sparse methods."}
{"text": "We consider to learn a causal ordering of variables in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model called LiNGAM. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But, the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions actually are violated. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data."}
{"text": "Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their use of hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditional class probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherence functions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hinge function. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropy principle and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hinge function and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of the coherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, and the limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of the expected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence function in large-margin classification as C-learning, and we present efficient coordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized ${\\cal C}$-learning models."}

We show how relevant geometric and topological properties of a set can be studied analytically using concepts from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A new kind of reproducing kernel, that we call separating kernel, plays a crucial role in our study and is analyzed in detail. We prove a new analytic characterization of the support of a distribution, that naturally leads to a family of provably consistent regularized learning algorithms and we discuss the stability of these methods with respect to random sampling. Numerical experiments show that the approach is competitive, and often better, than other state of the art techniques."}
{"text": "High-dimensional data common in genomics, proteomics, and chemometrics often contains complicated correlation structures. Recently, partial least squares (PLS) and Sparse PLS methods have gained attention in these areas as dimension reduction techniques in the context of supervised data analysis. We introduce a framework for Regularized PLS by solving a relaxation of the SIMPLS optimization problem with penalties on the PLS loadings vectors. Our approach enjoys many advantages including flexibility, general penalties, easy interpretation of results, and fast computation in high-dimensional settings. We also outline extensions of our methods leading to novel methods for Non-negative PLS and Generalized PLS, an adaption of PLS for structured data. We demonstrate the utility of our methods through simulations and a case study on proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data."}
{"text": "In this paper, we study statistical properties of semi-supervised learning, which is considered as an important problem in the community of machine learning. In the standard supervised learning, only the labeled data is observed. The classification and regression problems are formalized as the supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is also obtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data is important to improve the prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. This problems is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data. Under the the discriminative probabilistic models, it had been considered that the unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy. Recently, it was revealed that the weighted estimator using the unlabeled data achieves better prediction accuracy in comparison to the learning method using only labeled data, especially when the discriminative probabilistic model is misspecified. That is, the improvement under the semiparametric model with missing data is possible, when the semiparametric model is misspecified. In this paper, we apply the density-ratio estimator to obtain the weight function in the semi-supervised learning. The benefit of our approach is that the proposed estimator does not require well-specified probabilistic models for the probability of the unlabeled data. Based on the statistical asymptotic theory, we prove that the estimation accuracy of our method outperforms the supervised learning using only labeled data. Some numerical experiments present the usefulness of our methods."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we define such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. These properties lead us to EM algorithms for Bayesian sparse learning. We show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively re-weighted $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_1$ methods. In addition, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression."}

Our model is appropriate for modeling non-i.i.d. data and offers a substantial reduction of computational cost when compared to the original sampler without resorting to approximations. We also propose a quadratic complexity approximation that in practice shows almost no loss in performance compared to its counterpart. We show that as a byproduct of our formulation, we obtain a greedy algorithm that exhibits performance improvement over other greedy algorithms, particularly in small data sets. In order to exploit the correlation structure of the data, we describe how to incorporate Gaussian process priors in the model as a flexible way to model non-i.i.d. data. Results on artificial and real data show significant improvements over closely related approaches."}
{"text": "We consider the structure learning problem for graphical models that we call loosely connected Markov random fields, in which the number of short paths between any pair of nodes is small, and present a new conditional independence test based algorithm for learning the underlying graph structure. The novel maximization step in our algorithm ensures that the true edges are detected correctly even when there are short cycles in the graph. The number of samples required by our algorithm is C*log p, where p is the size of the graph and the constant C depends on the parameters of the model. We show that several previously studied models are examples of loosely connected Markov random fields, and our algorithm achieves the same or lower computational complexity than the previously designed algorithms for individual cases. We also get new results for more general graphical models, in particular, our algorithm learns general Ising models on the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(p, c/p) correctly with running time O(np^5)."}

{"text": "Hierarchical parametric models consisting of observable and latent variables are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. For example, a mixture model is a representative hierarchical model for clustering. From the statistical point of view, the models can be regular or singular due to the distribution of data. In the regular case, the models have the identifiability; there is one-to-one relation between a probability density function for the model expression and the parameter. The Fisher information matrix is positive definite, and the estimation accuracy of both observable and latent variables has been studied. In the singular case, on the other hand, the models are not identifiable and the Fisher matrix is not positive definite. Conventional statistical analysis based on the inverse Fisher matrix is not applicable. Recently, an algebraic geometrical analysis has been developed and is used to elucidate the Bayes estimation of observable variables. The present paper applies this analysis to latent-variable estimation and determines its theoretical performance. Our results clarify behavior of the convergence of the posterior distribution. It is found that the posterior of the observable-variable estimation can be different from the one in the latent-variable estimation. Because of the difference, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on the parameter and the latent variable cannot construct the desired posterior distribution."}
{"text": "This paper considers the problem of robust subspace recovery: given a set of $N$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, if many lie in a $d$-dimensional subspace, then can we recover the underlying subspace? We show that Tyler's M-estimator can be used to recover the underlying subspace, if the percentage of the inliers is larger than $d/D$ and the data points lie in general position. Empirically, Tyler's M-estimator compares favorably with other convex subspace recovery algorithms in both simulations and experiments on real data sets."}
{"text": "A mixture of Gaussians fit to a single curved or heavy-tailed cluster will report that the data contains many clusters. To produce more appropriate clusterings, we introduce a model which warps a latent mixture of Gaussians to produce nonparametric cluster shapes. The possibly low-dimensional latent mixture model allows us to summarize the properties of the high-dimensional clusters (or density manifolds) describing the data. The number of manifolds, as well as the shape and dimension of each manifold is automatically inferred. We derive a simple inference scheme for this model which analytically integrates out both the mixture parameters and the warping function. We show that our model is effective for density estimation, performs better than infinite Gaussian mixture models at recovering the true number of clusters, and produces interpretable summaries of high-dimensional datasets."}
{"text": "We compute the expected value of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to various fundamental statistical models with respect to canonical priors on the probability simplex. We obtain closed formulas for the expected model approximation errors, depending on the dimension of the models and the cardinalities of their sample spaces. For the uniform prior, the expected divergence from any model containing the uniform distribution is bounded by a constant $1-\\gamma$, and for the models that we consider, this bound is approached if the state space is very large and the models' dimension does not grow too fast. For Dirichlet priors the expected divergence is bounded in a similar way, if the concentration parameters take reasonable values.

The challenges with the multiclass GP classification are the integration over the non-Gaussian posterior distribution, and the increase of the number of unknown latent variables as the number of target classes grows. Expectation propagation (EP) has proven to be a very accurate method for approximate inference but the existing EP approaches for the multinomial probit GP classification rely on numerical quadratures or independence assumptions between the latent values from different classes to facilitate the computations. In this paper, we propose a novel nested EP approach which does not require numerical quadratures, and approximates accurately all between-class posterior dependencies of the latent values, but still scales linearly in the number of classes. The predictive accuracy of the nested EP approach is compared to Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximations with various benchmark data sets. In the experiments nested EP was the most consistent method with respect to MCMC sampling, but the differences between the compared methods were small if only the classification accuracy is concerned."}
{"text": "Case vs control comparisons have been the classical approach to the study of neurological diseases. However, most patients will not fall cleanly into either group. Instead, clinicians will typically find patients that cannot be classified as having clearly progressed into the disease state. For those subjects, very little can be said about their brain function on the basis of analyses of group differences. To describe the intermediate brain function requires models that interpolate between the disease states. We have chosen Gaussian Processes (GP) regression to obtain a continuous spectrum of brain activation and to extract the unknown disease progression profile. Our models incorporate spatial distribution of measures of activation, e.g. the correlation of an fMRI trace with an input stimulus, and so constitute ultra-high multi-variate GP regressors. We applied GPs to model fMRI image phenotypes across Alzheimer's Disease (AD) behavioural measures, e.g. MMSE, ACE etc. scores, and obtained predictions at non-observed MMSE/ACE values. The overall model confirmed the known reduction in the spatial extent of activity in response to reading versus false-font stimulation. The predictive uncertainty indicated the worsening confidence intervals at behavioural scores distance from those used for GP training. Thus, the model indicated the type of patient (what behavioural score) that would need to included in the training data to improve models predictions."}
{"text": "Recently, sparsity-based algorithms are proposed for super-resolution spectrum estimation. However, to achieve adequately high resolution in real-world signal analysis, the dictionary atoms have to be close to each other in frequency, thereby resulting in a coherent design. The popular convex compressed sensing methods break down in presence of high coherence and large noise. We propose a new regularization approach to handle model collinearity and obtain parsimonious frequency selection simultaneously. It takes advantage of the pairing structure of sine and cosine atoms in the frequency dictionary. A probabilistic spectrum screening is also developed for fast computation in high dimensions. A data-resampling version of high-dimensional Bayesian Information Criterion is used to determine the regularization parameters. Experiments show the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms in challenging situations with small sample size, high frequency resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratio."}
{"text": "A very important topic in systems biology is developing statistical methods that automatically find causal relations in gene regulatory networks with no prior knowledge of causal connectivity. Many methods have been developed for time series data. However, discovery methods based on steady-state data are often necessary and preferable since obtaining time series data can be more expensive and/or infeasible for many biological systems. A conventional approach is causal Bayesian networks. However, estimation of Bayesian networks is ill-posed. In many cases it cannot uniquely identify the underlying causal network and only gives a large class of equivalent causal networks that cannot be distinguished between based on the data distribution. We propose a new discovery algorithm for uniquely identifying the underlying causal network of genes. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first algorithm for learning gene networks based on a fully identifiable causal model called LiNGAM. We here compare our algorithm with competing algorithms using artificially-generated data, although it is definitely better to test it based on real microarray gene expression data."}
{"text": "A single, stationary topic model such as latent Dirichlet allocation is inappropriate for modeling corpora that span long time periods, as the popularity of topics is likely to change over time. A number of models that incorporate time have been proposed, but in general they either exhibit limited forms of temporal variation, or require computationally expensive inference methods. In this paper we propose non-parametric Topics over Time (npTOT), a model for time-varying topics that allows an unbounded number of topics and exible distribution over the temporal variations in those topics' popularity. We develop a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the proposed model and compare against existing models on synthetic and real document sets."}
{"text": "Maximum Variance Unfolding is one of the main methods for (nonlinear) dimensionality reduction. We study its large sample limit, providing specific rates of convergence under standard assumptions. We find that it is consistent when the underlying submanifold is isometric to a convex subset, and we provide some simple examples where it fails to be consistent."}
{"text": "Given two graphs, the graph matching problem is to align the two vertex sets so as to minimize the number of adjacency disagreements between the two graphs. The seeded graph matching problem is the graph matching problem when we are first given a partial alignment that we are tasked with completing. In this paper, we modify the state-of-the-art approximate graph matching algorithm \"FAQ\" of Vogelstein et al. (2015) to make it a fast approximate seeded graph matching algorithm, adapt its applicability to include graphs with differently sized vertex sets, and extend the algorithm so as to provide, for each individual vertex, a nomination list of likely matches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via simulation and real data experiments; indeed, knowledge of even a few seeds can be extremely effective when our seeded graph matching algorithm is used to recover a naturally existing alignment that is only partially observed."}
{"text": "We offer a novel view of AdaBoost in a statistical setting. We propose a Bayesian model for binary classification in which label noise is modeled hierarchically. Using variational inference to optimize a dynamic evidence lower bound, we derive a new boosting-like algorithm called VIBoost. We show its close connections to AdaBoost and give experimental results from four datasets."}
{"text": "In the paper, we consider the problem of link prediction in time-evolving graphs. We assume that certain graph features, such as the node degree, follow a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and we propose to use this information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Our strategy involves a joint optimization procedure over the space of adjacency matrices and VAR matrices which takes into account both sparsity and low rank properties of the matrices. Oracle inequalities are derived and illustrate the trade-offs in the choice of smoothing parameters when modeling the joint effect of sparsity and low rank property. The estimate is computed efficiently using proximal methods through a generalized forward-backward agorithm."}
{"text": "We consider the problems of detection and localization of a contiguous block of weak activation in a large matrix, from a small number of noisy, possibly adaptive, compressive (linear) measurements. This is closely related to the problem of compressed sensing, where the task is to estimate a sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements. Contrary to results in compressed sensing, where it has been shown that neither adaptivity nor contiguous structure help much, we show that for reliable localization the magnitude of the weakest signals is strongly influenced by both structure and the ability to choose measurements adaptively while for detection neither adaptivity nor structure reduce the requirement on the magnitude of the signal. We characterize the precise tradeoffs between the various problem parameters, the signal strength and the number of measurements required to reliably detect and localize the block of activation. The sufficient conditions are complemented with information theoretic lower bounds."}
{"text": "Exact Gaussian Process (GP) regression has O(N^3) runtime for data size N, making it intractable for large N. Many algorithms for improving GP scaling approximate the covariance with lower rank matrices. Other work has exploited structure inherent in particular covariance functions, including GPs with implied Markov structure, and equispaced inputs (both enable O(N) runtime). However, these GP advances have not been extended to the multidimensional input setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional applications. This paper introduces and tests novel extensions of structured GPs to multidimensional inputs. We present new methods for additive GPs, showing a novel connection between the classic backfitting method and the Bayesian framework. To achieve optimal accuracy-complexity tradeoff, we extend this model with a novel variant of projection pursuit regression. Our primary result -- projection pursuit Gaussian Process Regression -- shows orders of magnitude speedup while preserving high accuracy. The natural second and third steps include non-Gaussian observations and higher dimensional equispaced grid methods. We introduce novel techniques to address both of these necessary directions. We thoroughly illustrate the power of these three advances on several datasets, achieving close performance to the naive Full GP at orders of magnitude less cost."}
{"text": "Mean-field variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-field methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest---like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression---are nonconjuate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression."}
{"text": "Typical cohorts in brain imaging studies are not large enough for systematic testing of all the information contained in the images. To build testable working hypotheses, investigators thus rely on analysis of previous work, sometimes formalized in a so-called meta-analysis. In brain imaging, this approach underlies the specification of regions of interest (ROIs) that are usually selected on the basis of the coordinates of previously detected effects. In this paper, we propose to use a database of images, rather than coordinates, and frame the problem as transfer learning: learning a discriminant model on a reference task to apply it to a different but related new task. To facilitate statistical analysis of small cohorts, we use a sparse discriminant model that selects predictive voxels on the reference task and thus provides a principled procedure to define ROIs. The benefits of our approach are twofold. First it uses the reference database for prediction, i.e. to provide potential biomarkers in a clinical setting. Second it increases statistical power on the new task. We demonstrate on a set of 18 pairs of functional MRI experimental conditions that our approach gives good prediction. In addition, on a specific transfer situation involving different scanners at different locations, we show that voxel selection based on transfer learning leads to higher detection power on small cohorts."}
{"text": "Many applications in data analysis rely on the decomposition of a data matrix into a low-rank and a sparse component. Existing methods that tackle this task use the nuclear norm and L1-cost functions as convex relaxations of the rank constraint and the sparsity measure, respectively, or employ thresholding techniques. We propose a method that allows for reconstructing and tracking a subspace of upper-bounded dimension from incomplete and corrupted observations. It does not require any a priori information about the number of outliers. The core of our algorithm is an intrinsic Conjugate Gradient method on the set of orthogonal projection matrices, the so-called Grassmannian. Non-convex sparsity measures are used for outlier detection, which leads to improved performance in terms of robustly recovering and tracking the low-rank matrix. In particular, our approach can cope with more outliers and with an underlying matrix of higher rank than other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Graph clustering involves the task of dividing nodes into clusters, so that the edge density is higher within clusters as opposed to across clusters. A natural, classic and popular statistical setting for evaluating solutions to this problem is the stochastic block model, also referred to as the planted partition model.   In this paper we present a new algorithm--a convexified version of Maximum Likelihood--for graph clustering. We show that, in the classic stochastic block model setting, it outperforms existing methods by polynomial factors when the cluster size is allowed to have general scalings. In fact, it is within logarithmic factors of known lower bounds for spectral methods, and there is evidence suggesting that no polynomial time algorithm would do significantly better.   We then show that this guarantee carries over to a more general extension of the stochastic block model. Our method can handle the settings of semi-random graphs, heterogeneous degree distributions, unequal cluster sizes, unaffiliated nodes, partially observed graphs and planted clique/coloring etc. In particular, our results provide the best exact recovery guarantees to date for the planted partition, planted k-disjoint-cliques and planted noisy coloring models with general cluster sizes; in other settings, we match the best existing results up to logarithmic factors."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a differentiable function given a finite number of evaluations to the function. We construct a sampling scheme that samples more often in regions where the function oscillates more, while allocating the samples such that they are well spread on the domain (this notion shares similitude with low discrepancy). We prove that the estimate returned by the algorithm is almost similarly accurate as the estimate that an optimal oracle strategy (that would know the variations of the function everywhere) would return, and provide a finite-sample analysis."}
{"text": "Multi-task sparse feature learning aims to improve the generalization performance by exploiting the shared features among tasks. It has been successfully applied to many applications including computer vision and biomedical informatics. Most of the existing multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms are formulated as a convex sparse regularization problem, which is usually suboptimal, due to its looseness for approximating an $\\ell_0$-type regularizer. In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation for multi-task sparse feature learning based on a novel non-convex regularizer. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning (MSMTFL) algorithm; we also provide intuitive interpretations, detailed convergence and reproducibility analysis for the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we present a detailed theoretical analysis showing that MSMTFL achieves a better parameter estimation error bound than the convex formulation. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMTFL in comparison with the state of the art multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms."}
{"text": "Many real world network problems often concern multivariate nodal attributes such as image, textual, and multi-view feature vectors on nodes, rather than simple univariate nodal attributes. The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating graphs from multi-attribute data. Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features. Computationally, we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure. Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under various conditions. Furthermore, we provide illustrative applications to uncovering gene regulatory networks from gene and protein profiles, and uncovering brain connectivity graph from functional magnetic resonance imaging data."}
{"text": "Given a time series of graphs G(t) = (V, E(t)), t = 1, 2, ..., where the fixed vertex set V represents \"actors\" and an edge between vertex u and vertex v at time t (uv \\in E(t)) represents the existence of a communications event between actors u and v during the tth time period, we wish to detect anomalies and/or change points. We consider a collection of graph features, or invariants, and demonstrate that adaptive fusion provides superior inferential efficacy compared to naive equal weighting for a certain class of anomaly detection problems. Simulation results using a latent process model for time series of graphs, as well as illustrative experimental results for a time series of graphs derived from the Enron email data, show that a fusion statistic can provide superior inference compared to individual invariants alone. These results also demonstrate that an adaptive weighting scheme for fusion of invariants performs better than naive equal weighting."}
{"text": "We study the mixtures of factorizing probability distributions represented as visible marginal distributions in stochastic layered networks. We take the perspective of kernel transitions of distributions, which gives a unified picture of distributed representations arising from Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and other networks without lateral connections. We describe combinatorial and geometric properties of the set of kernels and products of kernels realizable by DBNs as the network parameters vary. We describe explicit classes of probability distributions, including exponential families, that can be learned by DBNs. We use these submodels to bound the maximal and the expected Kullback-Leibler approximation errors of DBNs from above depending on the number of hidden layers and units that they contain."}
{"text": "We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a fully Bayesian treatment and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as different kernels. Kernel functions have been introduced to matrix factorization to integrate side information about the rows and columns (e.g., objects and users in recommender systems), which is necessary for making out-of-matrix (i.e., cold start) predictions. We discuss specifically bipartite graph inference, where the output matrix is binary, but extensions to more general matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A fully conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization problem enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas fully Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning that additionally reveals which side information sources are informative. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. We then show that our framework can also be used for solving multilabel learning problems by considering samples and labels as the two domains where matrix factorization operates on. Our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming loss values on 10 out of 14 multilabel classification data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms."}
{"text": "We prove that the density function of the gradient of a sufficiently smooth function $S : \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, obtained via a random variable transformation of a uniformly distributed random variable, is increasingly closely approximated by the normalized power spectrum of $\\phi=\\exp\\left(\\frac{iS}{\\tau}\\right)$ as the free parameter $\\tau \\rightarrow 0$. The result is shown using the stationary phase approximation and standard integration techniques and requires proper ordering of limits. We highlight a relationship with the well-known characteristic function approach to density estimation, and detail why our result is distinct from this approach."}
{"text": "We study inference and learning based on a sparse coding model with `spike-and-slab' prior. As in standard sparse coding, the model used assumes independent latent sources that linearly combine to generate data points. However, instead of using a standard sparse prior such as a Laplace distribution, we study the application of a more flexible `spike-and-slab' distribution which models the absence or presence of a source's contribution independently of its strength if it contributes. We investigate two approaches to optimize the parameters of spike-and-slab sparse coding: a novel truncated EM approach and, for comparison, an approach based on standard factored variational distributions. The truncated approach can be regarded as a variational approach with truncated posteriors as variational distributions. In applications to source separation we find that both approaches improve the state-of-the-art in a number of standard benchmarks, which argues for the use of `spike-and-slab' priors for the corresponding data domains. Furthermore, we find that the truncated EM approach improves on the standard factored approach in source separation tasks$-$which hints to biases introduced by assuming posterior independence in the factored variational approach. Likewise, on a standard benchmark for image denoising, we find that the truncated EM approach improves on the factored variational approach. While the performance of the factored approach saturates with increasing numbers of hidden dimensions, the performance of the truncated approach improves the state-of-the-art for higher noise levels."}
{"text": "Statistical inference on graphs is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science, engineering, business, etc. In many applications, we are faced with the reality of errorfully observed graphs. That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. We wish to perform an inference task -- the inference task considered here is \"vertex classification\". However, we do not observe $G$; rather, for each potential edge $uv \\in {{V}\\choose{2}}$ we observe an \"edge-feature\" which we use to classify $uv$ as edge/not-edge. Thus we errorfully observe $G$ when we observe the graph $\\widetilde{G} = (V,\\widetilde{E})$ as the edges in $\\widetilde{E}$ arise from the classifications of the \"edge-features\", and are expected to be errorful. Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we observe -- more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge-features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality tradeoff for a simple class of random graphs model, namely the stochastic blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for classifying $v$ and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize performance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the quantity/quality tradeoff for errorful obesrvations of the {\\it C.\\ elegans} connectome graph."}
{"text": "Many random processes can be simulated as the output of a deterministic model accepting random inputs. Such a model usually describes a complex mathematical or physical stochastic system and the randomness is introduced in the input variables of the model. When the statistics of the output event are known, these input variables have to be chosen in a specific way for the output to have the prescribed statistics. Because the probability distribution of the input random variables is not directly known but dictated implicitly by the statistics of the output random variables, this problem is usually intractable for classical sampling methods. Based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo we propose a novel method to sample random inputs to such models by introducing a modification to the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. As an example we consider a system described by a stochastic differential equation (sde) and demonstrate how sample paths of a random process satisfying this sde can be generated with our technique."}
{"text": "Nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process are an elegant alternative to finite models when the number of underlying components is unknown, but inference in such models can be slow. Existing attempts to parallelize inference in such models have relied on introducing approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the posterior estimate. In this paper, we describe auxiliary variable representations for the Dirichlet process and the hierarchical Dirichlet process that allow us to sample from the true posterior in a distributed manner. We show that our approach allows scalable inference without the deterioration in estimate quality that accompanies existing methods."}
{"text": "In this paper we prove the probabilistic continuous complexity conjecture. In continuous complexity theory, this states that the complexity of solving a continuous problem with probability approaching 1 converges (in this limit) to the complexity of solving the same problem in its worst case. We prove the conjecture holds if and only if space of problem elements is uniformly convex. The non-uniformly convex case has a striking counterexample in the problem of identifying a Brownian path in Wiener space, where it is shown that probabilistic complexity converges to only half of the worst case complexity in this limit."}
{"text": "There have lately been several suggestions for parametrized distances on a graph that generalize the shortest path distance and the commute time or resistance distance. The need for developing such distances has risen from the observation that the above-mentioned common distances in many situations fail to take into account the global structure of the graph. In this article, we develop the theory of one family of graph node distances, known as the randomized shortest path dissimilarity, which has its foundation in statistical physics. We show that the randomized shortest path dissimilarity can be easily computed in closed form for all pairs of nodes of a graph. Moreover, we come up with a new definition of a distance measure that we call the free energy distance. The free energy distance can be seen as an upgrade of the randomized shortest path dissimilarity as it defines a metric, in addition to which it satisfies the graph-geodetic property. The derivation and computation of the free energy distance are also straightforward. We then make a comparison between a set of generalized distances that interpolate between the shortest path distance and the commute time, or resistance distance. This comparison focuses on the applicability of the distances in graph node clustering and classification. The comparison, in general, shows that the parametrized distances perform well in the tasks. In particular, we see that the results obtained with the free energy distance are among the best in all the experiments."}
{"text": "Model selection is a crucial issue in machine-learning and a wide variety of penalisation methods (with possibly data dependent complexity penalties) have recently been introduced for this purpose. However their empirical performance is generally not well documented in the literature. It is the goal of this paper to investigate to which extent such recent techniques can be successfully used for the tuning of both the regularisation and kernel parameters in support vector regression (SVR) and the complexity measure in regression trees (CART). This task is traditionally solved via V-fold cross-validation (VFCV), which gives efficient results for a reasonable computational cost. A disadvantage however of VFCV is that the procedure is known to provide an asymptotically suboptimal risk estimate as the number of examples tends to infinity. Recently, a penalisation procedure called V-fold penalisation has been proposed to improve on VFCV, supported by theoretical arguments. Here we report on an extensive set of experiments comparing V-fold penalisation and VFCV for SVR/CART calibration on several benchmark datasets. We highlight cases in which VFCV and V-fold penalisation provide poor estimates of the risk respectively and introduce a modified penalisation technique to reduce the estimation error."}
{"text": "The classical mixture of Gaussians model is related to K-means via small-variance asymptotics: as the covariances of the Gaussians tend to zero, the negative log-likelihood of the mixture of Gaussians model approaches the K-means objective, and the EM algorithm approaches the K-means algorithm. Kulis & Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework."}
{"text": "We apply information-based complexity analysis to support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, with the goal of a comprehensive continuous algorithmic analysis of such algorithms. This involves complexity measures in which some higher order operations (e.g., certain optimizations) are considered primitive for the purposes of measuring complexity. We consider classes of information operators and algorithms made up of scaled families, and investigate the utility of scaling the complexities to minimize error. We look at the division of statistical learning into information and algorithmic components, at the complexities of each, and at applications to support vector machine (SVM) and more general machine learning algorithms. We give applications to SVM algorithms graded into linear and higher order components, and give an example in biomedical informatics."}
{"text": "Problems in machine learning (ML) can involve noisy input data, and ML classification methods have reached limiting accuracies when based on standard ML data sets consisting of feature vectors and their classes. Greater accuracy will require incorporation of prior structural information on data into learning. We study methods to regularize feature vectors (unsupervised regularization methods), analogous to supervised regularization for estimating functions in ML. We study regularization (denoising) of ML feature vectors using Tikhonov and other regularization methods for functions on ${\\bf R}^n$. A feature vector ${\\bf x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\{x_q\\}_{q=1}^n$ is viewed as a function of its index $q$, and smoothed using prior information on its structure. This can involve a penalty functional on feature vectors analogous to those in statistical learning, or use of proximity (e.g. graph) structure on the set of indices. Such feature vector regularization inherits a property from function denoising on ${\\bf R}^n$, in that accuracy is non-monotonic in the denoising (regularization) parameter $\\alpha$. Under some assumptions about the noise level and the data structure, we show that the best reconstruction accuracy also occurs at a finite positive $\\alpha$ in index spaces with graph structures. We adapt two standard function denoising methods used on ${\\bf R}^n$, local averaging and kernel regression. In general the index space can be any discrete set with a notion of proximity, e.g. a metric space, a subset of ${\\bf R}^n$, or a graph/network, with feature vectors as functions with some notion of continuity. We show this improves feature vector recovery, and thus the subsequent classification or regression done on them. We give an example in gene expression analysis for cancer classification with the genome as an index space and network structure based protein-protein interactions."}
{"text": "This technical note considers the problems of blind sparse learning and inference of electrogram (EGM) signals under atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions. First of all we introduce a mathematical model for the observed signals that takes into account the multiple foci typically appearing inside the heart during AF. Then we propose a reconstruction model based on a fixed dictionary and discuss several alternatives for choosing the dictionary. In order to obtain a sparse solution that takes into account the biological restrictions of the problem, a first alternative is using LASSO regularization followed by a post-processing stage that removes low amplitude coefficients violating the refractory period characteristic of cardiac cells. As an alternative we propose a novel regularization term, called cross products LASSO (CP-LASSO), that is able to incorporate the biological constraints directly into the optimization problem. Unfortunately, the resulting problem is non-convex, but we show how it can be solved efficiently in an approximated way making use of successive convex approximations (SCA). Finally, spectral analysis is performed on the clean activation sequence obtained from the sparse learning stage in order to estimate the number of latent foci and their frequencies. Simulations on synthetic and real data are provided to validate the proposed approach."}
{"text": "A new geometrically-motivated algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization is developed and applied to the discovery of latent \"topics\" for text and image \"document\" corpora. The algorithm is based on robustly finding and clustering extreme points of empirical cross-document word-frequencies that correspond to novel \"words\" unique to each topic. In contrast to related approaches that are based on solving non-convex optimization problems using suboptimal approximations, locally-optimal methods, or heuristics, the new algorithm is convex, has polynomial complexity, and has competitive qualitative and quantitative performance compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "Partitioning a graph into groups of vertices such that those within each group are more densely connected than vertices assigned to different groups, known as graph clustering, is often used to gain insight into the organisation of large scale networks and for visualisation purposes. Whereas a large number of dedicated techniques have been recently proposed for static graphs, the design of on-line graph clustering methods tailored for evolving networks is a challenging problem, and much less documented in the literature. Motivated by the broad variety of applications concerned, ranging from the study of biological networks to the analysis of networks of scientific references through the exploration of communications networks such as the World Wide Web, it is the main purpose of this paper to introduce a novel, computationally efficient, approach to graph clustering in the evolutionary context. Namely, the method promoted in this article can be viewed as an incremental eigenvalue solution for the spectral clustering method described by Ng. et al. (2001). The incremental eigenvalue solution is a general technique for finding the approximate eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix given a change. As well as outlining the approach in detail, we present a theoretical bound on the quality of the approximate eigenvectors using perturbation theory. We then derive a novel spectral clustering algorithm called Incremental Approximate Spectral Clustering (IASC). The IASC algorithm is simple to implement and its efficacy is demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets modelling the evolution of a HIV epidemic, a citation network and the purchase history graph of an e-commerce website."}
{"text": "We propose an approach to multivariate nonparametric regression that generalizes reduced rank regression for linear models. An additive model is estimated for each dimension of a $q$-dimensional response, with a shared $p$-dimensional predictor variable. To control the complexity of the model, we employ a functional form of the Ky-Fan or nuclear norm, resulting in a set of function estimates that have low rank. Backfitting algorithms are derived and justified using a nonparametric form of the nuclear norm subdifferential. Oracle inequalities on excess risk are derived that exhibit the scaling behavior of the procedure in the high dimensional setting. The methods are illustrated on gene expression data."}
{"text": "Suppose that two large, multi-dimensional data sets are each noisy measurements of the same underlying random process, and principle components analysis is performed separately on the data sets to reduce their dimensionality. In some circumstances it may happen that the two lower-dimensional data sets have an inordinately large Procrustean fitting-error between them. The purpose of this manuscript is to quantify this \"incommensurability phenomenon.\" In particular, under specified conditions, the square Procrustean fitting-error of the two normalized lower-dimensional data sets is (asymptotically) a convex combination (via a correlation parameter) of the Hausdorff distance between the projection subspaces and the maximum possible value of the square Procrustean fitting-error for normalized data. We show how this gives rise to the incommensurability phenomenon, and we employ illustrative simulations as well as a real data experiment to explore how the incommensurability phenomenon may have an appreciable impact."}
{"text": "We propose a spectral clustering method based on local principal components analysis (PCA). After performing local PCA in selected neighborhoods, the algorithm builds a nearest neighbor graph weighted according to a discrepancy between the principal subspaces in the neighborhoods, and then applies spectral clustering. As opposed to standard spectral methods based solely on pairwise distances between points, our algorithm is able to resolve intersections. We establish theoretical guarantees for simpler variants within a prototypical mathematical framework for multi-manifold clustering, and evaluate our algorithm on various simulated data sets."}
{"text": "Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference. When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian field, with the approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but intractable correction, and can be applied to the model's partition function and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP's local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to first order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP solution."}
{"text": "We develop a nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) for hierarchical topic modeling. The nHDP is a generalization of the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) that allows each word to follow its own path to a topic node according to a document-specific distribution on a shared tree. This alleviates the rigid, single-path formulation of the nCRP, allowing a document to more easily express thematic borrowings as a random effect. We demonstrate our algorithm on 1.8 million documents from The New York Times."}
{"text": "Dictionary Learning has proven to be a powerful tool for many image processing tasks, where atoms are typically defined on small image patches. As a drawback, the dictionary only encodes basic structures. In addition, this approach treats patches of different locations in one single set, which means a loss of information when features are well-aligned across signals. This is the case, for instance, in multi-trial magneto- or electroencephalography (M/EEG). Learning the dictionary on the entire signals could make use of the alignement and reveal higher-level features. In this case, however, small missalignements or phase variations of features would not be compensated for. In this paper, we propose an extension to the common dictionary learning framework to overcome these limitations by allowing atoms to adapt their position across signals. The method is validated on simulated and real neuroelectric data."}
{"text": "We study high-dimensional asymptotic performance limits of binary supervised classification problems where the class conditional densities are Gaussian with unknown means and covariances and the number of signal dimensions scales faster than the number of labeled training samples. We show that the Bayes error, namely the minimum attainable error probability with complete distributional knowledge and equally likely classes, can be arbitrarily close to zero and yet the limiting minimax error probability of every supervised learning algorithm is no better than a random coin toss. In contrast to related studies where the classification difficulty (Bayes error) is made to vanish, we hold it constant when taking high-dimensional limits. In contrast to VC-dimension based minimax lower bounds that consider the worst case error probability over all distributions that have a fixed Bayes error, our worst case is over the family of Gaussian distributions with constant Bayes error. We also show that a nontrivial asymptotic minimax error probability can only be attained for parametric subsets of zero measure (in a suitable measure space). These results expose the fundamental importance of prior knowledge and suggest that unless we impose strong structural constraints, such as sparsity, on the parametric space, supervised learning may be ineffective in high dimensional small sample settings."}
{"text": "Identifying homogeneous subgroups of variables can be challenging in high dimensional data analysis with highly correlated predictors. We propose a new method called Hexagonal Operator for Regression with Shrinkage and Equality Selection, HORSES for short, that simultaneously selects positively correlated variables and identifies them as predictive clusters. This is achieved via a constrained least-squares problem with regularization that consists of a linear combination of an L_1 penalty for the coefficients and another L_1 penalty for pairwise differences of the coefficients. This specification of the penalty function encourages grouping of positively correlated predictors combined with a sparsity solution. We construct an efficient algorithm to implement the HORSES procedure. We show via simulation that the proposed method outperforms other variable selection methods in terms of prediction error and parsimony. The technique is demonstrated on two data sets, a small data set from analysis of soil in Appalachia, and a high dimensional data set from a near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy study, showing the flexibility of the methodology."}
{"text": "It has been shown that AIC-type criteria are asymptotically efficient selectors of the tuning parameter in non-concave penalized regression methods under the assumption that the population variance is known or that a consistent estimator is available. We relax this assumption to prove that AIC itself is asymptotically efficient and we study its performance in finite samples. In classical regression, it is known that AIC tends to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same shortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of the classical corrected AIC (AICc) as an alternative and prove that it maintains the desired asymptotic properties. To broaden our results, we further prove the efficiency of AIC for penalized likelihood methods in the context of generalized linear models with no dispersion parameter. Similar results exist in the literature but only for a restricted set of candidate models. By employing results from the classical literature on maximum-likelihood estimation in misspecified models, we are able to establish this result for a general set of candidate models. We use simulations to assess the performance of AIC and AICc, as well as that of other selectors, in finite samples for both SCAD-penalized and Lasso regressions and a real data example is considered."}
{"text": "Measurements made by satellite remote sensing, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and globally distributed Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are compared. Comparison of the two datasets measurements for aerosol optical depth values show that there are biases between the two data products. In this paper, we present a general framework towards identifying relevant set of variables responsible for the observed bias. We present a general framework to identify the possible factors influencing the bias, which might be associated with the measurement conditions such as the solar and sensor zenith angles, the solar and sensor azimuth, scattering angles, and surface reflectivity at the various measured wavelengths, etc. Specifically, we performed analysis for remote sensing Aqua-Land data set, and used machine learning technique, neural network in this case, to perform multivariate regression between the ground-truth and the training data sets. Finally, we used mutual information between the observed and the predicted values as the measure of similarity to identify the most relevant set of variables. The search is brute force method as we have to consider all possible combinations. The computations involves a huge number crunching exercise, and we implemented it by writing a job-parallel program."}
{"text": "We present two graph-based algorithms for multiclass segmentation of high-dimensional data. The algorithms use a diffuse interface model based on the Ginzburg-Landau functional, related to total variation compressed sensing and image processing. A multiclass extension is introduced using the Gibbs simplex, with the functional's double-well potential modified to handle the multiclass case. The first algorithm minimizes the functional using a convex splitting numerical scheme. The second algorithm is a uses a graph adaptation of the classical numerical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, which alternates between diffusion and thresholding. We demonstrate the performance of both algorithms experimentally on synthetic data, grayscale and color images, and several benchmark data sets such as MNIST, COIL and WebKB. We also make use of fast numerical solvers for finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian, and take advantage of the sparsity of the matrix. Experiments indicate that the results are competitive with or better than the current state-of-the-art multiclass segmentation algorithms."}
{"text": "As a testament to their success, the theory of random forests has long been outpaced by their application in practice. In this paper, we take a step towards narrowing this gap by providing a consistency result for online random forests."}
{"text": "Spectral clustering (SC) and graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms are sensitive to how graphs are constructed from data. In particular if the data has proximal and unbalanced clusters these algorithms can lead to poor performance on well-known graphs such as $k$-NN, full-RBF, $\\epsilon$-graphs. This is because the objectives such as Ratio-Cut (RCut) or normalized cut (NCut) attempt to tradeoff cut values with cluster sizes, which are not tailored to unbalanced data. We propose a novel graph partitioning framework, which parameterizes a family of graphs by adaptively modulating node degrees in a $k$-NN graph. We then propose a model selection scheme to choose sizable clusters which are separated by smallest cut values. Our framework is able to adapt to varying levels of unbalancedness of data and can be naturally used for small cluster detection. We theoretically justify our ideas through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method."}
{"text": "This work develops a generic framework, called the bag-of-paths (BoP), for link and network data analysis. The central idea is to assign a probability distribution on the set of all paths in a network. More precisely, a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is defined over a bag of paths in a network, that is, on a representation that considers all paths independently. We show that, under this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes can easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion. This probability captures a notion of relatedness between nodes of the graph: two nodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many, preferably low-cost, paths. As an application, two families of distances between nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities. Interestingly, the second distance family interpolates between the shortest path distance and the resistance distance. In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for computing the shortest path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths by simply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator. Experimental results on semi-supervised classification show that both of the new distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths framework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network measures."}
{"text": "Gaussian process is a very promising novel technology that has been applied to both the regression problem and the classification problem. While for the regression problem it yields simple exact solutions, this is not the case for the classification problem, because we encounter intractable integrals. In this paper we develop a new derivation that transforms the problem into that of evaluating the ratio of multivariate Gaussian orthant integrals. Moreover, we develop a new Monte Carlo procedure that evaluates these integrals. It is based on some aspects of bootstrap sampling and acceptancerejection. The proposed approach has beneficial properties compared to the existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, such as simplicity, reliability, and speed."}
{"text": "We introduce a new approach to variable selection, called Predictive Correlation Screening, for predictor design. Predictive Correlation Screening (PCS) implements false positive control on the selected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for Familywise Error Rate (FWER), and resultant mean square error of a linear predictor on the selected variables. We apply Predictive Correlation Screening to the following two-stage predictor design problem. An experimenter wants to learn a multivariate predictor of gene expressions based on successive biological samples assayed on mRNA arrays. She assays the whole genome on a few samples and from these assays she selects a small number of variables using Predictive Correlation Screening. To reduce assay cost, she subsequently assays only the selected variables on the remaining samples, to learn the predictor coefficients. We show superiority of Predictive Correlation Screening relative to LASSO and correlation learning (sometimes popularly referred to in the literature as marginal regression or simple thresholding) in terms of performance and computational complexity."}
{"text": "Concept Hierarchies and Formal Concept Analysis are theoretically well grounded and largely experimented methods. They rely on line diagrams called Galois lattices for visualizing and analysing object-attribute sets. Galois lattices are visually seducing and conceptually rich for experts. However they present important drawbacks due to their concept oriented overall structure: analysing what they show is difficult for non experts, navigation is cumbersome, interaction is poor, and scalability is a deep bottleneck for visual interpretation even for experts. In this paper we introduce semantic probes as a means to overcome many of these problems and extend usability and application possibilities of traditional FCA visualization methods. Semantic probes are visual user centred objects which extract and organize reduced Galois sub-hierarchies. They are simpler, clearer, and they provide a better navigation support through a rich set of interaction possibilities. Since probe driven sub-hierarchies are limited to users focus, scalability is under control and interpretation is facilitated. After some successful experiments, several applications are being developed with the remaining problem of finding a compromise between simplicity and conceptual expressivity."}
{"text": "The concept of refinement from probability elicitation is considered for proper scoring rules. Taking directions from the axioms of probability, refinement is further clarified using a Hilbert space interpretation and reformulated into the underlying data distribution setting where connections to maximal marginal diversity and conditional entropy are considered and used to derive measures that provide arbitrarily tight bounds on the Bayes error. Refinement is also reformulated into the classifier output setting and its connections to calibrated classifiers and proper margin losses are established."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a noisy function, given a finite budget n of noisy evaluations to the function. We tackle in this paper the problem of adapting to the function at the same time the number of samples into each stratum and the partition itself. More precisely, it is interesting to refine the partition of the domain in area where the noise to the function, or where the variations of the function, are very heterogeneous. On the other hand, having a (too) refined stratification is not optimal. Indeed, the more refined the stratification, the more difficult it is to adjust the allocation of the samples to the stratification, i.e. sample more points where the noise or variations of the function are larger. We provide in this paper an algorithm that selects online, among a large class of partitions, the partition that provides the optimal trade-off, and allocates the samples almost optimally on this partition."}
{"text": "The fundamental aim of clustering algorithms is to partition data points. We consider tasks where the discovered partition is allowed to vary with some covariate such as space or time. One approach would be to use fragmentation-coagulation processes, but these, being Markov processes, are restricted to linear or tree structured covariate spaces. We define a partition-valued process on an arbitrary covariate space using Gaussian processes. We use the process to construct a multitask clustering model which partitions datapoints in a similar way across multiple data sources, and a time series model of network data which allows cluster assignments to vary over time. We describe sampling algorithms for inference and apply our method to defining cancer subtypes based on different types of cellular characteristics, finding regulatory modules from gene expression data from multiple human populations, and discovering time varying community structure in a social network."}
{"text": "We propose a novel approach for nonlinear regression using a two-layer neural network (NN) model structure with sparsity-favoring hierarchical priors on the network weights. We present an expectation propagation (EP) approach for approximate integration over the posterior distribution of the weights, the hierarchical scale parameters of the priors, and the residual scale. Using a factorized posterior approximation we derive a computationally efficient algorithm, whose complexity scales similarly to an ensemble of independent sparse linear models. The approach enables flexible definition of weight priors with different sparseness properties such as independent Laplace priors with a common scale parameter or Gaussian automatic relevance determination (ARD) priors with different relevance parameters for all inputs. The approach can be extended beyond standard activation functions and NN model structures to form flexible nonlinear predictors from multiple sparse linear models. The effects of the hierarchical priors and the predictive performance of the algorithm are assessed using both simulated and real-world data. Comparisons are made to two alternative models with ARD priors: a Gaussian process with a NN covariance function and marginal maximum a posteriori estimates of the relevance parameters, and a NN with Markov chain Monte Carlo integration over all the unknown model parameters."}
{"text": "We consider learning a causal ordering of variables in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model called LiNGAM. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But, the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions actually are violated. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. The key idea is to detect latent confounders by testing independence between estimated external influences and find subsets (parcels) that include variables that are not affected by latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data and simulated brain imaging data."}
{"text": "Popular sparse estimation methods based on $\\ell_1$-relaxation, such as the Lasso and the Dantzig selector, require the knowledge of the variance of the noise in order to properly tune the regularization parameter. This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks---such as time series, random fields, inverse problems---for which the noise is rarely homoscedastic and its level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure."}
{"text": "We study low rank matrix and tensor completion and propose novel algorithms that employ adaptive sampling schemes to obtain strong performance guarantees. Our algorithms exploit adaptivity to identify entries that are highly informative for learning the column space of the matrix (tensor) and consequently, our results hold even when the row space is highly coherent, in contrast with previous analyses. In the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a $n \\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ from merely $\\Omega(n r^{3/2}\\log(r))$ matrix entries. We also show that one can recover an order $T$ tensor using $\\Omega(n r^{T-1/2}T^2 \\log(r))$ entries. For noisy recovery, our algorithm consistently estimates a low rank matrix corrupted with noise using $\\Omega(n r^{3/2} \\textrm{polylog}(n))$ entries. We complement our study with simulations that verify our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms."}

{"text": "The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for multilook full polarimetric SAR data whose adequacy has been attested in the literature. Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques which depend on this model have been devised, and many of them employ some type of dissimilarity measure. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for four stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these distances, inequalities are obtained which lead to new ways of deriving the Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the discrimination and homogeneity identification capabilities of these distances."}
{"text": "We propose a new method for detecting changes in Markov network structure between two sets of samples. Instead of naively fitting two Markov network models separately to the two data sets and figuring out their difference, we \\emph{directly} learn the network structure change by estimating the ratio of Markov network models. This density-ratio formulation naturally allows us to introduce sparsity in the network structure change, which highly contributes to enhancing interpretability. Furthermore, computation of the normalization term, which is a critical bottleneck of the naive approach, can be remarkably mitigated. We also give the dual formulation of the optimization problem, which further reduces the computation cost for large-scale Markov networks. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method."}
{"text": "We introduce the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a measure of non-linear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimension based on the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\\'enyi Maximum Correlation Coefficient. RDC is defined in terms of correlation of random non-linear copula projections; it is invariant with respect to marginal distribution transformations, has low computational cost and is easy to implement: just five lines of R code, included at the end of the paper."}

{"text": "We consider the following signal recovery problem: given a measurement matrix $\\Phi\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}$ and a noisy observation vector $c\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ constructed from $c = \\Phi\\theta^* + \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d. centered sub-Gaussian distribution, how to recover the signal $\\theta^*$ if $D\\theta^*$ is sparse {\\rca under a linear transformation} $D\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times p}$? One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem: $$\\min_{\\theta} {1\\over 2}\\|\\Phi\\theta - c\\|^2 + \\lambda\\|D\\theta\\|_1.$$ This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix $\\Phi$ is a Gaussian random matrix. Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement number $n\\geq \\Omega(s\\log(p))$ where $s$ is the sparsity number, then the true solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement increases faster than $s\\log(p)$, that is, $s\\log(p)=o(n)$, the estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when $p$ and $s$ go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the special case $D=\\bold{I}_{p\\times p}$ (equivalently LASSO) and improve the existing analysis. The condition number of $D$ plays a critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant, while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with high probability if $m\\over p$ (i.e., $#text{edge}\\over #text{vertex}$) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical simulations are consistent with our theoretical results."}
{"text": "Dasgupta and Shulman showed that a two-round variant of the EM algorithm can learn mixture of Gaussian distributions with near optimal precision with high probability if the Gaussian distributions are well separated and if the dimension is sufficiently high. In this paper, we generalize their theory to learning mixture of high-dimensional Bernoulli templates. Each template is a binary vector, and a template generates examples by randomly switching its binary components independently with a certain probability. In computer vision applications, a binary vector is a feature map of an image, where each binary component indicates whether a local feature or structure is present or absent within a certain cell of the image domain. A Bernoulli template can be considered as a statistical model for images of objects (or parts of objects) from the same category. We show that the two-round EM algorithm can learn mixture of Bernoulli templates with near optimal precision with high probability, if the Bernoulli templates are sufficiently different and if the number of features is sufficiently high. We illustrate the theoretical results by synthetic and real examples."}
{"text": "We propose an original model for inferring team strengths using a Markov Random Field, which can be used to generate historical estimates of the offensive and defensive strengths of a team over time. This model was designed to be applied to sports such as soccer or hockey, in which contest outcomes take value in a limited discrete space. We perform inference using a combination of Expectation Maximization and Loopy Belief Propagation. The challenges of working with a non-convex optimization problem and a high-dimensional parameter space are discussed. The performance of the model is demonstrated on professional soccer data from the English Premier League."}
{"text": "Spatio-temporal point process models play a central role in the analysis of spatially distributed systems in several disciplines. Yet, scalable inference remains computa- tionally challenging both due to the high resolution modelling generally required and the analytically intractable likelihood function. Here, we exploit the sparsity structure typical of (spatially) discretised log-Gaussian Cox process models by using approximate message-passing algorithms. The proposed algorithms scale well with the state dimension and the length of the temporal horizon with moderate loss in distributional accuracy. They hence provide a flexible and faster alternative to both non-linear filtering-smoothing type algorithms and to approaches that implement the Laplace method or expectation propagation on (block) sparse latent Gaussian models. We infer the parameters of the latent Gaussian model using a structured variational Bayes approach. We demonstrate the proposed framework on simulation studies with both Gaussian and point-process observations and use it to reconstruct the conflict intensity and dynamics in Afghanistan from the WikiLeaks Afghan War Diary."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of joint modelling of metabolic signals and gene expression in systems biology applications. We propose an approach based on input-output factorial hidden Markov models and propose a structured variational inference approach to infer the structure and states of the model. We start from the classical free form structured variational mean field approach and use a expectation propagation to approximate the expectations needed in the variational loop. We show that this corresponds to a factored expectation constrained approximate inference. We validate our model through extensive simulations and demonstrate its applicability on a real world bacterial data set."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of vertex classification for graphs constructed from the latent position model. It was shown previously that the approach of embedding the graphs into some Euclidean space followed by classification in that space can yields a universally consistent vertex classifier. However, a major technical difficulty of the approach arises when classifying unlabeled out-of-sample vertices without including them in the embedding stage. In this paper, we studied the out-of-sample extension for the graph embedding step and its impact on the subsequent inference tasks. We show that, under the latent position graph model and for sufficiently large $n$, the mapping of the out-of-sample vertices is close to its true latent position. We then demonstrate that successful inference for the out-of-sample vertices is possible."}
{"text": "We study the adaptive estimation of copula correlation matrix $\\Sigma$ for the semi-parametric elliptical copula model. In this context, the correlations are connected to Kendall's tau through a sine function transformation. Hence, a natural estimate for $\\Sigma$ is the plug-in estimator $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ with Kendall's tau statistic. We first obtain a sharp bound on the operator norm of $\\hat{\\Sigma}-\\Sigma$. Then we study a factor model of $\\Sigma$, for which we propose a refined estimator $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}$ by fitting a low-rank matrix plus a diagonal matrix to $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ using least squares with a nuclear norm penalty on the low-rank matrix. The bound on the operator norm of $\\hat{\\Sigma}-\\Sigma$ serves to scale the penalty term, and we obtain finite sample oracle inequalities for $\\widetilde{\\Sigma}$. We also consider an elementary factor copula model of $\\Sigma$, for which we propose closed-form estimators. All of our estimation procedures are entirely data-driven."}
{"text": "Correlation matrices play a key role in many multivariate methods (e.g., graphical model estimation and factor analysis). The current state-of-the-art in estimating large correlation matrices focuses on the use of Pearson's sample correlation matrix. Although Pearson's sample correlation matrix enjoys various good properties under Gaussian models, it is not an effective estimator when facing heavy-tailed distributions. As a robust alternative, Han and Liu [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 109 (2015) 275-287] advocated the use of a transformed version of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix in estimating high dimensional latent generalized correlation matrix under the transelliptical distribution family (or elliptical copula). The transelliptical family assumes that after unspecified marginal monotone transformations, the data follow an elliptical distribution. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix and its transformed version proposed in Han and Liu [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 109 (2015) 275-287] for estimating the population Kendall's tau correlation matrix and the latent Pearson's correlation matrix under both spectral and restricted spectral norms. With regard to the spectral norm, we highlight the role of \"effective rank\" in quantifying the rate of convergence. With regard to the restricted spectral norm, we for the first time present a \"sign sub-Gaussian condition\" which is sufficient to guarantee that the rank-based correlation matrix estimator attains the fast rate of convergence. In both cases, we do not need any moment condition."}
{"text": "In recent years, manifold learning has become increasingly popular as a tool for performing non-linear dimensionality reduction. This has led to the development of numerous algorithms of varying degrees of complexity that aim to recover man ifold geometry using either local or global features of the data.   Building on the Laplacian Eigenmap and Diffusionmaps framework, we propose a new paradigm that offers a guarantee, under reasonable assumptions, that any manifo ld learning algorithm will preserve the geometry of a data set. Our approach is based on augmenting the output of embedding algorithms with geometric informatio n embodied in the Riemannian metric of the manifold. We provide an algorithm for estimating the Riemannian metric from data and demonstrate possible application s of our approach in a variety of examples."}
{"text": "In systems biomedicine, an experimenter encounters different potential sources of variation in data such as individual samples, multiple experimental conditions, and multi-variable network-level responses. In multiparametric cytometry, which is often used for analyzing patient samples, such issues are critical. While computational methods can identify cell populations in individual samples, without the ability to automatically match them across samples, it is difficult to compare and characterize the populations in typical experiments, such as those responding to various stimulations or distinctive of particular patients or time-points, especially when there are many samples. Joint Clustering and Matching (JCM) is a multi-level framework for simultaneous modeling and registration of populations across a cohort. JCM models every population with a robust multivariate probability distribution. Simultaneously, JCM fits a random-effects model to construct an overall batch template -- used for registering populations across samples, and classifying new samples. By tackling systems-level variation, JCM supports practical biomedical applications involving large cohorts."}
{"text": "We introduce a general constructive setting of the density ratio estimation problem as a solution of a (multidimensional) integral equation. In this equation, not only its right hand side is known approximately, but also the integral operator is defined approximately. We show that this ill-posed problem has a rigorous solution and obtain the solution in a closed form. The key element of this solution is the novel V-matrix, which captures the geometry of the observed samples. We compare our method with three well-known previously proposed ones. Our experimental results demonstrate the good potential of the new approach."}
{"text": "Optimal transportation distances are a fundamental family of parameterized distances for histograms. Despite their appealing theoretical properties, excellent performance in retrieval tasks and intuitive formulation, their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost is prohibitive whenever the histograms' dimension exceeds a few hundreds. We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn-Knopp's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers. We also report improved performance over classical optimal transportation distances on the MNIST benchmark problem."}
{"text": "Causal inference relies on the structure of a graph, often a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Different graphs may result in different causal inference statements and different intervention distributions. To quantify such differences, we propose a (pre-) distance between DAGs, the structural intervention distance (SID). The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements. It is therefore well-suited for evaluating graphs that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs it is also possible to compare CPDAGs, completed partially directed acyclic graphs that represent Markov equivalence classes. Since it differs significantly from the popular Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), the SID constitutes a valuable additional measure. We discuss properties of this distance and provide an efficient implementation with software code available on the first author's homepage (an R package is under construction)."}
{"text": "This paper generalizes beta divergence beyond its classical form associated with power variance functions of Tweedie models. Generalized form is represented by a compact definite integral as a function of variance function of the exponential dispersion model. This compact integral form simplifies derivations of many properties such as scaling, translation and expectation of the beta divergence. Further, we show that beta divergence and (half of) the statistical deviance are equivalent measures."}
{"text": "The strategy of early stopping is a regularization technique based on choosing a stopping time for an iterative algorithm. Focusing on non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we analyze the early stopping strategy for a form of gradient-descent applied to the least-squares loss function. We propose a data-dependent stopping rule that does not involve hold-out or cross-validation data, and we prove upper bounds on the squared error of the resulting function estimate, measured in either the $L^2(P)$ and $L^2(P_n)$ norm. These upper bounds lead to minimax-optimal rates for various kernel classes, including Sobolev smoothness classes and other forms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show through simulation that our stopping rule compares favorably to two other stopping rules, one based on hold-out data and the other based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate. We also establish a tight connection between our early stopping strategy and the solution path of a kernel ridge regression estimator."}
{"text": "The problem of low-rank matrix estimation recently received a lot of attention due to challenging applications. A lot of work has been done on rank-penalized methods and convex relaxation, both on the theoretical and applied sides. However, only a few papers considered Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we review the different type of priors considered on matrices to favour low-rank. We also prove that the obtained Bayesian estimators, under suitable assumptions, enjoys the same optimality properties as the ones based on penalization."}
{"text": "We consider robust covariance estimation with group symmetry constraints. Non-Gaussian covariance estimation, e.g., Tyler scatter estimator and Multivariate Generalized Gaussian distribution methods, usually involve non-convex minimization problems. Recently, it was shown that the underlying principle behind their success is an extended form of convexity over the geodesics in the manifold of positive definite matrices. A modern approach to improve estimation accuracy is to exploit prior knowledge via additional constraints, e.g., restricting the attention to specific classes of covariances which adhere to prior symmetry structures. In this paper, we prove that such group symmetry constraints are also geodesically convex and can therefore be incorporated into various non-Gaussian covariance estimators. Practical examples of such sets include: circulant, persymmetric and complex/quaternion proper structures. We provide a simple numerical technique for finding maximum likelihood estimates under such constraints, and demonstrate their performance advantage using synthetic experiments."}
{"text": "We provide theoretical analysis of the statistical and computational properties of penalized $M$-estimators that can be formulated as the solution to a possibly nonconvex optimization problem. Many important estimators fall in this category, including least squares regression with nonconvex regularization, generalized linear models with nonconvex regularization and sparse elliptical random design regression. For these problems, it is intractable to calculate the global solution due to the nonconvex formulation. In this paper, we propose an approximate regularization path-following method for solving a variety of learning problems with nonconvex objective functions. Under a unified analytic framework, we simultaneously provide explicit statistical and computational rates of convergence for any local solution attained by the algorithm. Computationally, our algorithm attains a global geometric rate of convergence for calculating the full regularization path, which is optimal among all first-order algorithms. Unlike most existing methods that only attain geometric rates of convergence for one single regularization parameter, our algorithm calculates the full regularization path with the same iteration complexity. In particular, we provide a refined iteration complexity bound to sharply characterize the performance of each stage along the regularization path. Statistically, we provide sharp sample complexity analysis for all the approximate local solutions along the regularization path. In particular, our analysis improves upon existing results by providing a more refined sample complexity bound as well as an exact support recovery result for the final estimator. These results show that the final estimator attains an oracle statistical property due to the usage of nonconvex penalty."}
{"text": "Adaptive filtering algorithms operating in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have demonstrated superiority over their linear counterpart for nonlinear system identification. Unfortunately, an undesirable characteristic of these methods is that the order of the filters grows linearly with the number of input data. This dramatically increases the computational burden and memory requirement. A variety of strategies based on dictionary learning have been proposed to overcome this severe drawback. Few, if any, of these works analyze the problem of updating the dictionary in a time-varying environment. In this paper, we present an analytical study of the convergence behavior of the Gaussian least-mean-square algorithm in the case where the statistics of the dictionary elements only partially match the statistics of the input data. This allows us to emphasize the need for updating the dictionary in an online way, by discarding the obsolete elements and adding appropriate ones. We introduce a kernel least-mean-square algorithm with L1-norm regularization to automatically perform this task. The stability in the mean of this method is analyzed, and its performance is tested with experiments."}

{"text": "We study sparse principal component analysis for high dimensional vector autoregressive time series under a doubly asymptotic framework, which allows the dimension $d$ to scale with the series length $T$. We treat the transition matrix of time series as a nuisance parameter and directly apply sparse principal component analysis on multivariate time series as if the data are independent. We provide explicit non-asymptotic rates of convergence for leading eigenvector estimation and extend this result to principal subspace estimation. Our analysis illustrates that the spectral norm of the transition matrix plays an essential role in determining the final rates. We also characterize sufficient conditions under which sparse principal component analysis attains the optimal parametric rate. Our theoretical results are backed up by thorough numerical studies."}
{"text": "The vector autoregressive (VAR) model is a powerful tool in modeling complex time series and has been exploited in many fields. However, fitting high dimensional VAR model poses some unique challenges: On one hand, the dimensionality, caused by modeling a large number of time series and higher order autoregressive processes, is usually much higher than the time series length; On the other hand, the temporal dependence structure in the VAR model gives rise to extra theoretical challenges. In high dimensions, one popular approach is to assume the transition matrix is sparse and fit the VAR model using the \"least squares\" method with a lasso-type penalty. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative way in estimating the VAR model. The main idea is, via exploiting the temporal dependence structure, to formulate the estimating problem into a linear program. There is instant advantage for the proposed approach over the lasso-type estimators: The estimation equation can be decomposed into multiple sub-equations and accordingly can be efficiently solved in a parallel fashion. In addition, our method brings new theoretical insights into the VAR model analysis. So far the theoretical results developed in high dimensions (e.g., Song and Bickel (2011) and Kock and Callot (2012)) mainly pose assumptions on the design matrix of the formulated regression problems. Such conditions are indirect about the transition matrices and not transparent. In contrast, our results show that the operator norm of the transition matrices plays an important role in estimation accuracy. We provide explicit rates of convergence for both estimation and prediction. In addition, we provide thorough experiments on both synthetic and real-world equity data to show that there are empirical advantages of our method over the lasso-type estimators in both parameter estimation and forecasting."}
{"text": "The Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM) is a non-linear probabilistic method of embedding a high dimensional dataset in terms low dimensional `latent' variables. In this paper we illustrate that maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the latent variables and hyperparameters can be used for model selection and hence we can determine the optimal number or latent variables and the most appropriate model. This is an alternative to the variational approaches developed recently and may be useful when we want to use a non-Gaussian prior or kernel functions that don't have automatic relevance determination (ARD) parameters. Using a second order expansion of the latent variable posterior we can marginalise the latent variables and obtain an estimate for the hyperparameter posterior. Secondly, we use the GP-LVM to integrate multiple data sources by simultaneously embedding them in terms of common latent variables. We present results from synthetic data to illustrate the successful detection and retrieval of low dimensional structure from high dimensional data. We demonstrate that the integration of multiple data sources leads to more robust performance. Finally, we show that when the data are used for binary classification tasks we can attain a significant gain in prediction accuracy when the low dimensional representation is used."}
{"text": "The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central problem in the analysis of financial time series. A common approach is to express these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function is assumed to be constant but this may be inaccurate when there are covariates that could have a large influence on the dependence structure of the data. To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other time-varying copula methods."}
{"text": "The interaction between transitivity and sparsity, two common features in empirical networks, implies that there are local regions of large sparse networks that are dense. We call this the blessing of transitivity and it has consequences for both modeling and inference. Extant research suggests that statistical inference for the Stochastic Blockmodel is more difficult when the edges are sparse. However, this conclusion is confounded by the fact that the asymptotic limit in all of the previous studies is not merely sparse, but also non-transitive. To retain transitivity, the blocks cannot grow faster than the expected degree. Thus, in sparse models, the blocks must remain asymptotically small. \\n Previous algorithmic research demonstrates that small \"local\" clusters are more amenable to computation, visualization, and interpretation when compared to \"global\" graph partitions. This paper provides the first statistical results that demonstrate how these small transitive clusters are also more amenable to statistical estimation. Theorem 2 shows that a \"local\" clustering algorithm can, with high probability, detect a transitive stochastic block of a fixed size (e.g. 30 nodes) embedded in a large graph. The only constraint on the ambient graph is that it is large and sparse--it could be generated at random or by an adversary--suggesting a theoretical explanation for the robust empirical performance of local clustering algorithms."}
{"text": "Community detection in graphs has been the subject of many algorithms. Recent methods want to optimize a modularity function which shows a maximum of relationships within communities and found a minimum of inter-community relations. these algorithms are applied to unipartite, multipartite and directed graphs. However, given the NP-completeness of the problem, these algorithms are heuristics that do not guarantee an optimum. In this paper we introduce an algorithm which, based on an approximate solution obtained through a efficient detection algorithm, modifie it to achieve a local optimum based on a function. this reassignment function is a potential function and therefore the computed optimum is a Nash equilibrium. We supplement our method with an overlap function that allows to have simultaneously the two detection modes. Several experiments show the interest of our approach."}
{"text": "Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (and thus Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a finite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose and study a family of sparsity-inducing penalty functions. Since the penalty functions are related to the kinetic energy in special relativity, we call them \\emph{kinetic energy plus} (KEP) functions. We construct the KEP function by using the concave conjugate of a $\\chi^2$-distance function and present several novel insights into the KEP function with $q=1$. In particular, we derive a thresholding operator based on the KEP function, and prove its mathematical properties and asymptotic properties in sparsity modeling. Moreover, we show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for the KEP function. Additionally, we discuss the relationship of KEP with the penalty functions $\\ell_{1/2}$ and MCP. The theoretical and empirical analysis validates that the KEP function is effective and efficient in high-dimensional data modeling."}
{"text": "In this project we further investigate the idea of reducing the dimensionality of datasets using a Borel isomorphism with the purpose of subsequently applying supervised learning algorithms, as originally suggested by my supervisor V. Pestov (in 2011 Dagstuhl preprint). Any consistent learning algorithm, for example kNN, retains universal consistency after a Borel isomorphism is applied. A series of concrete examples of Borel isomorphisms that reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset is provided, based on multiplying the data by orthogonal matrices before the dimensionality reducing Borel isomorphism is applied. We test the accuracy of the resulting classifier in a lower dimensional space with various data sets. Working with a phoneme voice recognition dataset, of dimension 256 with 5 classes (phonemes), we show that a Borel isomorphic reduction to dimension 16 leads to a minimal drop in accuracy. In conclusion, we discuss further prospects of the method."}
{"text": "We introduce an application of the group lasso to design of experiments. Note that we are NOT trying to explain experimental design for the group lasso. Conversely, we explain how we can use the idea of the group lasso in experimental design, showing that the problem of constructing an optimal design matrix can be transformed into a problem of the group lasso. In some numerical examples, we show that we can obtain the orthogonal arrays as the solutions of the group lasso problems."}
{"text": "Big Data bring new opportunities to modern society and challenges to data scientists. On one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity, and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This article give overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasis on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogeneous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data can not be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions."}
{"text": "Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as Gaussian mixture models, are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. These models consist of observable and latent variables, which represent the observable data and the underlying data-generation process, respectively. Unsupervised learning tasks, such as cluster analysis, are regarded as estimations of latent variables based on the observable ones. The estimation of latent variables in semi-supervised learning, where some labels are observed, will be more precise than that in unsupervised, and one of the concerns is to clarify the effect of the labeled data. However, there has not been sufficient theoretical analysis of the accuracy of the estimation of latent variables. In a previous study, a distribution-based error function was formulated, and its asymptotic form was calculated for unsupervised learning with generative models. It has been shown that, for the estimation of latent variables, the Bayes method is more accurate than the maximum-likelihood method. The present paper reveals the asymptotic forms of the error function in Bayesian semi-supervised learning for both discriminative and generative models. The results show that the generative model, which uses all of the given data, performs better when the model is well specified."}
{"text": "We propose a general framework for reduced-rank modeling of matrix-valued data. By applying a generalized nuclear norm penalty we can directly model low-dimensional latent variables associated with rows and columns. Our framework flexibly incorporates row and column features, smoothing kernels, and other sources of side information by penalizing deviations from the row and column models. Moreover, a large class of these models can be estimated scalably using convex optimization. The computational bottleneck in each case is one singular value decomposition per iteration of a large but easy-to-apply matrix. Our framework generalizes traditional convex matrix completion and multi-task learning methods as well as maximum a posteriori estimation under a large class of popular hierarchical Bayesian models."}
{"text": "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been one of the most popular methods for frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Despite its efficiency, a potential problem is that using pre-constructed sine-cosine waves as the required reference signals in the CCA method often does not result in the optimal recognition accuracy due to their lack of features from the real EEG data. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel method based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (MsetCCA) to optimize the reference signals used in the CCA method for SSVEP frequency recognition. The MsetCCA method learns multiple linear transforms that implement joint spatial filtering to maximize the overall correlation among canonical variates, and hence extracts SSVEP common features from multiple sets of EEG data recorded at the same stimulus frequency. The optimized reference signals are formed by combination of the common features and completely based on training data. Experimental study with EEG data from ten healthy subjects demonstrates that the MsetCCA method improves the recognition accuracy of SSVEP frequency in comparison with the CCA method and other two competing methods (multiway CCA (MwayCCA) and phase constrained CCA (PCCA)), especially for a small number of channels and a short time window length. The superiority indicates that the proposed MsetCCA method is a new promising candidate for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCIs."}
{"text": "Reshef & Reshef recently published a paper in which they present a method called the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) that can detect all forms of statistical dependence between pairs of variables as sample size goes to infinity. While this method has been praised by some, it has also been criticized for its lack of power in finite samples. We seek to modify MIC so that it has higher power in detecting associations for limited sample sizes. Here we present the Generalized Mean Information Coefficient (GMIC), a generalization of MIC which incorporates a tuning parameter that can be used to modify the complexity of the association favored by the measure. We define GMIC and prove it maintains several key asymptotic properties of MIC. Its increased power over MIC is demonstrated using a simulation of eight different functional relationships at sixty different noise levels. The results are compared to the Pearson correlation, distance correlation, and MIC. Simulation results suggest that while generally GMIC has slightly lower power than the distance correlation measure, it achieves higher power than MIC for many forms of underlying association. For some functional relationships, GMIC surpasses all other statistics calculated. Preliminary results suggest choosing a moderate value of the tuning parameter for GMIC will yield a test that is robust across underlying relationships. GMIC is a promising new method that mitigates the power issues suffered by MIC, at the possible expense of equitability. Nonetheless, distance correlation was in our simulations more powerful for many forms of underlying relationships. At a minimum, this work motivates further consideration of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) methods as statistical tests of independence."}
{"text": "We describe ways to define and calculate $L_1$-norm signal subspaces which are less sensitive to outlying data than $L_2$-calculated subspaces. We focus on the computation of the $L_1$ maximum-projection principal component of a data matrix containing N signal samples of dimension D and conclude that the general problem is formally NP-hard in asymptotically large N, D. We prove, however, that the case of engineering interest of fixed dimension D and asymptotically large sample support N is not and we present an optimal algorithm of complexity $O(N^D)$. We generalize to multiple $L_1$-max-projection components and present an explicit optimal $L_1$ subspace calculation algorithm in the form of matrix nuclear-norm evaluations. We conclude with illustrations of $L_1$-subspace signal processing in the fields of data dimensionality reduction and direction-of-arrival estimation."}
{"text": "This paper considers the problem of subspace clustering under noise. Specifically, we study the behavior of Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) when either adversarial or random noise is added to the unlabelled input data points, which are assumed to be in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. We show that a modified version of SSC is \\emph{provably effective} in correctly identifying the underlying subspaces, even with noisy data. This extends theoretical guarantee of this algorithm to more practical settings and provides justification to the success of SSC in a class of real applications."}
{"text": "Spectral clustering is sensitive to how graphs are constructed from data particularly when proximal and imbalanced clusters are present. We show that Ratio-Cut (RCut) or normalized cut (NCut) objectives are not tailored to imbalanced data since they tend to emphasize cut sizes over cut values. We propose a graph partitioning problem that seeks minimum cut partitions under minimum size constraints on partitions to deal with imbalanced data. Our approach parameterizes a family of graphs, by adaptively modulating node degrees on a fixed node set, to yield a set of parameter dependent cuts reflecting varying levels of imbalance. The solution to our problem is then obtained by optimizing over these parameters. We present rigorous limit cut analysis results to justify our approach. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "Regularized variants of Principal Components Analysis, especially Sparse PCA and Functional PCA, are among the most useful tools for the analysis of complex high-dimensional data. Many examples of massive data, have both sparse and functional (smooth) aspects and may benefit from a regularization scheme that can capture both forms of structure. For example, in neuro-imaging data, the brain's response to a stimulus may be restricted to a discrete region of activation (spatial sparsity), while exhibiting a smooth response within that region. We propose a unified approach to regularized PCA which can induce both sparsity and smoothness in both the row and column principal components. Our framework generalizes much of the previous literature, with sparse, functional, two-way sparse, and two-way functional PCA all being special cases of our approach. Our method permits flexible combinations of sparsity and smoothness that lead to improvements in feature selection and signal recovery, as well as more interpretable PCA factors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on simulated data and a neuroimaging example on EEG data."}
{"text": "We informally call a stochastic process learnable if it admits a generalization error approaching zero in probability for any concept class with finite VC-dimension (IID processes are the simplest example). A mixture of learnable processes need not be learnable itself, and certainly its generalization error need not decay at the same rate. In this paper, we argue that it is natural in predictive PAC to condition not on the past observations but on the mixture component of the sample path. This definition not only matches what a realistic learner might demand, but also allows us to sidestep several otherwise grave problems in learning from dependent data. In particular, we give a novel PAC generalization bound for mixtures of learnable processes with a generalization error that is not worse than that of each mixture component. We also provide a characterization of mixtures of absolutely regular ($\\beta$-mixing) processes, of independent probability-theoretic interest."}
{"text": "We present a numerical algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problems under noisy separability. An NMF problem under separability can be stated as one of finding all vertices of the convex hull of data points. The research interest of this paper is to find the vectors as close to the vertices as possible in a situation in which noise is added to the data points. Our algorithm is designed to capture the shape of the convex hull of data points by using its enclosing ellipsoid. We show that the algorithm has correctness and robustness properties from theoretical and practical perspectives; correctness here means that if the data points do not contain any noise, the algorithm can find the vertices of their convex hull; robustness means that if the data points contain noise, the algorithm can find the near-vertices. Finally, we apply the algorithm to document clustering, and report the experimental results."}
{"text": "Theory of graphical models has matured over more than three decades to provide the backbone for several classes of models that are used in a myriad of applications such as genetic mapping of diseases, credit risk evaluation, reliability and computer security, etc. Despite of their generic applicability and wide adoptance, the constraints imposed by undirected graphical models and Bayesian networks have also been recognized to be unnecessarily stringent under certain circumstances. This observation has led to the proposal of several generalizations that aim at more relaxed constraints by which the models can impose local or context-specific dependence structures. Here we consider an additional class of such models, termed as stratified graphical models. We develop a method for Bayesian learning of these models by deriving an analytical expression for the marginal likelihood of data under a specific subclass of decomposable stratified models. A non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is further used to identify models that are highly supported by the posterior distribution over the model space. Our method is illustrated and compared with ordinary graphical models through application to several real and synthetic datasets."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of learning causal directed acyclic graphs from an observational joint distribution. One can use these graphs to predict the outcome of interventional experiments, from which data are often not available. We show that if the observational distribution follows a structural equation model with an additive noise structure, the directed acyclic graph becomes identifiable from the distribution under mild conditions. This constitutes an interesting alternative to traditional methods that assume faithfulness and identify only the Markov equivalence class of the graph, thus leaving some edges undirected. We provide practical algorithms for finitely many samples, RESIT (Regression with Subsequent Independence Test) and two methods based on an independence score. We prove that RESIT is correct in the population setting and provide an empirical evaluation."}

MPBART is flexible to allow inclusion of predictors that describe the observed units as well as the available choice alternatives. Through two simulation studies and four real data examples, we show that MPBART exhibits very good predictive performance in comparison to other discrete choice and multiclass classification methods. To implement MPBART, we have developed an R package mpbart available freely from CRAN repositories."}
{"text": "In standard clustering problems, data points are represented by vectors, and by stacking them together, one forms a data matrix with row or column cluster structure. In this paper, we consider a class of binary matrices, arising in many applications, which exhibit both row and column cluster structure, and our goal is to exactly recover the underlying row and column clusters by observing only a small fraction of noisy entries. We first derive a lower bound on the minimum number of observations needed for exact cluster recovery. Then, we propose three algorithms with different running time and compare the number of observations needed by them for successful cluster recovery. Our analytical results show smooth time-data trade-offs: one can gradually reduce the computational complexity when increasingly more observations are available."}

{"text": "The most important aspect of any classifier is its error rate, because this quantifies its predictive capacity. Thus, the accuracy of error estimation is critical. Error estimation is problematic in small-sample classifier design because the error must be estimated using the same data from which the classifier has been designed. Use of prior knowledge, in the form of a prior distribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions to which the true, but unknown, feature-distribution belongs, can facilitate accurate error estimation (in the mean-square sense) in circumstances where accurate completely model-free error estimation is impossible. This paper provides analytic asymptotically exact finite-sample approximations for various performance metrics of the resulting Bayesian Minimum Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) error estimator in the case of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the multivariate Gaussian model. These performance metrics include the first, second, and cross moments of the Bayesian MMSE error estimator with the true error of LDA, and therefore, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of the estimator. We lay down the theoretical groundwork for Kolmogorov double-asymptotics in a Bayesian setting, which enables us to derive asymptotic expressions of the desired performance metrics. From these we produce analytic finite-sample approximations and demonstrate their accuracy via numerical examples. Various examples illustrate the behavior of these approximations and their use in determining the necessary sample size to achieve a desired RMS. The Supplementary Material contains derivations for some equations and added figures."}

{"text": "Significant success has been reported recently using deep neural networks for classification. Such large networks can be computationally intensive, even after training is over. Implementing these trained networks in hardware chips with a limited precision of synaptic weights may improve their speed and energy efficiency by several orders of magnitude, thus enabling their integration into small and low-power electronic devices. With this motivation, we develop a computationally efficient learning algorithm for multilayer neural networks with binary weights, assuming all the hidden neurons have a fan-out of one. This algorithm, derived within a Bayesian probabilistic online setting, is shown to work well for both synthetic and real-world problems, performing comparably to algorithms with real-valued weights, while retaining computational tractability."}
{"text": "A novel linear classification method that possesses the merits of both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Distance-weighted Discrimination (DWD) is proposed in this article. The proposed Distance-weighted Support Vector Machine method can be viewed as a hybrid of SVM and DWD that finds the classification direction by minimizing mainly the DWD loss, and determines the intercept term in the SVM manner. We show that our method inheres the merit of DWD, and hence, overcomes the data-piling and overfitting issue of SVM. On the other hand, the new method is not subject to imbalanced data issue which was a main advantage of SVM over DWD. It uses an unusual loss which combines the Hinge loss (of SVM) and the DWD loss through a trick of axillary hyperplane. Several theoretical properties, including Fisher consistency and asymptotic normality of the DWSVM solution are developed. We use some simulated examples to show that the new method can compete DWD and SVM on both classification performance and interpretability. A real data application further establishes the usefulness of our approach."}
{"text": "Classification is an important topic in statistics and machine learning with great potential in many real applications. In this paper, we investigate two popular large margin classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), under two contexts: the high-dimensional, low-sample size data and the imbalanced data. A unified family of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to identify the similarities and differences between SVM and DWD. It is well known that many classifiers overfit the data in the high-dimensional setting; and others are sensitive to the imbalanced data, that is, the class with a larger sample size overly influences the classifier and pushes the decision boundary towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to the imbalanced data issue, but it overfits high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling phenomena. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the high-dimensional setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to the imbalanced ratio of sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection between SVM and DWD, and improves both methods by providing a better trade-off between sensitivity to the imbalanced data and overfitting the high-dimensional data. Several asymptotic properties of the FLAME classifiers are studied. Simulations and real data applications are investigated to illustrate the usefulness of the FLAME classifiers."}
{"text": "We present a robust alternative to principal component analysis (PCA) --- called elliptical component analysis (ECA) --- for analyzing high dimensional, elliptically distributed data. ECA estimates the eigenspace of the covariance matrix of the elliptical data. To cope with heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, a multivariate rank statistic is exploited. At the model-level, we consider two settings: either that the leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are non-sparse or that they are sparse. Methodologically, we propose ECA procedures for both non-sparse and sparse settings. Theoretically, we provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic analyses quantifying the theoretical performances of ECA. In the non-sparse setting, we show that ECA's performance is highly related to the effective rank of the covariance matrix. In the sparse setting, the results are twofold: (i) We show that the sparse ECA estimator based on a combinatoric program attains the optimal rate of convergence; (ii) Based on some recent developments in estimating sparse leading eigenvectors, we show that a computationally efficient sparse ECA estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence under a suboptimal scaling."}
{"text": "Mixed linear regression involves the recovery of two (or more) unknown vectors from unlabeled linear measurements; that is, where each sample comes from exactly one of the vectors, but we do not know which one. It is a classic problem, and the natural and empirically most popular approach to its solution has been the EM algorithm. As in other settings, this is prone to bad local minima; however, each iteration is very fast (alternating between guessing labels, and solving with those labels).   In this paper we provide a new initialization procedure for EM, based on finding the leading two eigenvectors of an appropriate matrix. We then show that with this, a re-sampled version of the EM algorithm provably converges to the correct vectors, under natural assumptions on the sampling distribution, and with nearly optimal (unimprovable) sample complexity. This provides not only the first characterization of EM's performance, but also much lower sample complexity as compared to both standard (randomly initialized) EM, and other methods for this problem."}
{"text": "We present new algorithms to compute the mean of a set of empirical probability measures under the optimal transport metric. This mean, known as the Wasserstein barycenter, is the measure that minimizes the sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We propose two original algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters that build upon the subgradient method. A direct implementation of these algorithms is, however, too costly because it would require the repeated resolution of large primal and dual optimal transport problems to compute subgradients. Extending the work of Cuturi (2013), we propose to smooth the Wasserstein distance used in the definition of Wasserstein barycenters with an entropic regularizer and recover in doing so a strictly convex objective whose gradients can be computed for a considerably cheaper computational cost using matrix scaling algorithms. We use these algorithms to visualize a large family of images and to solve a constrained clustering problem."}
{"text": "Substantial evidence indicates that major psychiatric disorders are associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to strong interest in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder status. In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the GraphNet regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or GraphNet regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and GraphNet regularized SVM with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D \"connectome space,\" offering an additional layer of interpretability that could provide new insights about various disease processes."}

{"text": "Kernel methods have been widely applied to machine learning and other questions of approximating an unknown function from its finite sample data. To ensure arbitrary accuracy of such approximation, various denseness conditions are imposed on the selected kernel. This note contributes to the study of universal, characteristic, and $C_0$-universal kernels. We first give simple and direct description of the difference and relation among these three kinds of universalities of kernels. We then focus on translation-invariant and weighted polynomial kernels. A simple and shorter proof of the known characterization of characteristic translation-invariant kernels will be presented. The main purpose of the note is to give a delicate discussion on the universalities of weighted polynomial kernels."}
{"text": "We consider discrete graphical models Markov with respect to a graph $G$ and propose two distributed marginal methods to estimate the maximum likelihood estimate of the canonical parameter of the model. Both methods are based on a relaxation of the marginal likelihood obtained by considering the density of the variables represented by a vertex $v$ of $G$ and a neighborhood. The two methods differ by the size of the neighborhood of $v$. We show that the estimates are consistent and that those obtained with the larger neighborhood have smaller asymptotic variance than the ones obtained through the smaller neighborhood."}
{"text": "We introduce a computationally effective algorithm for a linear model selection consisting of three steps: screening--ordering--selection (SOS). Screening of predictors is based on the thresholded Lasso that is l_1 penalized least squares. The screened predictors are then fitted using least squares (LS) and ordered with respect to their t statistics. Finally, a model is selected using greedy generalized information criterion (GIC) that is l_0 penalized LS in a nested family induced by the ordering. We give non-asymptotic upper bounds on error probability of each step of the SOS algorithm in terms of both penalties. Then we obtain selection consistency for different (n, p) scenarios under conditions which are needed for screening consistency of the Lasso. For the traditional setting (n >p) we give Sanov-type bounds on the error probabilities of the ordering--selection algorithm. Its surprising consequence is that the selection error of greedy GIC is asymptotically not larger than of exhaustive GIC. We also obtain new bounds on prediction and estimation errors for the Lasso which are proved in parallel for the algorithm used in practice and its formal version."}
{"text": "Combining information from different sources is a common way to improve classification accuracy in Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI). For instance, in small sample settings it is useful to integrate data from other subjects or sessions in order to improve the estimation quality of the spatial filters or the classifier. Since data from different subjects may show large variability, it is crucial to weight the contributions according to importance. Many multi-subject learning algorithms determine the optimal weighting in a separate step by using heuristics, however, without ensuring that the selected weights are optimal with respect to classification. In this work we apply Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to this problem. MKL has been widely used for feature fusion in computer vision and allows to simultaneously learn the classifier and the optimal weighting. We compare the MKL method to two baseline approaches and investigate the reasons for performance improvement."}
{"text": "Latent force models (LFM) are principled approaches to incorporating solutions to differential equations within non-parametric inference methods. Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model."}
{"text": "We consider learning the possible causal direction of two observed variables in the presence of latent confounding variables. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate causal direction assuming linear or some type of nonlinear relationship and no latent confounders. However, the estimation results could be distorted if either assumption is actually violated. In this paper, we first propose a new linear non-Gaussian acyclic structural equation model with individual-specific effects that allows latent confounders to be considered. We then propose an empirical Bayesian approach for estimating possible causal direction using the new model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial and real-world data."}
{"text": "We explore the performance of several automatic bandwidth selectors, originally designed for density gradient estimation, as data-based procedures for nonparametric, modal clustering. The key tool to obtain a clustering from density gradient estimators is the mean shift algorithm, which allows to obtain a partition not only of the data sample, but also of the whole space. The results of our simulation study suggest that most of the methods considered here, like cross validation and plug in bandwidth selectors, are useful for cluster analysis via the mean shift algorithm."}
{"text": "Incorporating spatial information into hyperspectral unmixing procedures has been shown to have positive effects, due to the inherent spatial-spectral duality in hyperspectral scenes. Current research works that consider spatial information are mainly focused on the linear mixing model. In this paper, we investigate a variational approach to incorporating spatial correlation into a nonlinear unmixing procedure. A nonlinear algorithm operating in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, associated with an $\\ell_1$ local variation norm as the spatial regularizer, is derived. Experimental results, with both synthetic and real data, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."}
{"text": "The kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm is an appealing tool for online identification of nonlinear systems due to its simplicity and robustness. In addition to choosing a reproducing kernel and setting filter parameters, designing a KLMS adaptive filter requires to select a so-called dictionary in order to get a finite-order model. This dictionary has a significant impact on performance, and requires careful consideration. Theoretical analysis of KLMS as a function of dictionary setting has rarely, if ever, been addressed in the literature. In an analysis previously published by the authors, the dictionary elements were assumed to be governed by the same probability density function of the input data. In this paper, we modify this study by considering the dictionary as part of the filter parameters to be set. This theoretical analysis paves the way for future investigations on KLMS dictionary design."}
{"text": "In this manuscript we consider the problem of jointly estimating multiple graphical models in high dimensions. We assume that the data are collected from n subjects, each of which consists of T possibly dependent observations. The graphical models of subjects vary, but are assumed to change smoothly corresponding to a measure of closeness between subjects. We propose a kernel based method for jointly estimating all graphical models. Theoretically, under a double asymptotic framework, where both (T,n) and the dimension d can increase, we provide the explicit rate of convergence in parameter estimation. It characterizes the strength one can borrow across different individuals and impact of data dependence on parameter estimation. Empirically, experiments on both synthetic and real resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "We propose a family of multivariate Gaussian process models for correlated outputs, based on assuming that the likelihood function takes the generic form of the multivariate exponential family distribution (EFD). We denote this model as a multivariate generalized Gaussian process model, and derive Taylor and Laplace algorithms for approximate inference on the generic model. By instantiating the EFD with specific parameter functions, we obtain two novel GP models (and corresponding inference algorithms) for correlated outputs: 1) a Von-Mises GP for angle regression; and 2) a Dirichlet GP for regressing on the multinomial simplex."}
{"text": "We propose a new stochastic dual coordinate ascent technique that can be applied to a wide range of regularized learning problems. Our method is based on Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) to deal with complex regularization functions such as structured regularizations. Although the original ADMM is a batch method, the proposed method offers a stochastic update rule where each iteration requires only one or few sample observations. Moreover, our method can naturally afford mini-batch update and it gives speed up of convergence. We show that, under mild assumptions, our method converges exponentially. The numerical experiments show that our method actually performs efficiently."}
{"text": "Analyzing and understanding the structure of complex relational data is important in many applications including analysis of the connectivity in the human brain. Such networks can have prominent patterns on different scales, calling for a hierarchically structured model. We propose two non-parametric Bayesian hierarchical network models based on Gibbs fragmentation tree priors, and demonstrate their ability to capture nested patterns in simulated networks. On real networks we demonstrate detection of hierarchical structure and show predictive performance on par with the state of the art. We envision that our methods can be employed in exploratory analysis of large scale complex networks for example to model human brain connectivity."}
{"text": "Most Machine Learning (ML) methods, from clustering to classification, rely on a distance function to describe relationships between datapoints. For complex datasets it is hard to avoid making some arbitrary choices when defining a distance function. To compare images, one must choose a spatial scale, for signals, a temporal scale. The right scale is hard to pin down and it is preferable when results do not depend too tightly on the exact value one picked. Topological data analysis seeks to address this issue by focusing on the notion of neighbourhood instead of distance. It is shown that in some cases a simpler solution is available. It can be checked how strongly distance relationships depend on a hyperparameter using dimensionality reduction. A variant of dynamical multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) is formulated, which embeds datapoints as curves. The resulting algorithm is based on the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) and provides a simple and efficient way of visualizing changes and invariances in distance patterns as a hyperparameter is varied. A variant to analyze the dependence on multiple hyperparameters is also presented. A cMDS algorithm that is straightforward to implement, use and extend is provided. To illustrate the possibilities of cMDS, cMDS is applied to several real-world data sets."}
{"text": "In Stochastic blockmodels, which are among the most prominent statistical models for cluster analysis of complex networks, clusters are defined as groups of nodes with statistically similar link probabilities within and between groups. A recent extension by Karrer and Newman incorporates a node degree correction to model degree heterogeneity within each group. Although this demonstrably leads to better performance on several networks it is not obvious whether modelling node degree is always appropriate or necessary. We formulate the degree corrected stochastic blockmodel as a non-parametric Bayesian model, incorporating a parameter to control the amount of degree correction which can then be inferred from data. Additionally, our formulation yields principled ways of inferring the number of groups as well as predicting missing links in the network which can be used to quantify the model's predictive performance. On synthetic data we demonstrate that including the degree correction yields better performance both on recovering the true group structure and predicting missing links when degree heterogeneity is present, whereas performance is on par for data with no degree heterogeneity within clusters. On seven real networks (with no ground truth group structure available) we show that predictive performance is about equal whether or not degree correction is included; however, for some networks significantly fewer clusters are discovered when correcting for degree indicating that the data can be more compactly explained by clusters of heterogenous degree nodes."}
{"text": "We propose a method for inferring the conditional indepen- dence graph (CIG) of a high-dimensional discrete-time Gaus- sian vector random process from finite-length observations. Our approach does not rely on a parametric model (such as, e.g., an autoregressive model) for the vector random process; rather, it only assumes certain spectral smoothness proper- ties. The proposed inference scheme is compressive in that it works for sample sizes that are (much) smaller than the number of scalar process components. We provide analytical conditions for our method to correctly identify the CIG with high probability."}
{"text": "In this work we compute lower Lipschitz bounds of $\\ell_p$ pooling operators for $p=1, 2, \\infty$ as well as $\\ell_p$ pooling operators preceded by half-rectification layers. These give sufficient conditions for the design of invertible neural network layers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and image patches confirm that pooling layers can be inverted with phase recovery algorithms. Moreover, the regularity of the inverse pooling, controlled by the lower Lipschitz constant, is empirically verified with a nearest neighbor regression."}
{"text": "Symmetric binary matrices representing relations among entities are commonly collected in many areas. Our focus is on dynamically evolving binary relational matrices, with interest being in inference on the relationship structure and prediction. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian dynamic model, which reduces dimensionality in characterizing the binary matrix through a lower-dimensional latent space representation, with the latent coordinates evolving in continuous time via Gaussian processes. By using a logistic mapping function from the probability matrix space to the latent relational space, we obtain a flexible and computational tractable formulation. Employing P\\`olya-Gamma data augmentation, an efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation, with the dimension of the latent space automatically inferred. We provide some theoretical results on flexibility of the model, and illustrate performance via simulation experiments. We also consider an application to co-movements in world financial markets."}
{"text": "We investigate a generic problem of learning pairwise exponential family graphical models with pairwise sufficient statistics defined by a global mapping function, e.g., Mercer kernels. This subclass of pairwise graphical models allow us to flexibly capture complex interactions among variables beyond pairwise product. We propose two $\\ell_1$-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimators to learn the model parameters from i.i.d. samples. The first one is a joint estimator which estimates all the parameters simultaneously. The second one is a node-wise conditional estimator which estimates the parameters individually for each node. For both estimators, we show that under proper conditions the extra flexibility gained in our model comes at almost no cost of statistical and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real datasets."}
{"text": "For random graphs distributed according to stochastic blockmodels, a special case of latent position graphs, adjacency spectral embedding followed by appropriate vertex classification is asymptotically Bayes optimal; but this approach requires knowledge of and critically depends on the model dimension. In this paper, we propose a sparse representation vertex classifier which does not require information about the model dimension. This classifier represents a test vertex as a sparse combination of the vertices in the training set and uses the recovered coefficients to classify the test vertex. We prove consistency of our proposed classifier for stochastic blockmodels, and demonstrate that the sparse representation classifier can predict vertex labels with higher accuracy than adjacency spectral embedding approaches via both simulation studies and real data experiments. Our results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed vertex classifier when the model dimension is unknown."}
{"text": "Robust tensor recovery plays an instrumental role in robustifying tensor decompositions for multilinear data analysis against outliers, gross corruptions and missing values and has a diverse array of applications. In this paper, we study the problem of robust low-rank tensor recovery in a convex optimization framework, drawing upon recent advances in robust Principal Component Analysis and tensor completion. We propose tailored optimization algorithms with global convergence guarantees for solving both the constrained and the Lagrangian formulations of the problem. These algorithms are based on the highly efficient alternating direction augmented Lagrangian and accelerated proximal gradient methods. We also propose a nonconvex model that can often improve the recovery results from the convex models. We investigate the empirical recoverability properties of the convex and nonconvex formulations and compare the computational performance of the algorithms on simulated data. We demonstrate through a number of real applications the practical effectiveness of this convex optimization framework for robust low-rank tensor recovery."}
{"text": "Given data sampled from a number of variables, one is often interested in the underlying causal relationships in the form of a directed acyclic graph. In the general case, without interventions on some of the variables it is only possible to identify the graph up to its Markov equivalence class. However, in some situations one can find the true causal graph just from observational data, for example in structural equation models with additive noise and nonlinear edge functions. Most current methods for achieving this rely on nonparametric independence tests. One of the problems there is that the null hypothesis is independence, which is what one would like to get evidence for. We take a different approach in our work by using a penalized likelihood as a score for model selection. This is practically feasible in many settings and has the advantage of yielding a natural ranking of the candidate models. When making smoothness assumptions on the probability density space, we prove consistency of the penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We also present empirical results for simulated scenarios and real two-dimensional data sets (cause-effect pairs) where we obtain similar results as other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Non-orthogonal joint diagonalization (NJD) free of prewhitening has been widely studied in the context of blind source separation (BSS) and array signal processing, etc. However, NJD is used to retrieve the jointly diagonalizable structure for a single set of target matrices which are mostly formulized with a single dataset, and thus is insufficient to handle multiple datasets with inter-set dependences, a scenario often encountered in joint BSS (J-BSS) applications. As such, we present a generalized NJD (GNJD) algorithm to simultaneously perform asymmetric NJD upon multiple sets of target matrices with mutually linked loading matrices, by using LU decomposition and successive rotations, to enable J-BSS over multiple datasets with indication/exploitation of their mutual dependences. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "The performance of spectral clustering can be considerably improved via regularization, as demonstrated empirically in Amini et. al (2012). Here, we provide an attempt at quantifying this improvement through theoretical analysis. Under the stochastic block model (SBM), and its extensions, previous results on spectral clustering relied on the minimum degree of the graph being sufficiently large for its good performance. By examining the scenario where the regularization parameter $\\tau$ is large we show that the minimum degree assumption can potentially be removed. As a special case, for an SBM with two blocks, the results require the maximum degree to be large (grow faster than $\\log n$) as opposed to the minimum degree.   More importantly, we show the usefulness of regularization in situations where not all nodes belong to well-defined clusters. Our results rely on a `bias-variance'-like trade-off that arises from understanding the concentration of the sample Laplacian and the eigen gap as a function of the regularization parameter. As a byproduct of our bounds, we propose a data-driven technique \\textit{DKest} (standing for estimated Davis-Kahan bounds) for choosing the regularization parameter. This technique is shown to work well through simulations and on a real data set."}
{"text": "We present an exploration of the rich theoretical connections between several classes of regularized models, network flows, and recent results in submodular function theory. This work unifies key aspects of these problems under a common theory, leading to novel methods for working with several important models of interest in statistics, machine learning and computer vision.   In Part 1, we review the concepts of network flows and submodular function optimization theory foundational to our results. We then examine the connections between network flows and the minimum-norm algorithm from submodular optimization, extending and improving several current results. This leads to a concise representation of the structure of a large class of pairwise regularized models important in machine learning, statistics and computer vision.   In Part 2, we describe the full regularization path of a class of penalized regression problems with dependent variables that includes the graph-guided LASSO and total variation constrained models. This description also motivates a practical algorithm. This allows us to efficiently find the regularization path of the discretized version of TV penalized models. Ultimately, our new algorithms scale up to high-dimensional problems with millions of variables."}
{"text": "The question of how to determine the number of independent latent factors (topics) in mixture models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is of great practical importance. In most applications, the exact number of topics is unknown, and depends on the application and the size of the data set. Bayesian nonparametric methods can avoid the problem of topic number selection, but they can be impracticably slow for large sample sizes and are subject to local optima. We develop a guaranteed procedure for topic number recovery that does not necessitate learning the model's latent parameters beforehand. Our procedure relies on adapting results from random matrix theory. Performance of our topic number recovery procedure is superior to hLDA, a nonparametric method. We also discuss some implications of our results on the sample complexity and accuracy of popular spectral learning algorithms for LDA. Our results and procedure can be extended to spectral learning algorithms for other exchangeable mixture models as well as Hidden Markov Models."}
{"text": "This paper aims at justifying LWF and AMP chain graphs by showing that they do not represent arbitrary independence models. Specifically, we show that every chain graph is inclusion optimal wrt the intersection of the independence models represented by a set of directed and acyclic graphs under conditioning. This implies that the independence model represented by the chain graph can be accounted for by a set of causal models that are subject to selection bias, which in turn can be accounted for by a system that switches between different regimes or configurations."}
{"text": "The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difficulty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from first principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lovasz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random fields, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider specific graph models, the torus, k-nearest neighbor graphs, and epsilon-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the problem of filtering with a state-space model. Standard approaches for filtering assume that a probabilistic model for observations (i.e. the observation model) is given explicitly or at least parametrically. We consider a setting where this assumption is not satisfied; we assume that the knowledge of the observation model is only provided by examples of state-observation pairs. This setting is important and appears when state variables are defined as quantities that are very different from the observations. We propose Kernel Monte Carlo Filter, a novel filtering method that is focused on this setting. Our approach is based on the framework of kernel mean embeddings, which enables nonparametric posterior inference using the state-observation examples. The proposed method represents state distributions as weighted samples, propagates these samples by sampling, estimates the state posteriors by Kernel Bayes' Rule, and resamples by Kernel Herding. In particular, the sampling and resampling procedures are novel in being expressed using kernel mean embeddings, so we theoretically analyze their behaviors. We reveal the following properties, which are similar to those of corresponding procedures in particle methods: (1) the performance of sampling can degrade if the effective sample size of a weighted sample is small; (2) resampling improves the sampling performance by increasing the effective sample size. We first demonstrate these theoretical findings by synthetic experiments. Then we show the effectiveness of the proposed filter by artificial and real data experiments, which include vision-based mobile robot localization."}
{"text": "Real world systems typically feature a variety of different dependency types and topologies that complicate model selection for probabilistic graphical models. We introduce the ensemble-of-forests model, a generalization of the ensemble-of-trees model. Our model enables structure learning of Markov random fields (MRF) with multiple connected components and arbitrary potentials. We present two approximate inference techniques for this model and demonstrate their performance on synthetic data. Our results suggest that the ensemble-of-forests approach can accurately recover sparse, possibly disconnected MRF topologies, even in presence of non-Gaussian dependencies and/or low sample size. We applied the ensemble-of-forests model to learn the structure of perturbed signaling networks of immune cells and found that these frequently exhibit non-Gaussian dependencies with disconnected MRF topologies. In summary, we expect that the ensemble-of-forests model will enable MRF structure learning in other high dimensional real world settings that are governed by non-trivial dependencies."}
{"text": "We are concerned with an approximation problem for a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix due to motivation from a class of nonlinear machine learning methods. We discuss an approximation approach that we call {matrix ridge approximation}. In particular, we define the matrix ridge approximation as an incomplete matrix factorization plus a ridge term. Moreover, we present probabilistic interpretations using a normal latent variable model and a Wishart model for this approximation approach. The idea behind the latent variable model in turn leads us to an efficient EM iterative method for handling the matrix ridge approximation problem. Finally, we illustrate the applications of the approximation approach in multivariate data analysis. Empirical studies in spectral clustering and Gaussian process regression show that the matrix ridge approximation with the EM iteration is potentially useful."}
{"text": "In this paper we study nonconvex penalization using Bernstein functions. Since the Bernstein function is concave and nonsmooth at the origin, it can induce a class of nonconvex functions for high-dimensional sparse estimation problems. We derive a threshold function based on the Bernstein penalty and give its mathematical properties in sparsity modeling. We show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for penalized regression problems with the Bernstein penalty. Additionally, we prove that the Bernstein function can be defined as the concave conjugate of a $\\varphi$-divergence and develop a conjugate maximization algorithm for finding the sparse solution. Finally, we particularly exemplify a family of Bernstein nonconvex penalties based on a generalized Gamma measure and conduct empirical analysis for this family."}
{"text": "It is the main goal of this article to address the bipartite ranking issue from the perspective of functional data analysis (FDA). Given a training set of independent realizations of a (possibly sampled) second-order random function with a (locally) smooth autocorrelation structure and to which a binary label is randomly assigned, the objective is to learn a scoring function s with optimal ROC curve. Based on linear/nonlinear wavelet-based approximations, it is shown how to select compact finite dimensional representations of the input curves adaptively, in order to build accurate ranking rules, using recent advances in the ranking problem for multivariate data with binary feedback. Beyond theoretical considerations, the performance of the learning methods for functional bipartite ranking proposed in this paper are illustrated by numerical experiments."}
{"text": "Probabilistic models often have parameters that can be translated, scaled, permuted, or otherwise transformed without changing the model. These symmetries can lead to strong correlation and multimodality in the posterior distribution over the model's parameters, which can pose challenges both for performing inference and interpreting the results. In this work, we address the automatic detection of common problematic model symmetries. To do so, we introduce local symmetries, which cover many common cases and are amenable to automatic detection. We show how to derive algorithms to detect several broad classes of local symmetries. Our algorithms are compatible with probabilistic programming constructs such as arrays, for loops, and if statements, and they scale to models with many variables."}
{"text": "Modeling structure in complex networks using Bayesian non-parametrics makes it possible to specify flexible model structures and infer the adequate model complexity from the observed data. This paper provides a gentle introduction to non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks: Using an infinite mixture model as running example we go through the steps of deriving the model as an infinite limit of a finite parametric model, inferring the model parameters by Markov chain Monte Carlo, and checking the model's fit and predictive performance. We explain how advanced non-parametric models for complex networks can be derived and point out relevant literature."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose an outlier-robust regularized kernel-based method for linear system identification. The unknown impulse response is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) is given by the recently proposed stable spline kernel, which encodes information on regularity and exponential stability. To build robustness to outliers, we model the measurement noise as realizations of independent Laplacian random variables. The identification problem is cast in a Bayesian framework, and solved by a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme. In particular, exploiting the representation of the Laplacian random variables as scale mixtures of Gaussians, we design a Gibbs sampler which quickly converges to the target distribution. Numerical simulations show a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the estimates over state-of-the-art kernel-based methods."}
{"text": "We consider a problem of clustering a sequence of multinomial observations by way of a model selection criterion. We propose a form of a penalty term for the model selection procedure. Our approach subsumes both the conventional AIC and BIC criteria but also extends the conventional criteria in a way that it can be applicable also to a sequence of sparse multinomial observations, where even within a same cluster, the number of multinomial trials may be different for different observations. In addition, as a preliminary estimation step to maximum likelihood estimation, and more generally, to maximum $L_{q}$ estimation, we propose to use reduced rank projection in combination with non-negative factorization. We motivate our approach by showing that our model selection criterion and preliminary estimation step yield consistent estimates under simplifying assumptions. We also illustrate our approach through numerical experiments using real and simulated data."}
{"text": "Archetypal analysis represents a set of observations as convex combinations of pure patterns, or archetypes. The original geometric formulation of finding archetypes by approximating the convex hull of the observations assumes them to be real valued. This, unfortunately, is not compatible with many practical situations. In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better."}
{"text": "Multi-task learning has shown to significantly enhance the performance of multiple related learning tasks in a variety of situations. We present the fused logistic regression, a sparse multi-task learning approach for binary classification. Specifically, we introduce sparsity inducing penalties over parameter differences of related logistic regression models to encode similarity across related tasks. The resulting joint learning task is cast into a form that lends itself to be efficiently optimized with a recursive variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers. We show results on synthetic data and describe the regime of settings where our multi-task approach achieves significant improvements over the single task learning approach and discuss the implications on applying the fused logistic regression in different real world settings."}
{"text": "We consider forward-backward greedy algorithms for solving sparse feature selection problems with general convex smooth functions. A state-of-the-art greedy method, the Forward-Backward greedy algorithm (FoBa-obj) requires to solve a large number of optimization problems, thus it is not scalable for large-size problems. The FoBa-gdt algorithm, which uses the gradient information for feature selection at each forward iteration, significantly improves the efficiency of FoBa-obj. In this paper, we systematically analyze the theoretical properties of both forward-backward greedy algorithms. Our main contributions are: 1) We derive better theoretical bounds than existing analyses regarding FoBa-obj for general smooth convex functions; 2) We show that FoBa-gdt achieves the same theoretical performance as FoBa-obj under the same condition: restricted strong convexity condition. Our new bounds are consistent with the bounds of a special case (least squares) and fills a previously existing theoretical gap for general convex smooth functions; 3) We show that the restricted strong convexity condition is satisfied if the number of independent samples is more than $\\bar{k}\\log d$ where $\\bar{k}$ is the sparsity number and $d$ is the dimension of the variable; 4) We apply FoBa-gdt (with the conditional random field objective) to the sensor selection problem for human indoor activity recognition and our results show that FoBa-gdt outperforms other methods (including the ones based on forward greedy selection and L1-regularization)."}
{"text": "It is the main goal of this paper to propose a novel method to perform matrix completion on-line. Motivated by a wide variety of applications, ranging from the design of recommender systems to sensor network localization through seismic data reconstruction, we consider the matrix completion problem when entries of the matrix of interest are observed gradually. Precisely, we place ourselves in the situation where the predictive rule should be refined incrementally, rather than recomputed from scratch each time the sample of observed entries increases. The extension of existing matrix completion methods to the sequential prediction context is indeed a major issue in the Big Data era, and yet little addressed in the literature. The algorithm promoted in this article builds upon the Soft Impute approach introduced in Mazumder et al. (2010). The major novelty essentially arises from the use of a randomised technique for both computing and updating the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) involved in the algorithm. Though of disarming simplicity, the method proposed turns out to be very efficient, while requiring reduced computations. Several numerical experiments based on real datasets illustrating its performance are displayed, together with preliminary results giving it a theoretical basis."}
{"text": "A new shrinkage-based construction is developed for a compressible vector $\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$, for cases in which the components of $\\xv$ are naturally associated with a tree structure. Important examples are when $\\xv$ corresponds to the coefficients of a wavelet or block-DCT representation of data. The method we consider in detail, and for which numerical results are presented, is based on increments of a gamma process. However, we demonstrate that the general framework is appropriate for many other types of shrinkage priors, all within the L\\'{e}vy process family, with the gamma process a special case. Bayesian inference is carried out by approximating the posterior with samples from an MCMC algorithm, as well as by constructing a heuristic variational approximation to the posterior. We also consider expectation-maximization (EM) for a MAP (point) solution. State-of-the-art results are manifested for compressive sensing and denoising applications, the latter with spiky (non-Gaussian) noise."}
{"text": "Recently, a number of mostly $\\ell_1$-norm regularized least squares type deterministic algorithms have been proposed to address the problem of \\emph{sparse} adaptive signal estimation and system identification. From a Bayesian perspective, this task is equivalent to maximum a posteriori probability estimation under a sparsity promoting heavy-tailed prior for the parameters of interest. Following a different approach, this paper develops a unifying framework of sparse \\emph{variational Bayes} algorithms that employ heavy-tailed priors in conjugate hierarchical form to facilitate posterior inference. The resulting fully automated variational schemes are first presented in a batch iterative form. Then it is shown that by properly exploiting the structure of the batch estimation task, new sparse adaptive variational Bayes algorithms can be derived, which have the ability to impose and track sparsity during real-time processing in a time-varying environment. The most important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they completely eliminate the need for computationally costly parameter fine-tuning, a necessary ingredient of sparse adaptive deterministic algorithms. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sparse variational Bayes algorithms against state-of-the-art deterministic techniques for adaptive channel estimation. The results show that the proposed algorithms are numerically robust and exhibit in general superior estimation performance compared to their deterministic counterparts."}
{"text": "In this work we consider the problem of detecting anomalous spatio-temporal behavior in videos. Our approach is to learn the normative multiframe pixel joint distribution and detect deviations from it using a likelihood based approach. Due to the extreme lack of available training samples relative to the dimension of the distribution, we use a mean and covariance approach and consider methods of learning the spatio-temporal covariance in the low-sample regime. Our approach is to estimate the covariance using parameter reduction and sparse models. The first method considered is the representation of the covariance as a sum of Kronecker products as in (Greenewald et al 2013), which is found to be an accurate approximation in this setting. We propose learning algorithms relevant to our problem. We then consider the sparse multiresolution model of (Choi et al 2010) and apply the Kronecker product methods to it for further parameter reduction, as well as introducing modifications for enhanced efficiency and greater applicability to spatio-temporal covariance matrices. We apply our methods to the detection of crowd behavior anomalies in the University of Minnesota crowd anomaly dataset, and achieve competitive results."}
{"text": "In this survey, we present and compare different approaches to estimate Mutual Information (MI) from data to analyse general dependencies between variables of interest in a system. We demonstrate the performance difference of MI versus correlation analysis, which is only optimal in case of linear dependencies. First, we use a piece-wise constant Bayesian methodology using a general Dirichlet prior. In this estimation method, we use a two-stage approach where we approximate the probability distribution first and then calculate the marginal and joint entropies. Here, we demonstrate the performance of this Bayesian approach versus the others for computing the dependency between different variables. We also compare these with linear correlation analysis. Finally, we apply MI and correlation analysis to the identification of the bias in the determination of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) by the satellite based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the ground based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Here, we observe that the AOD measurements by these two instruments might be different for the same location. The reason of this bias is explored by quantifying the dependencies between the bias and 15 other variables including cloud cover, surface reflectivity and others."}
{"text": "Tree structured graphical models are powerful at expressing long range or hierarchical dependency among many variables, and have been widely applied in different areas of computer science and statistics. However, existing methods for parameter estimation, inference, and structure learning mainly rely on the Gaussian or discrete assumptions, which are restrictive under many applications. In this paper, we propose new nonparametric methods based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space embeddings of distributions that can recover the latent tree structures, estimate the parameters, and perform inference for high dimensional continuous and non-Gaussian variables. The usefulness of the proposed methods are illustrated by thorough numerical results."}
{"text": "Visual rendering of graphs is a key task in the mapping of complex network data. Although most graph drawing algorithms emphasize aesthetic appeal, certain applications such as travel-time maps place more importance on visualization of structural network properties. The present paper advocates two graph embedding approaches with centrality considerations to comply with node hierarchy. The problem is formulated first as one of constrained multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and it is solved via block coordinate descent iterations with successive approximations and guaranteed convergence to a KKT point. In addition, a regularization term enforcing graph smoothness is incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. A second approach leverages the locally-linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which assumes that the graph encodes data sampled from a low-dimensional manifold. Closed-form solutions to the resulting centrality-constrained optimization problems are determined yielding meaningful embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both approaches, especially for visualizing large networks on the order of thousands of nodes."}
{"text": "Undirected graphical models known as Markov networks are popular for a wide variety of applications ranging from statistical physics to computational biology. Traditionally, learning of the network structure has been done under the assumption of chordality which ensures that efficient scoring methods can be used. In general, non-chordal graphs have intractable normalizing constants which renders the calculation of Bayesian and other scores difficult beyond very small-scale systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest towards the use of regularized pseudo-likelihood methods for structural learning of large-scale Markov network models, as such an approach avoids the assumption of chordality. The currently available methods typically necessitate the use of a tuning parameter to adapt the level of regularization for a particular dataset, which can be optimized for example by cross-validation. Here we introduce a Bayesian version of pseudo-likelihood scoring of Markov networks, which enables an automatic regularization through marginalization over the nuisance parameters in the model. We prove consistency of the resulting MPL estimator for the network structure via comparison with the pseudo information criterion. Identification of the MPL-optimal network on a prescanned graph space is considered with both greedy hill climbing and exact pseudo-Boolean optimization algorithms. We find that for reasonable sample sizes the hill climbing approach most often identifies networks that are at a negligible distance from the restricted global optimum. Using synthetic and existing benchmark networks, the marginal pseudo-likelihood method is shown to generally perform favorably against recent popular inference methods for Markov networks."}
{"text": "This paper proposes a novel scheme for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. On this approximate eigenbasis the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$ (initial) and $\\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ (hyperparameter learning) with $m$ basis functions and $n$ data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function is increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by ${\\sim}1/m$ regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data."}
{"text": "The notion of causality is used in many situations dealing with uncertainty. We consider the problem whether causality can be identified given data set generated by discrete random variables rather than continuous ones. In particular, for non-binary data, thus far it was only known that causality can be identified except rare cases. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient condition for an integer modular acyclic additive noise (IMAN) of two variables. In addition, we relate bivariate and multivariate causal identifiability in a more explicit manner, and develop a practical algorithm to find the order of variables and their parent sets. We demonstrate its performance in applications to artificial data and real world body motion data with comparisons to conventional methods."}
{"text": "The Laplace approximation calls for the computation of second derivatives at the likelihood maximum. When the maximum is found by the EM-algorithm, there is a convenient way to compute these derivatives. The likelihood gradient can be obtained from the EM-auxiliary, while the Hessian can be obtained from this gradient with the Pearlmutter trick."}
{"text": "In a recent paper, it is shown that the LASSO algorithm exhibits \"near-ideal behavior,\" in the following sense: Suppose $y = Az + \\eta$ where $A$ satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with a sufficiently small constant, and $\\Vert \\eta \\Vert_2 \\leq \\epsilon$. Then minimizing $\\Vert z \\Vert_1$ subject to $\\Vert y - Az \\Vert_2 \\leq \\epsilon$ leads to an estimate $\\hat{x}$ whose error $\\Vert \\hat{x} - x \\Vert_2$ is bounded by a universal constant times the error achieved by an \"oracle\" that knows the location of the nonzero components of $x$. In the world of optimization, the LASSO algorithm has been generalized in several directions such as the group LASSO, the sparse group LASSO, either without or with tree-structured overlapping groups, and most recently, the sorted LASSO. In this paper, it is shown that {\\it any algorithm\\/} exhibits near-ideal behavior in the above sense, provided only that (i) the norm used to define the sparsity index is \"decomposable,\" (ii) the penalty norm that is minimized in an effort to enforce sparsity is \"$\\gamma$-decomposable,\" and (iii) a \"compressibility condition\" in terms of a group restricted isometry property is satisfied. Specifically, the group LASSO, and the sparse group LASSO (with some permissible overlap in the groups), as well as the sorted $\\ell_1$-norm minimization all exhibit near-ideal behavior. Explicit bounds on the residual error are derived that contain previously known results as special cases."}
{"text": "Sparse classifiers such as the support vector machines (SVM) are efficient in test-phases because the classifier is characterized only by a subset of the samples called support vectors (SVs), and the rest of the samples (non SVs) have no influence on the classification result. However, the advantage of the sparsity has not been fully exploited in training phases because it is generally difficult to know which sample turns out to be SV beforehand. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called safe sample screening that enables us to identify a subset of the non-SVs and screen them out prior to the training phase. Our approach is different from existing heuristic approaches in the sense that the screened samples are guaranteed to be non-SVs at the optimal solution. We investigate the advantage of the safe sample screening approach through intensive numerical experiments, and demonstrate that it can substantially decrease the computational cost of the state-of-the-art SVM solvers such as LIBSVM. In the current big data era, we believe that safe sample screening would be of great practical importance since the data size can be reduced without sacrificing the optimality of the final solution."}
{"text": "In this paper we demonstrate that tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for Bayesian models by recursively subsampling observations without replacement can improve the performance of baseline samplers in terms of effective sample size per computation. We present two tempering by subsampling algorithms, subsampled parallel tempering and subsampled tempered transitions. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the computational cost of tempering by subsampling, verify that tempering by subsampling costs less than traditional tempering, and demonstrate both algorithms on Bayesian approaches to learning the mean of a high dimensional multivariate Normal and estimating Gaussian process hyperparameters."}
{"text": "This paper is about variable selection, clustering and estimation in an unsupervised high-dimensional setting. Our approach is based on fitting constrained Gaussian mixture models, where we learn the number of clusters $K$ and the set of relevant variables $S$ using a generalized Bayesian posterior with a sparsity inducing prior. We prove a sparsity oracle inequality which shows that this procedure selects the optimal parameters $K$ and $S$. This procedure is implemented using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, based on a clustering-oriented greedy proposal, which makes the convergence to the posterior very fast."}
{"text": "This paper presents a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) framework for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency between a structured input space and a structured output space. Our formulation encompasses both Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Co-regularized Multi-view Learning, providing in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of the least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution, which is obtained by solving a system of linear equations. In the case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, our formulation generalizes in particular both the binary Laplacian SVM to the multi-class, multi-view settings and the multi-class Simplex Cone SVM to the semi-supervised, multi-view settings. The solution is obtained by solving a single quadratic optimization problem, as in standard SVM, via the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) approach. Empirical results obtained on the task of object recognition, using several challenging datasets, demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithms compared with other state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "An inductive probabilistic classification rule must generally obey the principles of Bayesian predictive inference, such that all observed and unobserved stochastic quantities are jointly modeled and the parameter uncertainty is fully acknowledged through the posterior predictive distribution. Several such rules have been recently considered and their asymptotic behavior has been characterized under the assumption that the observed features or variables used for building a classifier are conditionally independent given a simultaneous labeling of both the training samples and those from an unknown origin. Here we extend the theoretical results to predictive classifiers acknowledging feature dependencies either through graphical models or sparser alternatives defined as stratified graphical models. We also show through experimentation with both synthetic and real data that the predictive classifiers based on stratified graphical models have consistently best accuracy compared with the predictive classifiers based on either conditionally independent features or on ordinary graphical models."}
{"text": "In this tutorial we explain the inference procedures developed for the sparse Gaussian process (GP) regression and Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM). Due to page limit the derivation given in Titsias (2009) and Titsias & Lawrence (2010) is brief, hence getting a full picture of it requires collecting results from several different sources and a substantial amount of algebra to fill-in the gaps. Our main goal is thus to collect all the results and full derivations into one place to help speed up understanding this work. In doing so we present a re-parametrisation of the inference that allows it to be carried out in parallel. A secondary goal for this document is, therefore, to accompany our paper and open-source implementation of the parallel inference scheme for the models. We hope that this document will bridge the gap between the equations as implemented in code and those published in the original papers, in order to make it easier to extend existing work. We assume prior knowledge of Gaussian processes and variational inference, but we also include references for further reading where appropriate."}
{"text": "Practical model building processes are often time-consuming because many different models must be trained and validated. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that can be used for computing the lower and the upper bounds of model validation errors without actually training the model itself. A key idea behind our algorithm is using a side information available from a suboptimal model. If a reasonably good suboptimal model is available, our algorithm can compute lower and upper bounds of many useful quantities for making inferences on the unknown target model. We demonstrate the advantage of our algorithm in the context of model selection for regularized learning problems."}
{"text": "Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI) is a new approach to distinguish between cause and effect for two variables. It is based on an independence assumption between input distribution and causal mechanism that can be phrased in terms of orthogonality in information space. We describe two intuitive reinterpretations of this approach that makes IGCI more accessible to a broader audience.   Moreover, we show that the described independence is related to the hypothesis that unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning only works for predicting the cause from the effect and not vice versa."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of dictionary learning under the assumption that the observed signals can be represented as sparse linear combinations of the columns of a single large dictionary matrix. In particular, we analyze the minimax risk of the dictionary learning problem which governs the mean squared error (MSE) performance of any learning scheme, regardless of its computational complexity. By following an established information-theoretic method based on Fanos inequality, we derive a lower bound on the minimax risk for a given dictionary learning problem. This lower bound yields a characterization of the sample-complexity, i.e., a lower bound on the required number of observations such that consistent dictionary learning schemes exist. Our bounds may be compared with the performance of a given learning scheme, allowing to characterize how far the method is from optimal performance."}
{"text": "A new non parametric approach to the problem of testing the independence of two random process is developed. The test statistic is the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which was used previously in testing independence for i.i.d pairs of variables. The asymptotic behaviour of HSIC is established when computed from samples drawn from random processes. It is shown that earlier bootstrap procedures which worked in the i.i.d. case will fail for random processes, and an alternative consistent estimate of the p-values is proposed. Tests on artificial data and real-world Forex data indicate that the new test procedure discovers dependence which is missed by linear approaches, while the earlier bootstrap procedure returns an elevated number of false positives. The code is available online: https://github.com/kacperChwialkowski/HSIC ."}
{"text": "We propose a new high dimensional semiparametric principal component analysis (PCA) method, named Copula Component Analysis (COCA). The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspecified marginally monotone transformations, the distributions are multivariate Gaussian. COCA improves upon PCA and sparse PCA in three aspects: (i) It is robust to modeling assumptions; (ii) It is robust to outliers and data contamination; (iii) It is scale-invariant and yields more interpretable results. We prove that the COCA estimators obtain fast estimation rates and are feature selection consistent when the dimension is nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size. Careful experiments confirm that COCA outperforms sparse PCA on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}

These generic features should perform as well as the best hand crafted features for any learning problem that makes use of this data. We provide a definition of generic features, characterize when it is possible to learn them and provide methods closely related to the autoencoder and deep belief network of deep learning. In order to do so we use the notion of deficiency and illustrate its value in studying certain general learning problems."}
{"text": "In this paper, we are concerned with obtaining distribution-free concentration inequalities for mixture of independent Bernoulli variables that incorporate a notion of variance. Missing mass is the total probability mass associated to the outcomes that have not been seen in a given sample which is an important quantity that connects density estimates obtained from a sample to the population for discrete distributions. Therefore, we are specifically motivated to apply our method to study the concentration of missing mass - which can be expressed as a mixture of Bernoulli - in a novel way.   We not only derive - for the first time - Bernstein-like large deviation bounds for the missing mass whose exponents behave almost linearly with respect to deviation size, but also sharpen McAllester and Ortiz (2003) and Berend and Kontorovich (2013) for large sample sizes in the case of small deviations which is the most interesting case in learning theory. In the meantime, our approach shows that the heterogeneity issue introduced in McAllester and Ortiz (2003) is resolvable in the case of missing mass in the sense that one can use standard inequalities but it may not lead to strong results. Thus, we postulate that our results are general and can be applied to provide potentially sharp Bernstein-like bounds under some constraints."}

{"text": "The $k$-support norm is a regularizer which has been successfully applied to sparse vector prediction problems. We show that it belongs to a general class of norms which can be formulated as a parameterized infimum over quadratics. We further extend the $k$-support norm to matrices, and we observe that it is a special case of the matrix cluster norm. Using this formulation we derive an efficient algorithm to compute the proximity operator of both norms. This improves upon the standard algorithm for the $k$-support norm and allows us to apply proximal gradient methods to the cluster norm. We also describe how to solve regularization problems which employ centered versions of these norms. Finally, we apply the matrix regularizers to different matrix completion and multitask learning datasets. Our results indicate that the spectral $k$-support norm and the cluster norm give state of the art performance on these problems, significantly outperforming trace norm and elastic net penalties."}
{"text": "We present a nonparametric prior over reversible Markov chains. We use completely random measures, specifically gamma processes, to construct a countably infinite graph with weighted edges. By enforcing symmetry to make the edges undirected we define a prior over random walks on graphs that results in a reversible Markov chain. The resulting prior over infinite transition matrices is closely related to the hierarchical Dirichlet process but enforces reversibility. A reinforcement scheme has recently been proposed with similar properties, but the de Finetti measure is not well characterised. We take the alternative approach of explicitly constructing the mixing measure, which allows more straightforward and efficient inference at the cost of no longer having a closed form predictive distribution. We use our process to construct a reversible infinite HMM which we apply to two real datasets, one from epigenomics and one ion channel recording."}
{"text": "The Lasso is a computationally efficient regression regularization procedure that can produce sparse estimators when the number of predictors (p) is large. Oracle inequalities provide probability loss bounds for the Lasso estimator at a deterministic choice of the regularization parameter. These bounds tend to zero if p is appropriately controlled, and are thus commonly cited as theoretical justification for the Lasso and its ability to handle high-dimensional settings. Unfortunately, in practice the regularization parameter is not selected to be a deterministic quantity, but is instead chosen using a random, data-dependent procedure. To address this shortcoming of previous theoretical work, we study the loss of the Lasso estimator when tuned optimally for prediction. Assuming orthonormal predictors and a sparse true model, we prove that the probability that the best possible predictive performance of the Lasso deteriorates as p increases is positive and can be arbitrarily close to one given a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio and sufficiently large p. We further demonstrate empirically that the amount of deterioration in performance can be far worse than the oracle inequalities suggest and provide a real data example where deterioration is observed."}
{"text": "In the synthesis model signals are represented as a sparse combinations of atoms from a dictionary. Dictionary learning describes the acquisition process of the underlying dictionary for a given set of training samples. While ideally this would be achieved by optimizing the expectation of the factors over the underlying distribution of the training data, in practice the necessary information about the distribution is not available. Therefore, in real world applications it is achieved by minimizing an empirical average over the available samples. The main goal of this paper is to provide a sample complexity estimate that controls to what extent the empirical average deviates from the cost function. This estimate then provides a suitable estimate to the accuracy of the representation of the learned dictionary. The presented approach exemplifies the general results proposed by the authors in Sample Complexity of Dictionary Learning and other Matrix Factorizations, Gribonval et al. and gives more concrete bounds of the sample complexity of dictionary learning. We cover a variety of sparsity measures employed in the learning procedure."}
{"text": "We present a supervised-learning algorithm from graph data (a set of graphs) for arbitrary twice-differentiable loss functions and sparse linear models over all possible subgraph features. To date, it has been shown that under all possible subgraph features, several types of sparse learning, such as Adaboost, LPBoost, LARS/LASSO, and sparse PLS regression, can be performed. Particularly emphasis is placed on simultaneous learning of relevant features from an infinite set of candidates. We first generalize techniques used in all these preceding studies to derive an unifying bounding technique for arbitrary separable functions. We then carefully use this bounding to make block coordinate gradient descent feasible over infinite subgraph features, resulting in a fast converging algorithm that can solve a wider class of sparse learning problems over graph data. We also empirically study the differences from the existing approaches in convergence property, selected subgraph features, and search-space sizes. We further discuss several unnoticed issues in sparse learning over all possible subgraph features."}
{"text": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be identifiable under the separability assumption, under which all the columns(or rows) of the input data matrix belong to the convex cone generated by only a few of these columns(or rows) [1]. In real applications, however, such separability assumption is hard to satisfy. Following [4] and [5], in this paper, we look at the Linear Programming (LP) based reformulation to locate the extreme rays of the convex cone but in a noisy setting. Furthermore, in order to deal with the large scale data, we employ First-Order Methods (FOM) to mitigate the computational complexity of LP, which primarily results from a large number of constraints. We show the performance of the algorithm on real and synthetic data sets."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider low rank matrix estimation using either matrix-version Dantzig Selector $\\hat{A}_{\\lambda}^d$ or matrix-version LASSO estimator $\\hat{A}_{\\lambda}^L$.

As a direct corollary, we show both upper bounds and minimax lower bounds of estimation accuracy under Ky-Fan-k norms for every $1\\leq k\\leq m$."}
{"text": "The motivation of this work is to improve the performance of standard stacking approaches or ensembles, which are composed of simple, heterogeneous base models, through the integration of the generation and selection stages for regression problems. We propose two extensions to the standard stacking approach. In the first extension we combine a set of standard stacking approaches into an ensemble of ensembles using a two-step ensemble learning in the regression setting. The second extension consists of two parts. In the initial part a diversity mechanism is injected into the original training data set, systematically generating different training subsets or partitions, and corresponding ensembles of ensembles. In the final part after measuring the quality of the different partitions or ensembles, a max-min rule-based selection algorithm is used to select the most appropriate ensemble/partition on which to make the final prediction. We show, based on experiments over a broad range of data sets, that the second extension performs better than the best of the standard stacking approaches, and is as good as the oracle of databases, which has the best base model selected by cross-validation for each data set. In addition to that, the second extension performs better than two state-of-the-art ensemble methods for regression, and it is as good as a third state-of-the-art ensemble method."}
{"text": "We connect shift-invariant characteristic kernels to infinitely divisible distributions on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Characteristic kernels play an important role in machine learning applications with their kernel means to distinguish any two probability measures. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we show, using the L\\'evy-Khintchine formula, that any shift-invariant kernel given by a bounded, continuous and symmetric probability density function (pdf) of an infinitely divisible distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is characteristic. We also present some closure property of such characteristic kernels under addition, pointwise product, and convolution. Second, in developing various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to compute the following values: (i) kernel mean values $m_P(x)$, $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, and (ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products ${\\left\\langle m_P, m_Q \\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}}$, for probability measures $P, Q$. If $P, Q$, and kernel $k$ are Gaussians, then computation (i) and (ii) results in Gaussian pdfs that is tractable. We generalize this Gaussian combination to more general cases in the class of infinitely divisible distributions. We then introduce a {\\it conjugate} kernel and {\\it convolution trick}, so that the above (i) and (ii) have the same pdf form, expecting tractable computation at least in some cases. As specific instances, we explore $\\alpha$-stable distributions and a rich class of generalized hyperbolic distributions, where the Laplace, Cauchy and Student-t distributions are included."}
{"text": "Bayesian networks are convenient graphical expressions for high dimensional probability distributions representing complex relationships between a large number of random variables. They have been employed extensively in areas such as bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, diagnosis, and risk management. The recovery of the structure of a network from data is of prime importance for the purposes of modeling, analysis, and prediction. Most recovery algorithms in the literature assume either discrete of continuous but Gaussian data. For general continuous data, discretization is usually employed but often destroys the very structure one is out to recover. Friedman and Goldszmidt suggest an approach based on the minimum description length principle that chooses a discretization which preserves the information in the original data set, however it is one which is difficult, if not impossible, to implement for even moderately sized networks. In this paper we provide an extremely efficient search strategy which allows one to use the Friedman and Goldszmidt discretization in practice."}
{"text": "This paper considers the problem of estimating the structure of multiple related directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. Building on recent developments in exact estimation of DAGs using integer linear programming (ILP), we present an ILP approach for joint estimation over multiple DAGs, that does not require that the vertices in each DAG share a common ordering. Furthermore, we allow also for (potentially unknown) dependency structure between the DAGs. Results are presented on both simulated data and fMRI data obtained from multiple subjects."}
{"text": "We propose a method for inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a high-dimensional Gaussian vector time series (discrete-time process) from a finite-length observation. By contrast to existing approaches, we do not rely on a parametric process model (such as, e.g., an autoregressive model) for the observed random process. Instead, we only require certain smoothness properties (in the Fourier domain) of the process. The proposed inference scheme works even for sample sizes much smaller than the number of scalar process components if the true underlying CIG is sufficiently sparse. A theoretical performance analysis provides conditions which guarantee that the probability of the proposed inference method to deliver a wrong CIG is below a prescribed value. These conditions imply lower bounds on the sample size such that the new method is consistent asymptotically. Some numerical experiments validate our theoretical performance analysis and demonstrate superior performance of our scheme compared to an existing (parametric) approach in case of model mismatch."}
{"text": "Given $iid$ observations from an unknown absolute continuous distribution defined on some domain $\\Omega$, we propose a nonparametric method to learn a piecewise constant function to approximate the underlying probability density function. Our density estimate is a piecewise constant function defined on a binary partition of $\\Omega$. The key ingredient of the algorithm is to use discrepancy, a concept originates from Quasi Monte Carlo analysis, to control the partition process. The resulting algorithm is simple, efficient, and has a provable convergence rate. We empirically demonstrate its efficiency as a density estimation method. We present its applications on a wide range of tasks, including finding good initializations for k-means."}
{"text": "We address structured covariance estimation in elliptical distributions by assuming that the covariance is a priori known to belong to a given convex set, e.g., the set of Toeplitz or banded matrices. We consider the General Method of Moments (GMM) optimization applied to robust Tyler's scatter M-estimator subject to these convex constraints. Unfortunately, GMM turns out to be non-convex due to the objective. Instead, we propose a new COCA estimator - a convex relaxation which can be efficiently solved. We prove that the relaxation is tight in the unconstrained case for a finite number of samples, and in the constrained case asymptotically. We then illustrate the advantages of COCA in synthetic simulations with structured compound Gaussian distributions. In these examples, COCA outperforms competing methods such as Tyler's estimator and its projection onto the structure set."}
{"text": "We describe a simple, efficient, permutation based procedure for selecting the penalty parameter in the LASSO. The procedure, which is intended for applications where variable selection is the primary focus, can be applied in a variety of structural settings, including generalized linear models. We briefly discuss connections between permutation selection and existing theory for the LASSO. In addition, we present a simulation study and an analysis of three real data sets in which permutation selection is compared with cross-validation (CV), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and a selection method based on recently developed testing procedures for the LASSO."}
{"text": "Predicting an individual's risk of experiencing a future clinical outcome is a statistical task with important consequences for both practicing clinicians and public health experts. Modern observational databases such as electronic health records (EHRs) provide an alternative to the longitudinal cohort studies traditionally used to construct risk models, bringing with them both opportunities and challenges. Large sample sizes and detailed covariate histories enable the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques to uncover complex associations and interactions, but observational databases are often ``messy,'' with high levels of missing data and incomplete patient follow-up. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the well-known Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning approach for classification to time-to-event outcomes subject to censoring. We compare the predictive performance of our method to the Cox proportional hazards model which is commonly used for risk prediction in healthcare populations, and illustrate its application to prediction of cardiovascular risk using an EHR dataset from a large Midwest integrated healthcare system."}
{"text": "Mean shift clustering finds the modes of the data probability density by identifying the zero points of the density gradient. Since it does not require to fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular clustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of the mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation and then compute its gradient. However, since good density estimation does not necessarily imply accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect two-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to directly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density estimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus is computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point algorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean shift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance. We empirically show that the proposed clustering method works much better than the mean shift especially for high-dimensional data. Experimental results further indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing clustering methods."}
{"text": "This paper presents a novel approach for approximate integration over the uncertainty of noise and signal variances in Gaussian process (GP) regression. Our efficient and straightforward approach can also be applied to integration over input dependent noise variance (heteroscedasticity) and input dependent signal variance (nonstationarity) by setting independent GP priors for the noise and signal variances. We use expectation propagation (EP) for inference and compare results to Markov chain Monte Carlo in two simulated data sets and three empirical examples. The results show that EP produces comparable results with less computational burden."}
{"text": "We focus on an interpolation method referred to Bayesian reconstruction in this paper. Whereas in standard interpolation methods missing data are interpolated deterministically, in Bayesian reconstruction, missing data are interpolated probabilistically using a Bayesian treatment. In this paper, we address the framework of Bayesian reconstruction and its application to the traffic data reconstruction problem in the field of traffic engineering. In the latter part of this paper, we describe the evaluation of the statistical performance of our Bayesian traffic reconstruction model using a statistical mechanical approach and clarify its statistical behavior."}
{"text": "Graphical models are commonly used tools for modeling multivariate random variables. While there exist many convenient multivariate distributions such as Gaussian distribution for continuous data, mixed data with the presence of discrete variables or a combination of both continuous and discrete variables poses new challenges in statistical modeling. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric model named latent Gaussian copula model for binary and mixed data. The observed binary data are assumed to be obtained by dichotomizing a latent variable satisfying the Gaussian copula distribution or the nonparanormal distribution. The latent Gaussian model with the assumption that the latent variables are multivariate Gaussian is a special case of the proposed model. A novel rank-based approach is proposed for both latent graph estimation and latent principal component analysis. Theoretically, the proposed methods achieve the same rates of convergence for both precision matrix estimation and eigenvector estimation, as if the latent variables were observed. Under similar conditions, the consistency of graph structure recovery and feature selection for leading eigenvectors is established. The performance of the proposed methods is numerically assessed through simulation studies, and the usage of our methods is illustrated by a genetic dataset."}
{"text": "We propose a novel non-parametric adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional data based on rank-SVM. Data points are first ranked based on scores derived from nearest neighbor graphs on n-point nominal data. We then train a rank-SVM using this ranked data. A test-point is declared as an anomaly at alpha-false alarm level if the predicted score is in the alpha-percentile. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal and adaptive in that for any false alarm rate alpha, its decision region converges to the alpha-percentile level set of the unknown underlying density. In addition we illustrate through a number of synthetic and real-data experiments both the statistical performance and computational efficiency of our anomaly detector."}
{"text": "We study a novel spline-like basis, which we name the \"falling factorial basis\", bearing many similarities to the classic truncated power basis. The advantage of the falling factorial basis is that it enables rapid, linear-time computations in basis matrix multiplication and basis matrix inversion. The falling factorial functions are not actually splines, but are close enough to splines that they provably retain some of the favorable properties of the latter functions. We examine their application in two problems: trend filtering over arbitrary input points, and a higher-order variant of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test."}
{"text": "When I first encountered PAC-Bayesian concentration inequalities they seemed to me to be rather disconnected from good old-fashioned results like Hoeffding's and Bernstein's inequalities. But, at least for one flavour of the PAC-Bayesian bounds, there is actually a very close relation, and the main innovation is a continuous version of the union bound, along with some ingenious applications. Here's the gist of what's going on, presented from a machine learning perspective."}
{"text": "Additive models play an important role in semiparametric statistics. This paper gives learning rates for regularized kernel based methods for additive models. These learning rates compare favourably in particular in high dimensions to recent results on optimal learning rates for purely nonparametric regularized kernel based quantile regression using the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, provided the assumption of an additive model is valid. Additionally, a concrete example is presented to show that a Gaussian function depending only on one variable lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by an additive Gaussian kernel, but does not belong to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by the multivariate Gaussian kernel of the same variance."}
{"text": "We propose a new two stage algorithm LING for large scale regression problems. LING has the same risk as the well known Ridge Regression under the fixed design setting and can be computed much faster. Our experiments have shown that LING performs well in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared with other large scale regression algorithms like Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Principal Component Regression on both simulated and real datasets."}
{"text": "Bayesian mixture models are widely applied for unsupervised learning and exploratory data analysis. Markov chain Monte Carlo based on Gibbs sampling and split-merge moves are widely used for inference in these models. However, both methods are restricted to limited types of transitions and suffer from torpid mixing and low accept rates even for problems of modest size. We propose a method that considers a broader range of transitions that are close to equilibrium by exploiting multiple chains in parallel and using the past states adaptively to inform the proposal distribution. The method significantly improves on Gibbs and split-merge sampling as quantified using convergence diagnostics and acceptance rates. Adaptive MCMC methods which use past states to inform the proposal distribution has given rise to many ingenious sampling schemes for continuous problems and the present work can be seen as an important first step in bringing these benefits to partition-based problems"}
{"text": "One of the most fundamental problems in causal inference is the estimation of a causal effect when variables are confounded. This is difficult in an observational study, because one has no direct evidence that all confounders have been adjusted for. We introduce a novel approach for estimating causal effects that exploits observational conditional independencies to suggest \"weak\" paths in a unknown causal graph. The widely used faithfulness condition of Spirtes et al. is relaxed to allow for varying degrees of \"path cancellations\" that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the existence of confounding causal paths. The outcome is a posterior distribution over bounds on the average causal effect via a linear programming approach and Bayesian inference. We claim this approach should be used in regular practice along with other default tools in observational studies."}
{"text": "Numbers and numerical vectors account for a large portion of data. However, recently the amount of string data generated has increased dramatically. Consequently, classifying string data is a common problem in many fields. The most widely used approach to this problem is to convert strings into numerical vectors using string kernels and subsequently apply a support vector machine that works in a numerical vector space. However, this non-one-to-one conversion involves a loss of information and makes it impossible to evaluate, using probability theory, the generalization error of a learning machine, considering that the given data to train and test the machine are strings generated according to probability laws. In this study, we approach this classification problem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings. To evaluate the generalization error of such a classifier theoretically, probability theory for strings is required. Therefore, we first extend a limit theorem on the asymptotic behavior of a consensus sequence of strings, which is the counterpart of the mean of numerical vectors, as demonstrated in the probability theory on a metric space of strings developed by one of the authors and his colleague in a previous study [18]. Using the obtained result, we then demonstrate that our learning machine classifies strings in an asymptotically optimal manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of our machine in practical data analysis by applying it to predicting protein--protein interactions using amino acid sequences."}
{"text": "Linear dimensionality reduction methods are a cornerstone of analyzing high dimensional data, due to their simple geometric interpretations and typically attractive computational properties. These methods capture many data features of interest, such as covariance, dynamical structure, correlation between data sets, input-output relationships, and margin between data classes. Methods have been developed with a variety of names and motivations in many fields, and perhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been highlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as optimization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component analysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlations analysis, maximum autocorrelation factors, slow feature analysis, sufficient dimensionality reduction, undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization framework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an orthogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis. More broadly, this survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology."}
{"text": "For a density $f$ on ${\\mathbb R}^d$, a {\\it high-density cluster} is any connected component of $\\{x: f(x) \\geq \\lambda\\}$, for some $\\lambda > 0$. The set of all high-density clusters forms a hierarchy called the {\\it cluster tree} of $f$. We present two procedures for estimating the cluster tree given samples from $f$. The first is a robust variant of the single linkage algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The second is based on the $k$-nearest neighbor graph of the samples. We give finite-sample convergence rates for these algorithms which also imply consistency, and we derive lower bounds on the sample complexity of cluster tree estimation. Finally, we study a tree pruning procedure that guarantees, under milder conditions than usual, to remove clusters that are spurious while recovering those that are salient."}
{"text": "Nonparametric regression for massive numbers of samples (n) and features (p) is an increasingly important problem. In big n settings, a common strategy is to partition the feature space, and then separately apply simple models to each partition set. We propose an alternative approach, which avoids such partitioning and the associated sensitivity to neighborhood choice and distance metrics, by using random compression combined with Gaussian process regression. The proposed approach is particularly motivated by the setting in which the response is conditionally independent of the features given the projection to a low dimensional manifold. Conditionally on the random compression matrix and a smoothness parameter, the posterior distribution for the regression surface and posterior predictive distributions are available analytically. Running the analysis in parallel for many random compression matrices and smoothness parameters, model averaging is used to combine the results. The algorithm can be implemented rapidly even in very big n and p problems, has strong theoretical justification, and is found to yield state of the art predictive performance."}
{"text": "This paper deals with the problem of nonparametric independence testing, a fundamental decision-theoretic problem that asks if two arbitrary (possibly multivariate) random variables $X,Y$ are independent or not, a question that comes up in many fields like causality and neuroscience. While quantities like correlation of $X,Y$ only test for (univariate) linear independence, natural alternatives like mutual information of $X,Y$ are hard to estimate due to a serious curse of dimensionality. A recent approach, avoiding both issues, estimates norms of an \\textit{operator} in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). Our main contribution is strong empirical evidence that by employing \\textit{shrunk} operators when the sample size is small, one can attain an improvement in power at low false positive rates. We analyze the effects of Stein shrinkage on a popular test statistic called HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion). Our observations provide insights into two recently proposed shrinkage estimators, SCOSE and FCOSE - we prove that SCOSE is (essentially) the optimal linear shrinkage method for \\textit{estimating} the true operator; however, the non-linearly shrunk FCOSE usually achieves greater improvements in \\textit{test power}. This work is important for more powerful nonparametric detection of subtle nonlinear dependencies for small samples."}
{"text": "We study the problem of low-rank tensor factorization in the presence of missing data. We ask the following question: how many sampled entries do we need, to efficiently and exactly reconstruct a tensor with a low-rank orthogonal decomposition? We propose a novel alternating minimization based method which iteratively refines estimates of the singular vectors. We show that under certain standard assumptions, our method can recover a three-mode $n\\times n\\times n$ dimensional rank-$r$ tensor exactly from $O(n^{3/2} r^5 \\log^4 n)$ randomly sampled entries. In the process of proving this result, we solve two challenging sub-problems for tensors with missing data. First, in the process of analyzing the initialization step, we prove a generalization of a celebrated result by Szemer\\'edie et al. on the spectrum of random graphs. Next, we prove global convergence of alternating minimization with a good initialization. Simulations suggest that the dependence of the sample size on dimensionality $n$ is indeed tight."}

{"text": "We analyze the generalization and robustness of the batched weighted average algorithm for V-geometrically ergodic Markov data. This algorithm is a good alternative to the empirical risk minimization algorithm when the latter suffers from overfitting or when optimizing the empirical risk is hard. For the generalization of the algorithm, we prove a PAC-style bound on the training sample size for the expected $L_1$-loss to converge to the optimal loss when training data are V-geometrically ergodic Markov chains. For the robustness, we show that if the training target variable's values contain bounded noise, then the generalization bound of the algorithm deviates at most by the range of the noise. Our results can be applied to the regression problem, the classification problem, and the case where there exists an unknown deterministic target hypothesis."}
{"text": "Subsampling methods have been recently proposed to speed up least squares estimation in large scale settings. However, these algorithms are typically not robust to outliers or corruptions in the observed covariates.   The concept of influence that was developed for regression diagnostics can be used to detect such corrupted observations as shown in this paper. This property of influence -- for which we also develop a randomized approximation -- motivates our proposed subsampling algorithm for large scale corrupted linear regression which limits the influence of data points since highly influential points contribute most to the residual error. Under a general model of corrupted observations, we show theoretically and empirically on a variety of simulated and real datasets that our algorithm improves over the current state-of-the-art approximation schemes for ordinary least squares."}
{"text": "We propose LOCO, an algorithm for large-scale ridge regression which distributes the features across workers on a cluster. Important dependencies between variables are preserved using structured random projections which are cheap to compute and must only be communicated once. We show that LOCO obtains a solution which is close to the exact ridge regression solution in the fixed design setting. We verify this experimentally in a simulation study as well as an application to climate prediction. Furthermore, we show that LOCO achieves significant speedups compared with a state-of-the-art distributed algorithm on a large-scale regression problem."}
{"text": "Despite the fact that they do not consider the temporal nature of data, classic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, are widely applied to time series data. In this paper, we introduce a factor decomposition specific for time series that builds upon the Bayesian multivariate autoregressive model and hence evades the assumption that data points are mutually independent. The key is to find a low-rank estimation of the autoregressive matrices. As in the probabilistic version of other factor models, this induces a latent low-dimensional representation of the original data. We discuss some possible generalisations and alternatives, with the most relevant being a technique for simultaneous smoothing and dimensionality reduction. To illustrate the potential applications, we apply the model on a synthetic data set and different types of neuroimaging data (EEG and ECoG)."}
{"text": "Crowdsourcing is a popular paradigm for effectively collecting labels at low cost. The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers. However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other recently proposed methods."}
{"text": "We present a technique for significantly speeding up Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Gradient Descent (GD), two widely used algorithms for tensor factorization. By exploiting properties of the Khatri-Rao product, we show how to efficiently address a computationally challenging sub-step of both algorithms. Our algorithm, DFacTo, only requires two sparse matrix-vector products and is easy to parallelize. DFacTo is not only scalable but also on average 4 to 10 times faster than competing algorithms on a variety of datasets. For instance, DFacTo only takes 480 seconds on 4 machines to perform one iteration of the ALS algorithm and 1,143 seconds to perform one iteration of the GD algorithm on a 6.5 million x 2.5 million x 1.5 million dimensional tensor with 1.2 billion non-zero entries."}
{"text": "We consider statistical as well as algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. For a LS problem with input data $(X, Y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$, sketching algorithms use a sketching matrix, $S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$ with $r \\ll n$. Then, rather than solving the LS problem using the full data $(X,Y)$, sketching algorithms solve the LS problem using only the sketched data $(SX, SY)$. Prior work has typically adopted an algorithmic perspective, in that it has made no statistical assumptions on the input $X$ and $Y$, and instead it has been assumed that the data $(X,Y)$ are fixed and worst-case (WC). Prior results show that, when using sketching matrices such as random projections and leverage-score sampling algorithms, with $p < r \\ll n$, the WC error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a small constant. From a statistical perspective, we typically consider the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data $(X, Y)$ are generated according to a statistical model $Y = X \\beta + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a noise process. We provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling sketching algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $p < r \\ll n$ while the PE typically requires the sample size $r$ to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent results show that our upper bounds on PE can not be improved."}
{"text": "We consider a problem of grouping multiple graphs into several clusters using singular value thesholding and non-negative factorization. We derive a model selection information criterion to estimate the number of clusters.

{"text": "A natural approach to analyze interaction data of form \"what-connects-to-what-when\" is to create a time-series (or rather a sequence) of graphs through temporal discretization (bandwidth selection) and spatial discretization (vertex contraction). Such discretization together with non-negative factorization techniques can be useful for obtaining clustering of graphs. Motivating application of performing clustering of graphs (as opposed to vertex clustering) can be found in neuroscience and in social network analysis, and it can also be used to enhance community detection (i.e., vertex clustering) by way of conditioning on the cluster labels. In this paper, we formulate a problem of clustering of graphs as a model selection problem. Our approach involves information criteria, non-negative matrix factorization and singular value thresholding, and we illustrate our techniques using real and simulated data."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the mode-seeking framework. Given a dataset in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, we define regions of high density that we call cluster cores. We then consider a random walk on a neighborhood graph built on top of our data points which is designed to be attracted by high density regions. The strength of this attraction is controlled by a temperature parameter $\\beta > 0$. The membership of a point to a given cluster is then the probability for the random walk to hit the corresponding cluster core before any other. While many properties of random walks (such as hitting times, commute distances, etc\\dots) have been shown to enventually encode purely local information when the number of data points grows, we show that the regularization introduced by the use of cluster cores solves this issue. Empirically, we show how the choice of $\\beta$ influences the behavior of our algorithm: for small values of $\\beta$ the result is close to hard mode-seeking whereas when $\\beta$ is close to $1$ the result is similar to the output of a (fuzzy) spectral clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by providing the fuzzy clustering of a protein configuration dataset containing a million data points in $30$ dimensions."}
{"text": "We consider the class of optimization problems arising from computationally intensive L1-regularized M-estimators, where the function or gradient values are very expensive to compute. A particular instance of interest is the L1-regularized MLE for learning Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which are a popular class of statistical models for varied structured prediction problems such as sequence labeling, alignment, and classification with label taxonomy. L1-regularized MLEs for CRFs are particularly expensive to optimize since computing the gradient values requires an expensive inference step. In this work, we propose the use of a carefully constructed proximal quasi-Newton algorithm for such computationally intensive M-estimation problems, where we employ an aggressive active set selection technique. In a key contribution of the paper, we show that the proximal quasi-Newton method is provably super-linearly convergent, even in the absence of strong convexity, by leveraging a restricted variant of strong convexity. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm converges considerably faster than current state-of-the-art on the problems of sequence labeling and hierarchical classification."}
{"text": "Estimation of density derivatives is a versatile tool in statistical data analysis. A naive approach is to first estimate the density and then compute its derivative. However, such a two-step approach does not work well because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density-derivative estimator. In this paper, we give a direct method to approximate the density derivative without estimating the density itself. Our proposed estimator allows analytic and computationally efficient approximation of multi-dimensional high-order density derivatives, with the ability that all hyper-parameters can be chosen objectively by cross-validation. We further show that the proposed density-derivative estimator is useful in improving the accuracy of non-parametric KL-divergence estimation via metric learning. The practical superiority of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated in change detection and feature selection."}
{"text": "We study the problem of learning sparse structure changes between two Markov networks $P$ and $Q$. Rather than fitting two Markov networks separately to two sets of data and figuring out their differences, a recent work proposed to learn changes \\emph{directly} via estimating the ratio between two Markov network models. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for \\emph{successful change detection} with respect to the sample size $n_p, n_q$, the dimension of data $m$, and the number of changed edges $d$. When using an unbounded density ratio model we prove that the true sparse changes can be consistently identified for $n_p = \\Omega(d^2 \\log \\frac{m^2+m}{2})$ and $n_q = \\Omega({n_p^2})$, with an exponentially decaying upper-bound on learning error. Such sample complexity can be improved to $\\min(n_p, n_q) = \\Omega(d^2 \\log \\frac{m^2+m}{2})$ when the boundedness of the density ratio model is assumed. Our theoretical guarantee can be applied to a wide range of discrete/continuous Markov networks."}
{"text": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a widely used statistical tool with both well established theory and favorable performance for a wide range of machine learning problems. However, computing CCA for huge datasets can be very slow since it involves implementing QR decomposition or singular value decomposition of huge matrices. In this paper we introduce L-CCA, a iterative algorithm which can compute CCA fast on huge sparse datasets. Theory on both the asymptotic convergence and finite time accuracy of L-CCA are established. The experiments also show that L-CCA outperform other fast CCA approximation schemes on two real datasets."}
{"text": "The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases. Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (l2 penalty) or scattered (l1 penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of l1, l2, and TV penalties while preserving the exact l1 penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions."}
{"text": "Many graph clustering quality functions suffer from a resolution limit, the inability to find small clusters in large graphs. So called resolution-limit-free quality functions do not have this limit. This property was previously introduced for hard clustering, that is, graph partitioning.   We investigate the resolution-limit-free property in the context of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for hard and soft graph clustering. To use NMF in the hard clustering setting, a common approach is to assign each node to its highest membership cluster. We show that in this case symmetric NMF is not resolution-limit-free, but that it becomes so when hardness constraints are used as part of the optimization. The resulting function is strongly linked to the Constant Potts Model. In soft clustering, nodes can belong to more than one cluster, with varying degrees of membership. In this setting resolution-limit-free turns out to be too strong a property. Therefore we introduce locality, which roughly states that changing one part of the graph does not affect the clustering of other parts of the graph. We argue that this is a desirable property, provide conditions under which NMF quality functions are local, and propose a novel class of local probabilistic NMF quality functions for soft graph clustering."}
{"text": "This paper presents a Bayesian generative model for dependent Cox point processes, alongside an efficient inference scheme which scales as if the point processes were modelled independently. We can handle missing data naturally, infer latent structure, and cope with large numbers of observed processes. A further novel contribution enables the model to work effectively in higher dimensional spaces. Using this method, we achieve vastly improved predictive performance on both 2D and 1D real data, validating our structured approach."}
{"text": "Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results.   Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn.   In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions.

{"text": "Matrix factorization (MF) has become a common approach to collaborative filtering, due to ease of implementation and scalability to large data sets. Two existing drawbacks of the basic model is that it does not incorporate side information on either users or items, and assumes a common variance for all users. We extend the work of constrained probabilistic matrix factorization by deriving the Gibbs updates for the side feature vectors for items (Salakhutdinov and Minh, 2008). We show that this Bayesian treatment to the constrained PMF model outperforms simple MAP estimation. We also consider extensions to heteroskedastic precision introduced in the literature (Lakshminarayanan, Bouchard, and Archambeau, 2011). We show that this tends result in overfitting for deterministic approximation algorithms (ex: Variational inference) when the observed entries in the user / item matrix are distributed in an non-uniform manner. In light of this, we propose a truncated precision model. Our experimental results suggest that this model tends to delay overfitting."}
{"text": "We introduce a means of automating machine learning (ML) for big data tasks, by performing scalable stochastic Bayesian optimisation of ML algorithm parameters and hyper-parameters. More often than not, the critical tuning of ML algorithm parameters has relied on domain expertise from experts, along with laborious hand-tuning, brute search or lengthy sampling runs. Against this background, Bayesian optimisation is finding increasing use in automating parameter tuning, making ML algorithms accessible even to non-experts. However, the state of the art in Bayesian optimisation is incapable of scaling to the large number of evaluations of algorithm performance required to fit realistic models to complex, big data. We here describe a stochastic, sparse, Bayesian optimisation strategy to solve this problem, using many thousands of noisy evaluations of algorithm performance on subsets of data in order to effectively train algorithms for big data. We provide a comprehensive benchmarking of possible sparsification strategies for Bayesian optimisation, concluding that a Nystrom approximation offers the best scaling and performance for real tasks. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement over the state of the art in tuning the parameters of a Gaussian Process time series prediction task on real, big data."}
{"text": "This contribution deals with the generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm in the domain of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The generalized symmetric version of FastICA has been shown to have the potential to achieve the Cram\\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) by allowing the usage of different nonlinearity functions in its parallel implementations of one-unit FastICA. In spite of this appealing property, a rigorous study of the asymptotic error of the generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm is still missing in the community. In fact, all the existing results exhibit certain limitations, such as ignoring the impact of data standardization on the asymptotic statistics or being based on a heuristic approach.   In this work, we aim at filling this blank.   The first result of this contribution is the characterization of the limits of the generalized symmetric FastICA. It is shown that the algorithm optimizes a function that is a sum of the contrast functions used by traditional one-unit FastICA with a correction of the sign. Based on this characterization, we derive a closed-form analytic expression of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the generalized symmetric FastICA estimator using the method of estimating equation and M-estimator."}
{"text": "A large amount of observational data has been accumulated in various fields in recent times, and there is a growing need to estimate the generating processes of these data. A linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) based on the non-Gaussianity of external influences has been proposed to estimate the data-generating processes of variables. However, the results of the estimation can be biased if there are latent classes. In this paper, we first review LiNGAM, its extended model, as well as the estimation procedure for LiNGAM in a Bayesian framework. We then propose a new Bayesian estimation procedure that solves the problem."}
{"text": "Recently, there has been focus on penalized log-likelihood covariance estimation for sparse inverse covariance (precision) matrices. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity, and a very common choice is the convex $l_1$ norm. However, the best estimator performance is not always achieved with this penalty. The most natural sparsity promoting \"norm\" is the non-convex $l_0$ penalty but its lack of convexity has deterred its use in sparse maximum likelihood estimation. In this paper we consider non-convex $l_0$ penalized log-likelihood inverse covariance estimation and present a novel cyclic descent algorithm for its optimization. Convergence to a local minimizer is proved, which is highly non-trivial, and we demonstrate via simulations the reduced bias and superior quality of the $l_0$ penalty as compared to the $l_1$ penalty."}
{"text": "This paper generalizes an important result from the PAC-Bayesian literature for binary classification to the case of ensemble methods for structured outputs. We prove a generic version of the \\Cbound, an upper bound over the risk of models expressed as a weighted majority vote that is based on the first and second statistical moments of the vote's margin. This bound may advantageously $(i)$ be applied on more complex outputs such as multiclass labels and multilabel, and $(ii)$ allow to consider margin relaxations. These results open the way to develop new ensemble methods for structured output prediction with PAC-Bayesian guarantees."}
{"text": "We prove new fast learning rates for the one-vs-all multiclass plug-in classifiers trained either from exponentially strongly mixing data or from data generated by a converging drifting distribution. These are two typical scenarios where training data are not iid. The learning rates are obtained under a multiclass version of Tsybakov's margin assumption, a type of low-noise assumption, and do not depend on the number of classes. Our results are general and include a previous result for binary-class plug-in classifiers with iid data as a special case. In contrast to previous works for least squares SVMs under the binary-class setting, our results retain the optimal learning rate in the iid case."}
{"text": "We define the beta diffusion tree, a random tree structure with a set of leaves that defines a collection of overlapping subsets of objects, known as a feature allocation. A generative process for the tree structure is defined in terms of particles (representing the objects) diffusing in some continuous space, analogously to the Dirichlet diffusion tree (Neal, 2003), which defines a tree structure over partitions (i.e., non-overlapping subsets) of the objects. Unlike in the Dirichlet diffusion tree, multiple copies of a particle may exist and diffuse along multiple branches in the beta diffusion tree, and an object may therefore belong to multiple subsets of particles. We demonstrate how to build a hierarchically-clustered factor analysis model with the beta diffusion tree and how to perform inference over the random tree structures with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conclude with several numerical experiments on missing data problems with data sets of gene expression microarrays, international development statistics, and intranational socioeconomic measurements."}
{"text": "A large number of algorithms in machine learning, from principal component analysis (PCA), and its non-linear (kernel) extensions, to more recent spectral embedding and support estimation methods, rely on estimating a linear subspace from samples. In this paper we introduce a general formulation of this problem and derive novel learning error estimates. Our results rely on natural assumptions on the spectral properties of the covariance operator associated to the data distribu- tion, and hold for a wide class of metrics between subspaces. As special cases, we discuss sharp error estimates for the reconstruction properties of PCA and spectral support estimation. Key to our analysis is an operator theoretic approach that has broad applicability to spectral learning methods."}
{"text": "A wild bootstrap method for nonparametric hypothesis tests based on kernel distribution embeddings is proposed. This bootstrap method is used to construct provably consistent tests that apply to random processes, for which the naive permutation-based bootstrap fails. It applies to a large group of kernel tests based on V-statistics, which are degenerate under the null hypothesis, and non-degenerate elsewhere. To illustrate this approach, we construct a two-sample test, an instantaneous independence test and a multiple lag independence test for time series. In experiments, the wild bootstrap gives strong performance on synthetic examples, on audio data, and in performance benchmarking for the Gibbs sampler."}
{"text": "This paper introduces Kernel-based Information Criterion (KIC) for model selection in regression analysis. The novel kernel-based complexity measure in KIC efficiently computes the interdependency between parameters of the model using a variable-wise variance and yields selection of better, more robust regressors. Experimental results show superior performance on both simulated and real data sets compared to Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), kernel-based Information Complexity (ICOMP), and maximum log of marginal likelihood in Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)."}
{"text": "The FastICA algorithm is one of the most popular iterative algorithms in the domain of linear independent component analysis. Despite its success, it is observed that FastICA occasionally yields outcomes that do not correspond to any true solutions (known as demixing vectors) of the ICA problem. These outcomes are commonly referred to as spurious solutions. Although FastICA is among the most extensively studied ICA algorithms, the occurrence of spurious solutions are not yet completely understood by the community. In this contribution, we aim at addressing this issue. In the first part of this work, we are interested in the relationship between demixing vectors, local optimizers of the contrast function and (attractive or unattractive) fixed points of FastICA algorithm. Characterizations of these sets are given, and an inclusion relationship is discovered. In the second part, we investigate the possible scenarios where spurious solutions occur. We show that when certain bimodal Gaussian mixtures distributions are involved, there may exist spurious solutions that are attractive fixed points of FastICA. In this case, popular nonlinearities such as \"gauss\" or \"tanh\" tend to yield spurious solutions, whereas only \"kurtosis\" may give reliable results. Some advices are given for the practical choice of nonlinearity function."}
{"text": "Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally expensive. Both the calculation of the acceptance probability and the creation of informed proposals usually require an iteration through the whole data set. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem by generating proposals which are only based on a subset of the data, by skipping the accept-reject step and by using decreasing step-sizes sequence $(\\delta_m)_{m \\geq 0}$.   %Under appropriate Lyapunov conditions, We provide in this article a rigorous mathematical framework for analysing this algorithm. We prove that, under verifiable assumptions, the algorithm is consistent, satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) and its asymptotic bias-variance decomposition can be characterized by an explicit functional of the step-sizes sequence $(\\delta_m)_{m \\geq 0}$. We leverage this analysis to give practical recommendations for the notoriously difficult tuning of this algorithm: it is asymptotically optimal to use a step-size sequence of the type $\\delta_m \\asymp m^{-1/3}$, leading to an algorithm whose mean squared error (MSE) decreases at rate $\\mathcal{O}(m^{-1/3})$"}
{"text": "Log-linear models are the popular workhorses of analyzing contingency tables. A log-linear parameterization of an interaction model can be more expressive than a direct parameterization based on probabilities, leading to a powerful way of defining restrictions derived from marginal, conditional and context-specific independence. However, parameter estimation is often simpler under a direct parameterization, provided that the model enjoys certain decomposability properties. Here we introduce a cyclical projection algorithm for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of log-linear parameters under an arbitrary context-specific graphical log-linear model, which needs not satisfy criteria of decomposability. We illustrate that lifting the restriction of decomposability makes the models more expressive, such that additional context-specific independencies embedded in real data can be identified. It is also shown how a context-specific graphical model can correspond to a non-hierarchical log-linear parameterization with a concise interpretation. This observation can pave way to further development of non-hierarchical log-linear models, which have been largely neglected due to their believed lack of interpretability."}

Observed pairs are assumed to be generated by a simple popularity based selection process followed by censoring using a preference function. By basing inference on the well-founded principle of variational bounding, and using new site-independent bounds, we show how a scalable inference procedure can be obtained for large data sets. State of the art results are presented on real-world movie viewing data."}
{"text": "This paper studies ordered weighted L1 (OWL) norm regularization for sparse estimation problems with strongly correlated variables. We prove sufficient conditions for clustering based on the correlation/colinearity of variables using the OWL norm, of which the so-called OSCAR is a particular case. Our results extend previous ones for OSCAR in several ways: for the squared error loss, our conditions hold for the more general OWL norm and under weaker assumptions; we also establish clustering conditions for the absolute error loss, which is, as far as we know, a novel result. Furthermore, we characterize the statistical performance of OWL norm regularization for generative models in which certain clusters of regression variables are strongly (even perfectly) correlated, but variables in different clusters are uncorrelated. We show that if the true p-dimensional signal generating the data involves only s of the clusters, then O(s log p) samples suffice to accurately estimate the signal, regardless of the number of coefficients within the clusters. The estimation of s-sparse signals with completely independent variables requires just as many measurements. In other words, using the OWL we pay no price (in terms of the number of measurements) for the presence of strongly correlated variables."}
{"text": "In practical Bayesian optimization, we must often search over structures with differing numbers of parameters. For instance, we may wish to search over neural network architectures with an unknown number of layers. To relate performance data gathered for different architectures, we define a new kernel for conditional parameter spaces that explicitly includes information about which parameters are relevant in a given structure. We show that this kernel improves model quality and Bayesian optimization results over several simpler baseline kernels."}
{"text": "Network metrics form a fundamental part of the network analysis toolbox. Used to quantitatively measure different aspects of the network, these metrics can give insights into the underlying network structure and function. In this work, we connect network metrics to modern probabilistic machine learning. We focus on the centrality metric, which is used a wide variety of applications from web search to gene-analysis. First, we formulate an eigenvector-based Bayesian centrality model for determining node importance. Compared to existing methods, our probabilistic model allows for the assimilation of multiple edge weight observations, the inclusion of priors and the extraction of uncertainties. To enable tractable inference, we develop a variational lower bound (VBC) that is demonstrated to be effective on a variety of networks (two synthetic and five real-world graphs). We then bridge this model to sparse Gaussian processes. The sparse variational Bayesian centrality Gaussian process (VBC-GP) learns a mapping between node attributes to latent centrality and hence, is capable of predicting centralities from node features and can potentially represent a large number of nodes using only a limited number of inducing inputs. Experiments show that the VBC-GP learns high-quality mappings and compares favorably to a two-step baseline, i.e., a full GP trained on the node attributes and pre-computed centralities. Finally, we present two case-studies using the VBC-GP: first, to ascertain relevant features in a taxi transport network and second, to distribute a limited number of vaccines to mitigate the severity of a viral outbreak."}
{"text": "We are interested in learning causal relationships between pairs of random variables, purely from observational data. To effectively address this task, the state-of-the-art relies on strong assumptions regarding the mechanisms mapping causes to effects, such as invertibility or the existence of additive noise, which only hold in limited situations. On the contrary, this short paper proposes to learn how to perform causal inference directly from data, and without the need of feature engineering. In particular, we pose causality as a kernel mean embedding classification problem, where inputs are samples from arbitrary probability distributions on pairs of random variables, and labels are types of causal relationships. We validate the performance of our method on synthetic and real-world data against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we submitted our algorithm to the ChaLearn's \"Fast Causation Coefficient Challenge\" competition, with which we won the fastest code prize and ranked third in the overall leaderboard."}
{"text": "We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for a type of asymmetry between causes and effects that is present when these are related via linear models contaminated with additive non-Gaussian noise. Assuming that the causes and the effects have the same distribution, we show that the distribution of the residuals of a linear fit in the anti-causal direction is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of the residuals in the causal direction. This Gaussianization effect is characterized by reduction of the magnitude of the high-order cumulants and by an increment of the differential entropy of the residuals. The problem of non-linear causal inference is addressed by performing an embedding in an expanded feature space, in which the relation between causes and effects can be assumed to be linear. The effectiveness of a method to discriminate between causes and effects based on this type of asymmetry is illustrated in a variety of experiments using different measures of Gaussianity. The proposed method is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art techniques for causal inference."}
{"text": "Variational inference is a powerful concept that underlies many iterative approximation algorithms; expectation propagation, mean-field methods and belief propagations were all central themes at the school that can be perceived from this unifying framework. The lectures of Manfred Opper introduce the archetypal example of Expectation Propagation, before establishing the connection with the other approximation methods. Corrections by expansion about the expectation propagation are then explained. Finally some advanced inference topics and applications are explored in the final sections."}
{"text": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography are the only methods to measure the structure of the white matter in the living human brain. The diffusion signal has been modelled as the combined contribution from many individual fascicles of nerve fibers passing through each location in the white matter. Typically, this is done via basis pursuit, but estimation of the exact directions is limited due to discretization. The difficulties inherent in modeling DWI data are shared by many other problems involving fitting non-parametric mixture models. Ekanadaham et al. proposed an approach, continuous basis pursuit, to overcome discretization error in the 1-dimensional case (e.g., spike-sorting). Here, we propose a more general algorithm that fits mixture models of any dimensionality without discretization. Our algorithm uses the principles of L2-boost, together with refitting of the weights and pruning of the parameters. The addition of these steps to L2-boost both accelerates the algorithm and assures its accuracy. We refer to the resulting algorithm as elastic basis pursuit, or EBP, since it expands and contracts the active set of kernels as needed. We show that in contrast to existing approaches to fitting mixtures, our boosting framework (1) enables the selection of the optimal bias-variance tradeoff along the solution path, and (2) scales with high-dimensional problems. In simulations of DWI, we find that EBP yields better parameter estimates than a non-negative least squares (NNLS) approach, or the standard model used in DWI, the tensor model, which serves as the basis for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We demonstrate the utility of the method in DWI data acquired in parts of the brain containing crossings of multiple fascicles of nerve fibers."}
{"text": "Significant attention has been given to minimizing a penalized least squares criterion for estimating sparse solutions to large linear systems of equations. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity and the natural choice is the so-called $l_0$ norm. In this paper we develop a Momentumized Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding (MIST) algorithm for minimizing the resulting non-convex criterion and prove its convergence to a local minimizer. Simulations on large data sets show superior performance of the proposed method to other methods."}
{"text": "Principal Components Analysis is a widely used technique for dimension reduction and characterization of variability in multivariate populations. Our interest lies in studying when and why the rotation to principal components can be used effectively within a response-predictor set relationship in the context of mode hunting.

Using basic geometrical arguments, we then demonstrate how the PC rotation of the predictor space alone can in fact generate improved mode estimators. Simulation results are used to illustrate our findings."}
{"text": "This paper introduces a linear state-space model with time-varying dynamics. The time dependency is obtained by forming the state dynamics matrix as a time-varying linear combination of a set of matrices. The time dependency of the weights in the linear combination is modelled by another linear Gaussian dynamical model allowing the model to learn how the dynamics of the process changes. Previous approaches have used switching models which have a small set of possible state dynamics matrices and the model selects one of those matrices at each time, thus jumping between them. Our model forms the dynamics as a linear combination and the changes can be smooth and more continuous. The model is motivated by physical processes which are described by linear partial differential equations whose parameters vary in time. An example of such a process could be a temperature field whose evolution is driven by a varying wind direction. The posterior inference is performed using variational Bayesian approximation. The experiments on stochastic advection-diffusion processes and real-world weather processes show that the model with time-varying dynamics can outperform previously introduced approaches."}
{"text": "In recent years rank aggregation has received significant attention from the machine learning community. The goal of such a problem is to combine the (partially revealed) preferences over objects of a large population into a single, relatively consistent ordering of those objects. However, in many cases, we might not want a single ranking and instead opt for individual rankings. We study a version of the problem known as collaborative ranking. In this problem we assume that individual users provide us with pairwise preferences (for example purchasing one item over another). From those preferences we wish to obtain rankings on items that the users have not had an opportunity to explore. The results here have a very interesting connection to the standard matrix completion problem. We provide a theoretical justification for a nuclear norm regularized optimization procedure, and provide high-dimensional scaling results that show how the error in estimating user preferences behaves as the number of observations increase."}
{"text": "We propose a novel graphical model selection (GMS) scheme for high-dimensional stationary time series or discrete time process. The method is based on a natural generalization of the graphical LASSO (gLASSO), introduced originally for GMS based on i.i.d. samples, and estimates the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a time series from a finite length observation. The gLASSO for time series is defined as the solution of an l1-regularized maximum (approximate) likelihood problem. We solve this optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our approach is nonparametric as we do not assume a finite dimensional (e.g., an autoregressive) parametric model for the observed process. Instead, we require the process to be sufficiently smooth in the spectral domain. For Gaussian processes, we characterize the performance of our method theoretically by deriving an upper bound on the probability that our algorithm fails to correctly identify the CIG. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the correct CIG from a limited amount of samples."}
{"text": "Distributed learning of probabilistic models from multiple data repositories with minimum communication is increasingly important. We study a simple communication-efficient learning framework that first calculates the local maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based on the data subsets, and then combines the local MLEs to achieve the best possible approximation to the global MLE given the whole dataset. We study this framework's statistical properties, showing that the efficiency loss compared to the global setting relates to how much the underlying distribution families deviate from full exponential families, drawing connection to the theory of information loss by Fisher, Rao and Efron. We show that the \"full-exponential-family-ness\" represents the lower bound of the error rate of arbitrary combinations of local MLEs, and is achieved by a KL-divergence-based combination method but not by a more common linear combination method. We also study the empirical properties of both methods, showing that the KL method significantly outperforms linear combination in practical settings with issues such as model misspecification, non-convexity, and heterogeneous data partitions."}
{"text": "We study prediction and estimation problems using empirical risk minimization, relative to a general convex loss function. We obtain sharp error rates even when concentration is false or is very restricted, for example, in heavy-tailed scenarios. Our results show that the error rate depends on two parameters: one captures the intrinsic complexity of the class, and essentially leads to the error rate in a noise-free (or realizable) problem; the other measures interactions between class members the target and the loss, and is dominant when the problem is far from realizable. We also explain how one may deal with outliers by choosing the loss in a way that is calibrated to the intrinsic complexity of the class and to the noise-level of the problem (the latter is measured by the distance between the target and the class)."}
{"text": "We consider the task of fitting a regression model involving interactions among a potentially large set of covariates, in which we wish to enforce strong heredity. We propose FAMILY, a very general framework for this task. Our proposal is a generalization of several existing methods, such as VANISH [Radchenko and James, 2010], hierNet [Bien et al., 2013], the all-pairs lasso, and the lasso using only main effects. It can be formulated as the solution to a convex optimization problem, which we solve using an efficient alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This algorithm has guaranteed convergence to the global optimum, can be easily specialized to any convex penalty function of interest, and allows for a straightforward extension to the setting of generalized linear models. We derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom of FAMILY, and explore its performance in a simulation study and on an HIV sequence data set."}
{"text": "The classical approach to inverse problems is based on the optimization of a misfit function. Despite its computational appeal, such an approach suffers from many shortcomings, e.g., non-uniqueness of solutions, modeling prior knowledge, etc. The Bayesian formalism to inverse problems avoids most of the difficulties encountered by the optimization approach, albeit at an increased computational cost. In this work, we use information theoretic arguments to cast the Bayesian inference problem in terms of an optimization problem. The resulting scheme combines the theoretical soundness of fully Bayesian inference with the computational efficiency of a simple optimization."}
{"text": "We are focusing on bound constrained global optimization problems, whose objective functions are computationally expensive black-box functions and have multiple local minima. The recently popular Metric Stochastic Response Surface (MSRS) algorithm proposed by \\cite{Regis2007SRBF} based on adaptive or sequential learning based on response surfaces is revisited and further extended for better performance in case of higher dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a new way to generate the candidate points which the next function evaluation point is picked from according to the metric criteria, based on a new definition of distance, and prove the global convergence of the corresponding. Correspondingly, a more adaptive implementation of MSRS, named \"SO-SA\", is presented. \"SO-SA\" is is more likely to perturb those most sensitive coordinates when generating the candidate points, instead of perturbing all coordinates simultaneously.   Numerical experiments on both synthetic problems and real problems demonstrate the advantages of our new algorithm, compared with many state of the art alternatives.}"}
{"text": "We introduce the Locally Linear Latent Variable Model (LL-LVM), a probabilistic model for non-linear manifold discovery that describes a joint distribution over observations, their manifold coordinates and locally linear maps conditioned on a set of neighbourhood relationships. The model allows straightforward variational optimisation of the posterior distribution on coordinates and locally linear maps from the latent space to the observation space given the data. Thus, the LL-LVM encapsulates the local-geometry preserving intuitions that underlie non-probabilistic methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE). Its probabilistic semantics make it easy to evaluate the quality of hypothesised neighbourhood relationships, select the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold, construct out-of-sample extensions and to combine the manifold model with additional probabilistic models that capture the structure of coordinates within the manifold."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose the first non-parametric Bayesian model using Gaussian Processes to make inference on Poisson Point Processes without resorting to gridding the domain or to introducing latent thinning points. Unlike competing models that scale cubically and have a squared memory requirement in the number of data points, our model has a linear complexity and memory requirement. We propose an MCMC sampler and show that our model is faster, more accurate and generates less correlated samples than competing models on both synthetic and real-life data. Finally, we show that our model easily handles data sizes not considered thus far by alternate approaches."}
{"text": "$L_1$ regularized logistic regression has now become a workhorse of data mining and bioinformatics: it is widely used for many classification problems, particularly ones with many features. However, $L_1$ regularization typically selects too many features and that so-called false positives are unavoidable. In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze an aggregation method for sparse logistic regression in high dimensions. This approach linearly combines the estimators from a suitable set of logistic models with different underlying sparsity patterns and can balance the predictive ability and model interpretability. Numerical performance of our proposed aggregation method is then investigated using simulation studies. We also analyze a published genome-wide case-control dataset to further evaluate the usefulness of the aggregation method in multilocus association mapping."}
{"text": "Portable, Wearable and Wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) Systems have the potential to be used as point-of-care for cardiovascular disease diagnostic systems. Such wearable and wireless ECG systems require automatic detection of cardiovascular disease. Even in the primary care, automation of ECG diagnostic systems will improve efficiency of ECG diagnosis and reduce the minimal training requirement of local healthcare workers. However, few fully automatic myocardial infarction (MI) disease detection algorithms have well been developed. This paper presents a novel automatic MI classification algorithm using second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with time varying coefficients, which simultaneously captures morphological and dynamic feature of highly correlated ECG signals. By effectively estimating the unobserved state variables and the parameters of the second order ODE, the accuracy of the classification was significantly improved. The estimated time varying coefficients of the second order ODE were used as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) for the MI classification. The proposed method was applied to the PTB diagnostic ECG database within Physionet. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy of 12 lead ECGs for MI binary classifications were 98.7%, 96.4% and 98.3%, respectively. We also found that even using one lead ECG signals, we can reach accuracy as high as 97%. Multiclass MI classification is a challenging task but the developed ODE approach for 12 lead ECGs coupled with multiclass SVM reached 96.4% accuracy for classifying 5 subgroups of MI and healthy controls."}
{"text": "Realizations of stochastic process are often observed temporal data or functional data. There are growing interests in classification of dynamic or functional data. The basic feature of functional data is that the functional data have infinite dimensions and are highly correlated. An essential issue for classifying dynamic and functional data is how to effectively reduce their dimension and explore dynamic feature. However, few statistical methods for dynamic data classification have directly used rich dynamic features of the data. We propose to use second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) to model dynamic process and principal differential analysis to estimate constant or time-varying parameters in the ODE. We examine differential dynamic properties of the dynamic system across different conditions including stability and transient-response, which determine how the dynamic systems maintain their functions and performance under a broad range of random internal and external perturbations. We use the parameters in the ODE as features for classifiers. As a proof of principle, the proposed methods are applied to classifying normal and abnormal QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) data analysis, which is of great clinical values in diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. We show that the ODE-based classification methods in QRS complex classification outperform the currently widely used neural networks with Fourier expansion coefficients of the functional data as their features. We expect that the dynamic model-based classification methods may open a new avenue for functional data classification."}
{"text": "In this paper, we focus on developing efficient sensitivity analysis methods for a computationally expensive objective function $f(x)$ in the case that the minimization of it has just been performed. Here \"computationally expensive\" means that each of its evaluation takes significant amount of time, and therefore our main goal to use a small number of function evaluations of $f(x)$ to further infer the sensitivity information of these different parameters. Correspondingly, we consider the optimization procedure as an adaptive experimental design and re-use its available function evaluations as the initial design points to establish a surrogate model $s(x)$ (or called response surface). The sensitivity analysis is performed on $s(x)$, which is an lieu of $f(x)$. Furthermore, we propose a new local multivariate sensitivity measure, for example, around the optimal solution, for high dimensional problems. Then a corresponding \"objective-oriented experimental design\" is proposed in order to make the generated surrogate $s(x)$ better suitable for the accurate calculation of the proposed specific local sensitivity quantities. In addition, we demonstrate the better performance of the Gaussian radial basis function interpolator over Kriging in our cases, which are of relatively high dimensionality and few experimental design points. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the optimization procedure and the \"objective-oriented experimental design\" behavior much better than the classical Latin Hypercube Design. In addition, the performance of Kriging is not as good as Gaussian RBF, especially in the case of high dimensional problems."}
{"text": "In high-dimensional data, structured noise caused by observed and unobserved factors affecting multiple target variables simultaneously, imposes a serious challenge for modeling, by masking the often weak signal. Therefore, (1) explaining away the structured noise in multiple-output regression is of paramount importance. Additionally, (2) assumptions about the correlation structure of the regression weights are needed. We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the \\emph{latent signal-to-noise ratio} which turns out to be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite-dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational unidentifiability in reduced-rank regression models. Simulations and prediction experiments with metabolite, gene expression, FMRI measurement, and macroeconomic time series data show that our model equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance and, in particular, outperforms the standard approach of assuming independent noise and signal models."}
{"text": "Advances of modern sensing and sequencing technologies generate a deluge of high dimensional space-temporal physiological and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Physiological traits are observed either as continuous random functions, or on a dense grid and referred to as function-valued traits. Both physiological and NGS data are highly correlated data with their inherent order, spacing, and functional nature which are ignored by traditional summary-based univariate and multivariate regression methods designed for quantitative genetic analysis of scalar trait and common variants. To capture morphological and dynamic features of the data and utilize their dependent structure, we propose a functional linear model (FLM) in which a trait curve is modeled as a response function, the genetic variation in a genomic region or gene is modeled as a functional predictor, and the genetic effects are modeled as a function of both time and genomic position (FLMF) for genetic analysis of function-valued trait with both GWAS and NGS data. By extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the FLMF has the correct type 1 error rates and much higher power to detect association than the existing methods. The FLMF is applied to sleep data from Starr County health studies where oxygen saturation were measured in 22,670 seconds on average for 833 individuals. We found 65 genes that were significantly associated with oxygen saturation functional trait with P-values ranging from 2.40E-06 to 2.53E-21. The results clearly demonstrate that the FLMF substantially outperforms the traditional genetic models with scalar trait."}
{"text": "Motivated by large-scale Collaborative-Filtering applications, we present a Non-Commuting Latent Factor (NCLF) tensor-completion approach for modeling three-way arrays, which is diagonal like the standard PARAFAC, but wherein different terms distinguish different kinds of three-way relations of co-clusters, as determined by permutations of latent factors. The first key component of the algebraic representation is the usage of two non-commutative real trilinear operations as the building blocks of the approximation. These operations are the standard three dimensional triple-product and a trilinear product on a two-dimensional real vector space, which is a representation of the real Clifford Algebra Cl(1,1) (a certain Majorana spinor). Both operations are purely ternary in that they cannot be decomposed into two group-operations on the relevant spaces. The second key component of the method is combining these operations using permutation-symmetry preserving linear combinations. We apply the model to the MovieLens and Fannie Mae datasets, and find that it outperforms the PARAFAC model. We propose some future directions, such as unsupervised-learning."}
{"text": "In this paper we introduce a new optimization formulation for sparse regression and compressed sensing, called CLOT (Combined L-One and Two), wherein the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\\ell_1$- and $\\ell_2$-norms. This formulation differs from the Elastic Net (EN) formulation, in which the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\\ell_1$- and $\\ell_2$-norm squared. It is shown that, in the context of compressed sensing, the EN formulation does not achieve robust recovery of sparse vectors, whereas the new CLOT formulation achieves robust recovery. Also, like EN but unlike LASSO, the CLOT formulation achieves the grouping effect, wherein coefficients of highly correlated columns of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned roughly comparable values. It is already known LASSO does not have the grouping effect. Therefore the CLOT formulation combines the best features of both LASSO (robust sparse recovery) and EN (grouping effect).   The CLOT formulation is a special case of another one called SGL (Sparse Group LASSO) which was introduced into the literature previously, but without any analysis of either the grouping effect or robust sparse recovery. It is shown here that SGL achieves robust sparse recovery, and also achieves a version of the grouping effect in that coefficients of highly correlated columns belonging to the same group of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned roughly comparable values."}

{"text": "Motivated by generating personalized recommendations using ordinal (or preference) data, we study the question of learning a mixture of MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model, a parameterized class of distributions over permutations, from partial ordinal or preference data (e.g. pair-wise comparisons). Despite its long standing importance across disciplines including social choice, operations research and revenue management, little is known about this question. In case of single MNL models (no mixture), computationally and statistically tractable learning from pair-wise comparisons is feasible. However, even learning mixture with two MNL components is infeasible in general.   Given this state of affairs, we seek conditions under which it is feasible to learn the mixture model in both computationally and statistically efficient manner. We present a sufficient condition as well as an efficient algorithm for learning mixed MNL models from partial preferences/comparisons data. In particular, a mixture of $r$ MNL components over $n$ objects can be learnt using samples whose size scales polynomially in $n$ and $r$ (concretely, $r^{3.5}n^3(log n)^4$, with $r\\ll n^{2/7}$ when the model parameters are sufficiently incoherent). The algorithm has two phases: first, learn the pair-wise marginals for each component using tensor decomposition; second, learn the model parameters for each component using Rank Centrality introduced by Negahban et al. In the process of proving these results, we obtain a generalization of existing analysis for tensor decomposition to a more realistic regime where only partial information about each sample is available."}

Such point processes are used in a variety of domains, including neuroscience, geo-statistics and astronomy, but their use is hindered by the computational cost of existing inference schemes. Our scheme: requires no discretisation of the domain; scales linearly in the number of observed events; and is many orders of magnitude faster than previous sampling based approaches. The resulting algorithm is shown to outperform standard methods on synthetic examples, coal mining disaster data and in the prediction of Malaria incidences in Kenya."}
{"text": "We propose a novel sampling framework for inference in probabilistic models: an active learning approach that converges more quickly (in wall-clock time) than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) benchmarks. The central challenge in probabilistic inference is numerical integration, to average over ensembles of models or unknown (hyper-)parameters (for example to compute the marginal likelihood or a partition function). MCMC has provided approaches to numerical integration that deliver state-of-the-art inference, but can suffer from sample inefficiency and poor convergence diagnostics. Bayesian quadrature techniques offer a model-based solution to such problems, but their uptake has been hindered by prohibitive computation costs. We introduce a warped model for probabilistic integrands (likelihoods) that are known to be non-negative, permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations. Our algorithm is demonstrated to offer faster convergence (in seconds) relative to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and real-world examples."}
{"text": "We use statistical learning methods to construct an adaptive state estimator for nonlinear stochastic systems. Optimal state estimation, in the form of a Kalman filter, requires knowledge of the system's process and measurement uncertainty. We propose that these uncertainties can be estimated from (conditioned on) past observed data, and without making any assumptions of the system's prior distribution. The system's prior distribution at each time step is constructed from an ensemble of least-squares estimates on sub-sampled sets of the data via jackknife sampling. As new data is acquired, the state estimates, process uncertainty, and measurement uncertainty are updated accordingly, as described in this manuscript."}
{"text": "The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a ubiquitous, flexible Bayesian nonparametric statistical model. However, full probabilistic inference in this model is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques such as Gibb's sampling are required. As a result, DPM-based methods, which have considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which computational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they would not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware, where computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop simplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithms for DPMs. This algorithm is as simple as K-means clustering, performs in experiments as well as Gibb's sampling, while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort. Unlike related small variance asymptotics, our algorithm is non-degenerate and so inherits the \"rich get richer\" property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate closed-form likelihood which enables standard tools such as cross-validation to be used. This is a well-posed approximation to the MAP solution of the probabilistic DPM model."}
{"text": "This article contains detailed proofs and additional examples related to the UAI-2013 submission `Learning Sparse Causal Models is not NP-hard'. It describes the FCI+ algorithm: a method for sound and complete causal model discovery in the presence of latent confounders and/or selection bias, that has worst case polynomial complexity of order $N^{2(k+1)}$ in the number of independence tests, for sparse graphs over $N$ nodes, bounded by node degree $k$. The algorithm is an adaptation of the well-known FCI algorithm by (Spirtes et al., 2000) that is also sound and complete, but has worst case complexity exponential in $N$."}
{"text": "Variational inference algorithms have proven successful for Bayesian analysis in large data settings, with recent advances using stochastic variational inference (SVI). However, such methods have largely been studied in independent or exchangeable data settings. We develop an SVI algorithm to learn the parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in a time-dependent data setting. The challenge in applying stochastic optimization in this setting arises from dependencies in the chain, which must be broken to consider minibatches of observations. We propose an algorithm that harnesses the memory decay of the chain to adaptively bound errors arising from edge effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic experiments and a large genomics dataset where a batch algorithm is computationally infeasible."}
{"text": "Probabilistic programming languages can simplify the development of machine learning techniques, but only if inference is sufficiently scalable. Unfortunately, Bayesian parameter estimation for highly coupled models such as regressions and state-space models still scales poorly; each MCMC transition takes linear time in the number of observations. This paper describes a sublinear-time algorithm for making Metropolis-Hastings (MH) updates to latent variables in probabilistic programs. The approach generalizes recently introduced approximate MH techniques: instead of subsampling data items assumed to be independent, it subsamples edges in a dynamically constructed graphical model. It thus applies to a broader class of problems and interoperates with other general-purpose inference techniques. Empirical results, including confirmation of sublinear per-transition scaling, are presented for Bayesian logistic regression, nonlinear classification via joint Dirichlet process mixtures, and parameter estimation for stochastic volatility models (with state estimation via particle MCMC). All three applications use the same implementation, and each requires under 20 lines of probabilistic code."}
{"text": "Gaussian process classification is a popular method with a number of appealing properties. We show how to scale the model within a variational inducing point framework, outperforming the state of the art on benchmark datasets. Importantly, the variational formulation can be exploited to allow classification in problems with millions of data points, as we demonstrate in experiments."}
{"text": "This paper considers statistical estimation problems where the probability distribution of the observed random variable is invariant with respect to actions of a finite topological group. It is shown that any such distribution must satisfy a restricted finite mixture representation. When specialized to the case of distributions over the sphere that are invariant to the actions of a finite spherical symmetry group $\\mathcal G$, a group-invariant extension of the Von Mises Fisher (VMF) distribution is obtained. The $\\mathcal G$-invariant VMF is parameterized by location and scale parameters that specify the distribution's mean orientation and its concentration about the mean, respectively. Using the restricted finite mixture representation these parameters can be estimated using an Expectation Maximization (EM) maximum likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm. This is illustrated for the problem of mean crystal orientation estimation under the spherically symmetric group associated with the crystal form, e.g., cubic or octahedral or hexahedral. Simulations and experiments establish the advantages of the extended VMF EM-ML estimator for data acquired by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) microscopy of a polycrystalline Nickel alloy sample."}
{"text": "Classical stochastic gradient methods are well suited for minimizing expected-value objective functions. However, they do not apply to the minimization of a nonlinear function involving expected values or a composition of two expected-value functions, i.e., problems of the form $\\min_x \\mathbf{E}_v [f_v\\big(\\mathbf{E}_w [g_w(x)]\\big)]$. In order to solve this stochastic composition problem, we propose a class of stochastic compositional gradient descent (SCGD) algorithms that can be viewed as stochastic versions of quasi-gradient method. SCGD update the solutions based on noisy sample gradients of $f_v,g_{w}$ and use an auxiliary variable to track the unknown quantity $\\mathbf{E}_w[g_w(x)]$. We prove that the SCGD converge almost surely to an optimal solution for convex optimization problems, as long as such a solution exists. The convergence involves the interplay of two iterations with different time scales. For nonsmooth convex problems, the SCGD achieve a convergence rate of $O(k^{-1/4})$ in the general case and $O(k^{-2/3})$ in the strongly convex case, after taking $k$ samples. For smooth convex problems, the SCGD can be accelerated to converge at a rate of $O(k^{-2/7})$ in the general case and $O(k^{-4/5})$ in the strongly convex case. For nonconvex problems, we prove that any limit point generated by SCGD is a stationary point, for which we also provide the convergence rate analysis. Indeed, the stochastic setting where one wants to optimize compositions of expected-value functions is very common in practice. The proposed SCGD methods find wide applications in learning, estimation, dynamic programming, etc."}
{"text": "A widely applied approach to causal inference from a non-experimental time series $X$, often referred to as \"(linear) Granger causal analysis\", is to regress present on past and interpret the regression matrix $\\hat{B}$ causally. However, if there is an unmeasured time series $Z$ that influences $X$, then this approach can lead to wrong causal conclusions, i.e., distinct from those one would draw if one had additional information such as $Z$. In this paper we take a different approach: We assume that $X$ together with some hidden $Z$ forms a first order vector autoregressive (VAR) process with transition matrix $A$, and argue why it is more valid to interpret $A$ causally instead of $\\hat{B}$. Then we examine under which conditions the most important parts of $A$ are identifiable or almost identifiable from only $X$. Essentially, sufficient conditions are (1) non-Gaussian, independent noise or (2) no influence from $X$ to $Z$. We present two estimation algorithms that are tailored towards conditions (1) and (2), respectively, and evaluate them on synthetic and real-world data. We discuss how to check the model using $X$."}
{"text": "While robust parameter estimation has been well studied in parametric density estimation, there has been little investigation into robust density estimation in the nonparametric setting. We present a robust version of the popular kernel density estimator (KDE). As with other estimators, a robust version of the KDE is useful since sample contamination is a common issue with datasets. What \"robustness\" means for a nonparametric density estimate is not straightforward and is a topic we explore in this paper. To construct a robust KDE we scale the traditional KDE and project it to its nearest weighted KDE in the $L^2$ norm. This yields a scaled and projected KDE (SPKDE). Because the squared $L^2$ norm penalizes point-wise errors superlinearly this causes the weighted KDE to allocate more weight to high density regions. We demonstrate the robustness of the SPKDE with numerical experiments and a consistency result which shows that asymptotically the SPKDE recovers the uncontaminated density under sufficient conditions on the contamination."}
{"text": "In this article, we derive a new stepsize adaptation for the normalized least mean square algorithm (NLMS) by describing the task of linear acoustic echo cancellation from a Bayesian network perspective. Similar to the well-known Kalman filter equations, we model the acoustic wave propagation from the loudspeaker to the microphone by a latent state vector and define a linear observation equation (to model the relation between the state vector and the observation) as well as a linear process equation (to model the temporal progress of the state vector). Based on additional assumptions on the statistics of the random variables in observation and process equation, we apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to derive an NLMS-like filter adaptation. By exploiting the conditional independence rules for Bayesian networks, we reveal that the resulting EM-NLMS algorithm has a stepsize update equivalent to the optimal-stepsize calculation proposed by Yamamoto and Kitayama in 1982, which has been adopted in many textbooks. As main difference, the instantaneous stepsize value is estimated in the M step of the EM algorithm (instead of being approximated by artificially extending the acoustic echo path). The EM-NLMS algorithm is experimentally verified for synthesized scenarios with both, white noise and male speech as input signal."}
{"text": "Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is the only method we currently have to measure connections between different parts of the human brain in vivo. To elucidate the structure of these connections, algorithms for tracking bundles of axonal fibers through the subcortical white matter rely on local estimates of the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in different parts of the brain. These functions describe the relative abundance of populations of axonal fibers crossing each other in each location. Multiple models exist for estimating fODFs. The quality of the resulting estimates can be quantified by means of a suitable measure of distance on the space of fODFs. However, there are multiple distance metrics that can be applied for this purpose, including smoothed $L_p$ distances and the Wasserstein metrics. Here, we give four reasons for the use of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) equipped with the arc-length, as a distance metric. (continued)"}
{"text": "Factor analysis provides linear factors that describe relationships between individual variables of a data set. We extend this classical formulation into linear factors that describe relationships between groups of variables, where each group represents either a set of related variables or a data set. The model also naturally extends canonical correlation analysis to more than two sets, in a way that is more flexible than previous extensions. Our solution is formulated as variational inference of a latent variable model with structural sparsity, and it consists of two hierarchical levels: The higher level models the relationships between the groups, whereas the lower models the observed variables given the higher level. We show that the resulting solution solves the group factor analysis problem accurately, outperforming alternative factor analysis based solutions as well as more straightforward implementations of group factor analysis. The method is demonstrated on two life science data sets, one on brain activation and the other on systems biology, illustrating its applicability to the analysis of different types of high-dimensional data sources."}
{"text": "Several problems such as network intrusion, community detection, and disease outbreak can be described by observations attributed to nodes or edges of a graph. In these applications presence of intrusion, community or disease outbreak is characterized by novel observations on some unknown connected subgraph. These problems can be formulated in terms of optimization of suitable objectives on connected subgraphs, a problem which is generally computationally difficult. We overcome the combinatorics of connectivity by embedding connected subgraphs into linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Computationally efficient tests are then realized by optimizing convex objective functions subject to these LMI constraints. We prove, by means of a novel Euclidean embedding argument, that our tests are minimax optimal for exponential family of distributions on 1-D and 2-D lattices. We show that internal conductance of the connected subgraph family plays a fundamental role in characterizing detectability."}
{"text": "This article considers the problem of multi-group classification in the setting where the number of variables $p$ is larger than the number of observations $n$. Several methods have been proposed in the literature that address this problem, however their variable selection performance is either unknown or suboptimal to the results known in the two-group case. In this work we provide sharp conditions for the consistent recovery of relevant variables in the multi-group case using the discriminant analysis proposal of Gaynanova et al., 2014. We achieve the rates of convergence that attain the optimal scaling of the sample size $n$, number of variables $p$ and the sparsity level $s$. These rates are significantly faster than the best known results in the multi-group case. Moreover, they coincide with the optimal minimax rates for the two-group case. We validate our theoretical results with numerical analysis."}
{"text": "In theory, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are well suited to streaming data scenarios due to their ability to adapt model complexity with the observed data. Unfortunately, such benefits have not been fully realized in practice; existing inference algorithms are either not applicable to streaming applications or not extensible to BNP models. For the special case of Dirichlet processes, streaming inference has been considered. However, there is growing interest in more flexible BNP models building on the class of normalized random measures (NRMs). We work within this general framework and present a streaming variational inference algorithm for NRM mixture models. Our algorithm is based on assumed density filtering (ADF), leading straightforwardly to expectation propagation (EP) for large-scale batch inference as well. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on clustering documents in large, streaming text corpora."}
{"text": "Deep Gaussian processes provide a flexible approach to probabilistic modelling of data using either supervised or unsupervised learning. For tractable inference approximations to the marginal likelihood of the model must be made. The original approach to approximate inference in these models used variational compression to allow for approximate variational marginalization of the hidden variables leading to a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model [Damianou and Lawrence, 2013]. In this paper we extend this idea with a nested variational compression. The resulting lower bound on the likelihood can be easily parallelized or adapted for stochastic variational inference."}
{"text": "We propose a likelihood ratio based inferential framework for high dimensional semiparametric generalized linear models. This framework addresses a variety of challenging problems in high dimensional data analysis, including incomplete data, selection bias, and heterogeneous multitask learning. Our work has three main contributions. (i) We develop a regularized statistical chromatography approach to infer the parameter of interest under the proposed semiparametric generalized linear model without the need of estimating the unknown base measure function. (ii) We propose a new framework to construct post-regularization confidence regions and tests for the low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. Unlike existing post-regularization inferential methods, our approach is based on a novel directional likelihood. In particular, the framework naturally handles generic regularized estimators with nonconvex penalty functions and it can be used to infer least false parameters under misspecified models. (iii) We develop new concentration inequalities and normal approximation results for U-statistics with unbounded kernels, which are of independent interest. We demonstrate the consequences of the general theory by using an example of missing data problem. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis are provided to illustrate our proposed approach."}
{"text": "Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis which is made more challenging by overlaps between communities which often occur in practice. Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative model for overlapping communities, which can be thought of as a generalization of the degree-corrected stochastic block model. We develop an efficient spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with the overlaps by employing the K-medians algorithm rather than the usual K-means for clustering in the spectral domain. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when networks are not too sparse and the overlaps between communities not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs very well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection."}
{"text": "Matching datasets of multiple modalities has become an important task in data analysis. Existing methods often rely on the embedding and transformation of each single modality without utilizing any correspondence information, which often results in sub-optimal matching performance. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear manifold matching algorithm using shortest-path distance and joint neighborhood selection. Specifically, a joint nearest-neighbor graph is built for all modalities. Then the shortest-path distance within each modality is calculated from the joint neighborhood graph, followed by embedding into and matching in a common low-dimensional Euclidean space. Compared to existing algorithms, our approach exhibits superior performance for matching disparate datasets of multiple modalities."}
{"text": "We introduce Bayesian multi-tensor factorization, a model that is the first Bayesian formulation for joint factorization of multiple matrices and tensors. The research problem generalizes the joint matrix-tensor factorization problem to arbitrary sets of tensors of any depth, including matrices, can be interpreted as unsupervised multi-view learning from multiple data tensors, and can be generalized to relax the usual trilinear tensor factorization assumptions. The result is a factorization of the set of tensors into factors shared by any subsets of the tensors, and factors private to individual tensors. We demonstrate the performance against existing baselines in multiple tensor factorization tasks in structural toxicogenomics and functional neuroimaging."}
{"text": "Two recently introduced criteria for estimation of generative models are both based on a reduction to binary classification. Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is an estimation procedure in which a generative model is trained to be able to distinguish data samples from noise samples. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are pairs of generator and discriminator networks, with the generator network learning to generate samples by attempting to fool the discriminator network into believing its samples are real data. Both estimation procedures use the same function to drive learning, which naturally raises questions about how they are related to each other, as well as whether this function is related to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). NCE corresponds to training an internal data model belonging to the {\\em discriminator} network but using a fixed generator network. We show that a variant of NCE, with a dynamic generator network, is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation. Since pairing a learned discriminator with an appropriate dynamically selected generator recovers MLE, one might expect the reverse to hold for pairing a learned generator with a certain discriminator. However, we show that recovering MLE for a learned generator requires departing from the distinguishability game. Specifically:   (i) The expected gradient of the NCE discriminator can be made to match the expected gradient of   MLE, if one is allowed to use a non-stationary noise distribution for NCE,   (ii) No choice of discriminator network can make the expected gradient for the GAN generator match that of MLE, and   (iii) The existing theory does not guarantee that GANs will converge in the non-convex case.   This suggests that the key next step in GAN research is to determine whether GANs converge, and if not, to modify their training algorithm to force convergence."}
{"text": "High-dimensional data often lie in low-dimensional subspaces corresponding to different classes they belong to. Finding sparse representations of data points in a dictionary built using the collection of data helps to uncover low-dimensional subspaces and address problems such as clustering, classification, subset selection and more. In this paper, we address the problem of recovering sparse representations for noisy data points in a dictionary whose columns correspond to corrupted data lying close to a union of subspaces. We consider a constrained $\\ell_1$-minimization and study conditions under which the solution of the proposed optimization satisfies the approximate subspace-sparse recovery condition. More specifically, we show that each noisy data point, perturbed from a subspace by a noise of the magnitude of $\\varepsilon$, will be reconstructed using data points from the same subspace with a small error of the order of $O(\\varepsilon)$ and that the coefficients corresponding to data points in other subspaces will be sufficiently small, \\ie, of the order of $O(\\varepsilon)$. We do not impose any randomness assumption on the arrangement of subspaces or distribution of data points in each subspace. Our framework is based on a novel generalization of the null-space property to the setting where data lie in multiple subspaces, the number of data points in each subspace exceeds the dimension of the subspace, and all data points are corrupted by noise. Moreover, assuming a random distribution for data points, we further show that coefficients from the desired support not only reconstruct a given point with high accuracy, but also have sufficiently large values, \\ie, of the order of $O(1)$."}
{"text": "Given $n$ i.i.d. observations of a random vector $(X,Z)$, where $X$ is a high-dimensional vector and $Z$ is a low-dimensional index variable, we study the problem of estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix $\\Omega(z) = (E[(X-E[X \\mid Z])(X-E[X \\mid Z])^T \\mid Z=z])^{-1}$ under the assumption that the set of non-zero elements is small and does not depend on the index variable. We develop a novel procedure that combines the ideas of the local constant smoothing and the group Lasso for estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix. A proximal iterative smoothing algorithm is used to solve the corresponding convex optimization problems. We prove that our procedure recovers the conditional independence assumptions of the distribution $X \\mid Z$ with high probability. This result is established by developing a uniform deviation bound for the high-dimensional conditional covariance matrix from its population counterpart, which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we develop point-wise confidence intervals for individual elements of the conditional inverse covariance matrix. We perform extensive simulation studies, in which we demonstrate that our proposed procedure outperforms sensible competitors. We illustrate our proposal on a S&P 500 stock price data set."}
{"text": "Recent studies in the literature have paid much attention to the sparsity in linear classification tasks. One motivation of imposing sparsity assumption on the linear discriminant direction is to rule out the noninformative features, making hardly contribution to the classification problem. Most of those work were focused on the scenarios of binary classification. In the presence of multi-class data, preceding researches recommended individually pairwise sparse linear discriminant analysis(LDA). However, further sparsity should be explored. In this paper, an estimator of grouped LASSO type is proposed to take advantage of sparsity for multi-class data. It enjoys appealing non-asymptotic properties which allows insignificant correlations among features. This estimator exhibits superior capability on both simulated and real data."}
{"text": "We propose a new class of semiparametric exponential family graphical models for the analysis of high dimensional mixed data. Different from the existing mixed graphical models, we allow the nodewise conditional distributions to be semiparametric generalized linear models with unspecified base measure functions. Thus, one advantage of our method is that it is unnecessary to specify the type of each node and the method is more convenient to apply in practice. Under the proposed model, we consider both problems of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing in high dimensions. In particular, we propose a symmetric pairwise score test for the presence of a single edge in the graph. Compared to the existing methods for hypothesis tests, our approach takes into account of the symmetry of the parameters, such that the inferential results are invariant with respect to the different parametrizations of the same edge. Thorough numerical simulations and a real data example are provided to back up our results."}
{"text": "We propose a robust inferential procedure for assessing uncertainties of parameter estimation in high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension $p$ can grow exponentially fast with the sample size $n$. Our method combines the de-biasing technique with the composite quantile function to construct an estimator that is asymptotically normal. Hence it can be used to construct valid confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. Our estimator is robust and does not require the existence of first or second moment of the noise distribution. It also preserves efficiency in the sense that the worst case efficiency loss is less than 30\\% compared to the square-loss-based de-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better than the latter, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Our de-biasing procedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized composite quantile regression. Instead, it allows for any first-stage estimator with desired convergence rate and empirical sparsity. The paper also provides new proof techniques for developing theoretical guarantees of inferential procedures with non-smooth loss functions. To establish the main results, we exploit the local curvature of the conditional expectation of composite quantile loss and apply empirical process theories to control the difference between empirical quantities and their conditional expectations. Our results are established under weaker assumptions compared to existing work on inference for high-dimensional quantile regression. Furthermore, we consider a high-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameters by applying the Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. We also study distributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce computation complexity when the sample size is massive. Finally, we provide empirical results to verify the theory."}
{"text": "We provide a general theory of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for inferring high dimensional latent variable models. In particular, we make two contributions: (i) For parameter estimation, we propose a novel high dimensional EM algorithm which naturally incorporates sparsity structure into parameter estimation. With an appropriate initialization, this algorithm converges at a geometric rate and attains an estimator with the (near-)optimal statistical rate of convergence. (ii) Based on the obtained estimator, we propose new inferential procedures for testing hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals for low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. For a broad family of statistical models, our framework establishes the first computationally feasible approach for optimal estimation and asymptotic inference in high dimensions. Our theory is supported by thorough numerical results."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of uncertainty assessment for low dimensional components in high dimensional models. Specifically, we propose a decorrelated score function to handle the impact of high dimensional nuisance parameters. We consider both hypothesis tests and confidence regions for generic penalized M-estimators. Unlike most existing inferential methods which are tailored for individual models, our approach provides a general framework for high dimensional inference and is applicable to a wide range of applications. From the testing perspective, we develop general theorems to characterize the limiting distributions of the decorrelated score test statistic under both null hypothesis and local alternatives. These results provide asymptotic guarantees on the type I errors and local powers of the proposed test. Furthermore, we show that the decorrelated score function can be used to construct point and confidence region estimators that are semiparametrically efficient. We also generalize this framework to broaden its applications. First, we extend it to handle high dimensional null hypothesis, where the number of parameters of interest can increase exponentially fast with the sample size. Second, we establish the theory for model misspecification. Third, we go beyond the likelihood framework, by introducing the generalized score test based on general loss functions. Thorough numerical studies are conducted to back up the developed theoretical results."}
{"text": "Recently theoretical guarantees have been obtained for matrix completion in the non-uniform sampling regime. In particular, if the sampling distribution aligns with the underlying matrix's leverage scores, then with high probability nuclear norm minimization will exactly recover the low rank matrix. In this article, we analyze the scenario in which the non-uniform sampling distribution may or may not not align with the underlying matrix's leverage scores. Here we explore learning the parameters for weighted nuclear norm minimization in terms of the empirical sampling distribution. We provide a sufficiency condition for these learned weights which provide an exact recovery guarantee for weighted nuclear norm minimization. It has been established that a specific choice of weights in terms of the true sampling distribution not only allows for weighted nuclear norm minimization to exactly recover the low rank matrix, but also allows for a quantifiable relaxation in the exact recovery conditions. In this article we extend this quantifiable relaxation in exact recovery conditions for a specific choice of weights defined analogously in terms of the empirical distribution as opposed to the true sampling distribution. To accomplish this we employ a concentration of measure bound and a large deviation bound. We also present numerical evidence for the healthy robustness of the weighted nuclear norm minimization algorithm to the choice of empirically learned weights. These numerical experiments show that for a variety of easily computable empirical weights, weighted nuclear norm minimization outperforms unweighted nuclear norm minimization in the non-uniform sampling regime."}
{"text": "Big data comes in various ways, types, shapes, forms and sizes. Indeed, almost all areas of science, technology, medicine, public health, economics, business, linguistics and social science are bombarded by ever increasing flows of data begging to analyzed efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we propose a rough idea of a possible taxonomy of big data, along with some of the most commonly used tools for handling each particular category of bigness. The dimensionality p of the input space and the sample size n are usually the main ingredients in the characterization of data bigness. The specific statistical machine learning technique used to handle a particular big data set will depend on which category it falls in within the bigness taxonomy. Large p small n data sets for instance require a different set of tools from the large n small p variety. Among other tools, we discuss Preprocessing, Standardization, Imputation, Projection, Regularization, Penalization, Compression, Reduction, Selection, Kernelization, Hybridization, Parallelization, Aggregation, Randomization, Replication, Sequentialization. Indeed, it is important to emphasize right away that the so-called no free lunch theorem applies here, in the sense that there is no universally superior method that outperforms all other methods on all categories of bigness. It is also important to stress the fact that simplicity in the sense of Ockham's razor non plurality principle of parsimony tends to reign supreme when it comes to massive data. We conclude with a comparison of the predictive performance of some of the most commonly used methods on a few data sets."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of unveiling the implicit network structure of node interactions (such as user interactions in a social network), based only on high-frequency timestamps. Our inference is based on the minimization of the least-squares loss associated with a multivariate Hawkes model, penalized by $\\ell_1$ and trace norm of the interaction tensor. We provide a first theoretical analysis for this problem, that includes sparsity and low-rank inducing penalizations. This result involves a new data-driven concentration inequality for matrix martingales in continuous time with observable variance, which is a result of independent interest and a broad range of possible applications since it extends to matrix martingales former results restricted to the scalar case. A consequence of our analysis is the construction of sharply tuned $\\ell_1$ and trace-norm penalizations, that leads to a data-driven scaling of the variability of information available for each users. Numerical experiments illustrate the significant improvements achieved by the use of such data-driven penalizations."}
{"text": "This paper is concerned with the problems of interaction screening and nonlinear classification in a high-dimensional setting. We propose a two-step procedure, IIS-SQDA, where in the first step an innovated interaction screening (IIS) approach based on transforming the original $p$-dimensional feature vector is proposed, and in the second step a sparse quadratic discriminant analysis (SQDA) is proposed for further selecting important interactions and main effects and simultaneously conducting classification. Our IIS approach screens important interactions by examining only $p$ features instead of all two-way interactions of order $O(p^2)$. Our theory shows that the proposed method enjoys sure screening property in interaction selection in the high-dimensional setting of $p$ growing exponentially with the sample size. In the selection and classification step, we establish a sparse inequality on the estimated coefficient vector for QDA and prove that the classification error of our procedure can be upper-bounded by the oracle classification error plus some smaller order term. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis show that our proposal compares favorably with existing methods in interaction selection and high-dimensional classification."}
{"text": "Measuring dependence between two random variables is very important, and critical in many applied areas such as variable selection, brain network analysis. However, we do not know what kind of functional relationship is between two covariates, which requires the dependence measure to be equitable. That is, it gives similar scores to equally noisy relationship of different types. In fact, the dependence score is a continuous random variable taking values in $[0,1]$, thus it is theoretically impossible to give similar scores. In this paper, we introduce a new definition of equitability of a dependence measure, i.e, power-equitable (weak-equitable) and show by simulation that HHG and Copula Dependence Coefficient (CDC) are weak-equitable."}
{"text": "In certain situations that shall be undoubtedly more and more common in the Big Data era, the datasets available are so massive that computing statistics over the full sample is hardly feasible, if not unfeasible. A natural approach in this context consists in using survey schemes and substituting the \"full data\" statistics with their counterparts based on the resulting random samples, of manageable size. It is the main purpose of this paper to investigate the impact of survey sampling with unequal inclusion probabilities on stochastic gradient descent-based M-estimation methods in large-scale statistical and machine-learning problems. Precisely, we prove that, in presence of some a priori information, one may significantly increase asymptotic accuracy when choosing appropriate first order inclusion probabilities, without affecting complexity. These striking results are described here by limit theorems and are also illustrated by numerical experiments."}
{"text": "Using a Bayesian approach, we consider the problem of recovering sparse signals under additive sparse and dense noise. Typically, sparse noise models outliers, impulse bursts or data loss. To handle sparse noise, existing methods simultaneously estimate the sparse signal of interest and the sparse noise of no interest. For estimating the sparse signal, without the need of estimating the sparse noise, we construct a robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In the RVM, sparse noise and ever present dense noise are treated through a combined noise model. The precision of combined noise is modeled by a diagonal matrix. We show that the new RVM update equations correspond to a non-symmetric sparsity inducing cost function. Further, the combined modeling is found to be computationally more efficient. We also extend the method to block-sparse signals and noise with known and unknown block structures. Through simulations, we show the performance and computation efficiency of the new RVM in several applications: recovery of sparse and block sparse signals, housing price prediction and image denoising."}
{"text": "Item response theory (IRT) models for categorical response data are widely used in the analysis of educational data, computerized adaptive testing, and psychological surveys. However, most IRT models rely on both the assumption that categories are strictly ordered and the assumption that this ordering is known a priori. These assumptions are impractical in many real-world scenarios, such as multiple-choice exams where the levels of incorrectness for the distractor categories are often unknown. While a number of results exist on IRT models for unordered categorical data, they tend to have restrictive modeling assumptions that lead to poor data fitting performance in practice. Furthermore, existing unordered categorical models have parameters that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for unordered categorical IRT that we call SPRITE (short for stochastic polytomous response item model) that: (i) analyzes both ordered and unordered categories, (ii) offers interpretable outputs, and (iii) provides improved data fitting compared to existing models. We compare SPRITE to existing item response models and demonstrate its efficacy on both synthetic and real-world educational datasets."}
{"text": "Using nonparametric methods has been increasingly explored in Bayesian hierarchical modeling as a way to increase model flexibility. Although the field shows a lot of promise, inference in many models, including Hierachical Dirichlet Processes (HDP), remain prohibitively slow. One promising path forward is to exploit the submodularity inherent in Indian Buffet Process (IBP) to derive near-optimal solutions in polynomial time. In this work, I will present a brief tutorial on Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially as they are applied to topic modeling. I will show a comparison between different non-parametric models and the current state-of-the-art parametric model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)."}
{"text": "Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of a wide variety of machine learning models. The success of machine learning has led practitioners in diverse real-world settings to learn classifiers for practical problems. As machine learning becomes commonplace, Bayesian optimization becomes an attractive method for practitioners to automate the process of classifier hyper-parameter tuning. A key observation is that the data used for tuning models in these settings is often sensitive. Certain data such as genetic predisposition, personal email statistics, and car accident history, if not properly private, may be at risk of being inferred from Bayesian optimization outputs. To address this, we introduce methods for releasing the best hyper-parameters and classifier accuracy privately. Leveraging the strong theoretical guarantees of differential privacy and known Bayesian optimization convergence bounds, we prove that under a GP assumption these private quantities are also near-optimal. Finally, even if this assumption is not satisfied, we can use different smoothness guarantees to protect privacy."}
{"text": "We consider the setting of linear regression in high dimension. We focus on the problem of constructing adaptive and honest confidence sets for the sparse parameter \\theta, i.e. we want to construct a confidence set for theta that contains theta with high probability, and that is as small as possible. The l_2 diameter of a such confidence set should depend on the sparsity S of \\theta - the larger S, the wider the confidence set. However, in practice, S is unknown. This paper focuses on constructing a confidence set for \\theta which contains \\theta with high probability, whose diameter is adaptive to the unknown sparsity S, and which is implementable in practice."}
{"text": "Graphical models provide powerful tools to uncover complicated patterns in multivariate data and are commonly used in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we introduce the R package BDgraph which performs Bayesian structure learning for general undirected graphical models (decomposable and non-decomposable) with continuous, discrete, and mixed variables. The package efficiently implements recent improvements in the Bayesian literature, including that of Mohammadi and Wit (2015) and Dobra and Mohammadi (2018). To speed up computations, the computationally intensive tasks have been implemented in C++ and interfaced with R, and the package has parallel computing capabilities. In addition, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as several multivariate datasets taken from the literature and used to describe the package capabilities. The paper includes a brief overview of the statistical methods which have been implemented in the package. The main part of the paper explains how to use the package. Furthermore, we illustrate the package's functionality in both real and artificial examples."}
{"text": "We are motivated by problems that arise in a number of applications such as Online Marketing and Explosives detection, where the observations are usually modeled using Poisson statistics. We model each observation as a Poisson random variable whose mean is a sparse linear superposition of known patterns. Unlike many conventional problems observations here are not identically distributed since they are associated with different sensing modalities. We analyze the performance of a Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder, which for our Poisson setting involves a non-linear optimization but yet is computationally tractable. We derive fundamental sample complexity bounds for sparse recovery when the measurements are contaminated with Poisson noise. In contrast to the least-squares linear regression setting with Gaussian noise, we observe that in addition to sparsity, the scale of the parameters also fundamentally impacts $\\ell_2$ error in the Poisson setting. We show tightness of our upper bounds both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we derive a minimax matching lower bound on the mean-squared error and show that our constrained ML decoder is minimax optimal for this regime."}
{"text": "A statistical test of independence may be constructed using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a test statistic. The HSIC is defined as the distance between the embedding of the joint distribution, and the embedding of the product of the marginals, in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). It has previously been shown that when the kernel used in defining the joint embedding is characteristic (that is, the embedding of the joint distribution to the feature space is injective), then the HSIC-based test is consistent. In particular, it is sufficient for the product of kernels on the individual domains to be characteristic on the joint domain. In this note, it is established via a result of Lyons (2013) that HSIC-based independence tests are consistent when kernels on the marginals are characteristic on their respective domains, even when the product of kernels is not characteristic on the joint domain."}
{"text": "This paper introduces and develops a novel variable importance score function in the context of ensemble learning and demonstrates its appeal both theoretically and empirically. Our proposed score function is simple and more straightforward than its counterpart proposed in the context of random forest, and by avoiding permutations, it is by design computationally more efficient than the random forest variable importance function. Just like the random forest variable importance function, our score handles both regression and classification seamlessly. One of the distinct advantage of our proposed score is the fact that it offers a natural cut off at zero, with all the positive scores indicating importance and significance, while the negative scores are deemed indications of insignificance. An extra advantage of our proposed score lies in the fact it works very well beyond ensemble of trees and can seamlessly be used with any base learners in the random subspace learning context. Our examples, both simulated and real, demonstrate that our proposed score does compete mostly favorably with the random forest score."}
{"text": "AB-testing is a very popular technique in web companies since it makes it possible to accurately predict the impact of a modification with the simplicity of a random split across users. One of the critical aspects of an AB-test is its duration and it is important to reliably compute confidence intervals associated with the metric of interest to know when to stop the test. In this paper, we define a clean mathematical framework to model the AB-test process. We then propose three algorithms based on bootstrapping and on the central limit theorem to compute reliable confidence intervals which extend to other metrics than the common probabilities of success. They apply to both absolute and relative increments of the most used comparison metrics, including the number of occurrences of a particular event and a click-through rate implying a ratio."}
{"text": "Laplacian mixture models identify overlapping regions of influence in unlabeled graph and network data in a scalable and computationally efficient way, yielding useful low-dimensional representations. By combining Laplacian eigenspace and finite mixture modeling methods, they provide probabilistic or fuzzy dimensionality reductions or domain decompositions for a variety of input data types, including mixture distributions, feature vectors, and graphs or networks. Provable optimal recovery using the algorithm is analytically shown for a nontrivial class of cluster graphs. Heuristic approximations for scalable high-performance implementations are described and empirically tested. Connections to PageRank and community detection in network analysis demonstrate the wide applicability of this approach. The origins of fuzzy spectral methods, beginning with generalized heat or diffusion equations in physics, are reviewed and summarized. Comparisons to other dimensionality reduction and clustering methods for challenging unsupervised machine learning problems are also discussed."}
{"text": "Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied problems in statistics and machine learning that have found many applications in science and engineering. However, exact inference is intractable in general graphical models, which suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a collection of random variables within some tractable family of graphical models. In this paper, we focus on the class of planar Ising models, for which exact inference is tractable using techniques of statistical physics. Based on these techniques and recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method in simulations and for the application of modeling senate voting records."}
{"text": "The sparse representation classifier (SRC) has been utilized in various classification problems, which makes use of L1 minimization and works well for image recognition satisfying a subspace assumption. In this paper we propose a new implementation of SRC via screening, establish its equivalence to the original SRC under regularity conditions, and prove its classification consistency under a latent subspace model and contamination. The results are demonstrated via simulations and real data experiments, where the new algorithm achieves comparable numerical performance and significantly faster."}
{"text": "We propose a novel sparse tensor decomposition method, namely Tensor Truncated Power (TTP) method, that incorporates variable selection into the estimation of decomposition components. The sparsity is achieved via an efficient truncation step embedded in the tensor power iteration. Our method applies to a broad family of high dimensional latent variable models, including high dimensional Gaussian mixture and mixtures of sparse regressions. A thorough theoretical investigation is further conducted. In particular, we show that the final decomposition estimator is guaranteed to achieve a local statistical rate, and further strengthen it to the global statistical rate by introducing a proper initialization procedure. In high dimensional regimes, the obtained statistical rate significantly improves those shown in the existing non-sparse decomposition methods. The empirical advantages of TTP are confirmed in extensive simulated results and two real applications of click-through rate prediction and high-dimensional gene clustering."}
{"text": "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) have found many applications in density estimation and data clustering. However, the model does not adapt well to curved and strongly nonlinear data. Recently there appeared an improvement called AcaGMM (Active curve axis Gaussian Mixture Model), which fits Gaussians along curves using an EM-like (Expectation Maximization) approach.   Using the ideas standing behind AcaGMM, we build an alternative active function model of clustering, which has some advantages over AcaGMM. In particular it is naturally defined in arbitrary dimensions and enables an easy adaptation to clustering of complicated datasets along the predefined family of functions. Moreover, it does not need external methods to determine the number of clusters as it automatically reduces the number of groups on-line."}
{"text": "Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) are probability distributions over vector-valued functions, and have been previously used for multi-output regression and for multi-class classification. A less explored facet of the multi-output Gaussian process is that it can be used as a generative model for vector-valued random fields in the context of pattern recognition. As a generative model, the multi-output GP is able to handle vector-valued functions with continuous inputs, as opposed, for example, to hidden Markov models. It also offers the ability to model multivariate random functions with high dimensional inputs. In this report, we use a discriminative training criteria known as Minimum Classification Error to fit the parameters of a multi-output Gaussian process. We compare the performance of generative training and discriminative training of MOGP in emotion recognition, activity recognition, and face recognition. We also compare the proposed methodology against hidden Markov models trained in a generative and in a discriminative way."}
{"text": "There has been an explosion of interest in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) during the past two decades. Naturally, this has been accompanied by many major advances in the understanding of the human connectome. These advances have served to pose novel challenges as well as open new avenues for research. One of the most promising and exciting of such avenues is the study of functional MRI in real-time. Such studies have recently gained momentum and have been applied in a wide variety of settings; ranging from training of healthy subjects to self-regulate neuronal activity to being suggested as potential treatments for clinical populations. To date, the vast majority of these studies have focused on a single region at a time. This is due in part to the many challenges faced when estimating dynamic functional connectivity networks in real-time. In this work we propose a novel methodology with which to accurately track changes in functional connectivity networks in real-time. We adapt the recently proposed SINGLE algorithm for estimating sparse and temporally homo- geneous dynamic networks to be applicable in real-time. The proposed method is applied to motor task data from the Human Connectome Project as well as to real-time data ob- tained while exploring a virtual environment. We show that the algorithm is able to estimate significant task-related changes in network structure quickly enough to be useful in future brain-computer interface applications."}
{"text": "Careful tuning of a regularization parameter is indispensable in many machine learning tasks because it has a significant impact on generalization performances. Nevertheless, current practice of regularization parameter tuning is more of an art than a science, e.g., it is hard to tell how many grid-points would be needed in cross-validation (CV) for obtaining a solution with sufficiently small CV error. In this paper we propose a novel framework for computing a lower bound of the CV errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which we call regularization path of CV error lower bounds. The proposed framework can be used for providing a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions in the sense that how far the CV error of the current best solution could be away from best possible CV error in the entire range of the regularization parameters. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that a theoretically guaranteed a choice of regularization parameter in the above sense is possible with reasonable computational costs."}
{"text": "This paper proposes a unified framework to quantify local and global inferential uncertainty for high dimensional nonparanormal graphical models. In particular, we consider the problems of testing the presence of a single edge and constructing a uniform confidence subgraph. Due to the presence of unknown marginal transformations, we propose a pseudo likelihood based inferential approach. In sharp contrast to the existing high dimensional score test method, our method is free of tuning parameters given an initial estimator, and extends the scope of the existing likelihood based inferential framework. Furthermore, we propose a U-statistic multiplier bootstrap method to construct the confidence subgraph. We show that the constructed subgraph is contained in the true graph with probability greater than a given nominal level. Compared with existing methods for constructing confidence subgraphs, our method does not rely on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions. The theoretical properties of the proposed inferential methods are verified by thorough numerical experiments and real data analysis."}
{"text": "To scale Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets we introduce the robust Bayesian Committee Machine (rBCM), a practical and scalable product-of-experts model for large-scale distributed GP regression. Unlike state-of-the-art sparse GP approximations, the rBCM is conceptually simple and does not rely on inducing or variational parameters. The key idea is to recursively distribute computations to independent computational units and, subsequently, recombine them to form an overall result. Efficient closed-form inference allows for straightforward parallelisation and distributed computations with a small memory footprint. The rBCM is independent of the computational graph and can be used on heterogeneous computing infrastructures, ranging from laptops to clusters. With sufficient computing resources our distributed GP model can handle arbitrarily large data sets."}
{"text": "The labeled stochastic block model is a random graph model representing networks with community structure and interactions of multiple types. In its simplest form, it consists of two communities of approximately equal size, and the edges are drawn and labeled at random with probability depending on whether their two endpoints belong to the same community or not.   It has been conjectured in \\cite{Heimlicher12} that correlated reconstruction (i.e.\\ identification of a partition correlated with the true partition into the underlying communities) would be feasible if and only if a model parameter exceeds a threshold. We prove one half of this conjecture, i.e., reconstruction is impossible when below the threshold. In the positive direction, we introduce a weighted graph to exploit the label information. With a suitable choice of weight function, we show that when above the threshold by a specific constant, reconstruction is achieved by (1) minimum bisection, (2) a semidefinite relaxation of minimum bisection, and (3) a spectral method combined with removal of edges incident to vertices of high degree. Furthermore, we show that hypothesis testing between the labeled stochastic block model and the labeled Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph model exhibits a phase transition at the conjectured reconstruction threshold."}
{"text": "For the challenging task of modeling multivariate time series, we propose a new class of models that use dependent Mat\\'ern processes to capture the underlying structure of data, explain their interdependencies, and predict their unknown values. Although similar models have been proposed in the econometric, statistics, and machine learning literature, our approach has several advantages that distinguish it from existing methods: 1) it is flexible to provide high prediction accuracy, yet its complexity is controlled to avoid overfitting; 2) its interpretability separates it from black-box methods; 3) finally, its computational efficiency makes it scalable for high-dimensional time series. In this paper, we use several simulated and real data sets to illustrate these advantages. We will also briefly discuss some extensions of our model."}
{"text": "Reciprocating interactions represent a central feature of all human exchanges. They have been the target of various recent experiments, with healthy participants and psychiatric populations engaging as dyads in multi-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behaviour in such exchanges involves complexities related to each agent's preference for equity with their partner, beliefs about the partner's appetite for equity, beliefs about the partner's model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise account of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what underlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various complexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert observations of behavioural choices. We use generated behaviour to elucidate the richness and sophistication of interactive inference."}
{"text": "We present a novel algorithm, Westfall-Young light, for detecting patterns, such as itemsets and subgraphs, which are statistically significantly enriched in one of two classes. Our method corrects rigorously for multiple hypothesis testing and correlations between patterns through the Westfall-Young permutation procedure, which empirically estimates the null distribution of pattern frequencies in each class via permutations. In our experiments, Westfall-Young light dramatically outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach in terms of both runtime and memory efficiency on popular real-world benchmark datasets for pattern mining. The key to this efficiency is that unlike all existing methods, our algorithm neither needs to solve the underlying frequent itemset mining problem anew for each permutation nor needs to store the occurrence list of all frequent patterns. Westfall-Young light opens the door to significant pattern mining on large datasets that previously led to prohibitive runtime or memory costs."}
{"text": "We introduce and develop a novel approach to outlier detection based on adaptation of random subspace learning. Our proposed method handles both high-dimension low-sample size and traditional low-dimensional high-sample size datasets. Essentially, we avoid the computational bottleneck of techniques like minimum covariance determinant (MCD) by computing the needed determinants and associated measures in much lower dimensional subspaces. Both theoretical and computational development of our approach reveal that it is computationally more efficient than the regularized methods in high-dimensional low-sample size, and often competes favorably with existing methods as far as the percentage of correct outlier detection is concerned."}
{"text": "Given a set of pairwise comparisons, the classical ranking problem computes a single ranking that best represents the preferences of all users. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring individual preferences, arising in the context of making personalized recommendations. In particular, we assume that there are $n$ users of $r$ types; users of the same type provide similar pairwise comparisons for $m$ items according to the Bradley-Terry model. We propose an efficient algorithm that accurately estimates the individual preferences for almost all users, if there are $r \\max \\{m, n\\}\\log m \\log^2 n$ pairwise comparisons per type, which is near optimal in sample complexity when $r$ only grows logarithmically with $m$ or $n$. Our algorithm has three steps: first, for each user, compute the \\emph{net-win} vector which is a projection of its $\\binom{m}{2}$-dimensional vector of pairwise comparisons onto an $m$-dimensional linear subspace; second, cluster the users based on the net-win vectors; third, estimate a single preference for each cluster separately. The net-win vectors are much less noisy than the high dimensional vectors of pairwise comparisons and clustering is more accurate after the projection as confirmed by numerical experiments. Moreover, we show that, when a cluster is only approximately correct, the maximum likelihood estimation for the Bradley-Terry model is still close to the true preference."}
{"text": "Unknown constraints arise in many types of expensive black-box optimization problems. Several methods have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian optimization with constraints, based on the expected improvement (EI) heuristic. However, EI can lead to pathologies when used with constraints. For example, in the case of decoupled constraints---i.e., when one can independently evaluate the objective or the constraints---EI can encounter a pathology that prevents exploration. Additionally, computing EI requires a current best solution, which may not exist if none of the data collected so far satisfy the constraints. By contrast, information-based approaches do not suffer from these failure modes. In this paper, we present a new information-based method called Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). We analyze the performance of PESC and show that it compares favorably to EI-based approaches on synthetic and benchmark problems, as well as several real-world examples. We demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization."}
{"text": "Annealed importance sampling (AIS) is a common algorithm to estimate partition functions of useful stochastic models. One important problem for obtaining accurate AIS estimates is the selection of an annealing schedule. Conventionally, an annealing schedule is often determined heuristically or is simply set as a linearly increasing sequence. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the optimal schedule by deriving a functional that dominates the AIS estimation error and by numerically minimizing this functional. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed algorithm mostly outperforms conventional scheduling schemes with large quantization numbers."}
{"text": "Large multilayer neural networks trained with backpropagation have recently achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of problems. However, using backprop for neural net learning still has some disadvantages, e.g., having to tune a large number of hyperparameters to the data, lack of calibrated probabilistic predictions, and a tendency to overfit the training data. In principle, the Bayesian approach to learning neural networks does not have these problems. However, existing Bayesian techniques lack scalability to large dataset and network sizes. In this work we present a novel scalable method for learning Bayesian neural networks, called probabilistic backpropagation (PBP). Similar to classical backpropagation, PBP works by computing a forward propagation of probabilities through the network and then doing a backward computation of gradients. A series of experiments on ten real-world datasets show that PBP is significantly faster than other techniques, while offering competitive predictive abilities. Our experiments also show that PBP provides accurate estimates of the posterior variance on the network weights."}
{"text": "Bayesian optimization is an effective methodology for the global optimization of functions with expensive evaluations. It relies on querying a distribution over functions defined by a relatively cheap surrogate model. An accurate model for this distribution over functions is critical to the effectiveness of the approach, and is typically fit using Gaussian processes (GPs). However, since GPs scale cubically with the number of observations, it has been challenging to handle objectives whose optimization requires many evaluations, and as such, massively parallelizing the optimization.   In this work, we explore the use of neural networks as an alternative to GPs to model distributions over functions. We show that performing adaptive basis function regression with a neural network as the parametric form performs competitively with state-of-the-art GP-based approaches, but scales linearly with the number of data rather than cubically. This allows us to achieve a previously intractable degree of parallelism, which we apply to large scale hyperparameter optimization, rapidly finding competitive models on benchmark object recognition tasks using convolutional networks, and image caption generation using neural language models."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under an exact rank constraint on the true underlying matrix $M^*$. Instead of observing a subset of the noisy continuous-valued entries of a matrix $M^*$, we observe a subset of noisy 1-bit (or binary) measurements generated according to a probabilistic model. We consider constrained maximum likelihood estimation of $M^*$, under a constraint on the entry-wise infinity-norm of $M^*$ and an exact rank constraint. This is in contrast to previous work which has used convex relaxations for the rank. We provide an upper bound on the matrix estimation error under this model. Compared to the existing results, our bound has faster convergence rate with matrix dimensions when the fraction of revealed 1-bit observations is fixed, independent of the matrix dimensions. We also propose an iterative algorithm for solving our nonconvex optimization with a certificate of global optimality of the limiting point. This algorithm is based on low rank factorization of $M^*$. We validate the method on synthetic and real data with improved performance over existing methods."}
{"text": "In this paper, we examine the problem of approximating a general linear dimensionality reduction (LDR) operator, represented as a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ with $m < n$, by a partial circulant matrix with rows related by circular shifts. Partial circulant matrices admit fast implementations via Fourier transform methods and subsampling operations; our investigation here is motivated by a desire to leverage these potential computational improvements in large-scale data processing tasks. We establish a fundamental result, that most large LDR matrices (whose row spaces are uniformly distributed) in fact cannot be well approximated by partial circulant matrices. Then, we propose a natural generalization of the partial circulant approximation framework that entails approximating the range space of a given LDR operator $A$ over a restricted domain of inputs, using a matrix formed as a product of a partial circulant matrix having $m '> m$ rows and a $m \\times k$ 'post processing' matrix. We introduce a novel algorithmic technique, based on sparse matrix factorization, for identifying the factors comprising such approximations, and provide preliminary evidence to demonstrate the potential of this approach."}

{"text": "We consider the problem of multivariate regression in a setting where the relevant predictors could be shared among different responses. We propose an algorithm which decomposes the coefficient matrix into the product of a long matrix and a wide matrix, with an elastic net penalty on the former and an $\\ell_1$ penalty on the latter. The first matrix linearly transforms the predictors to a set of latent factors, and the second one regresses the responses on these factors. Our algorithm simultaneously performs dimension reduction and coefficient estimation and automatically estimates the number of latent factors from the data. Our formulation results in a non-convex optimization problem, which despite its flexibility to impose effective low-dimensional structure, is difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly in a reasonable time. We specify an optimization algorithm based on alternating minimization with three different sets of updates to solve this non-convex problem and provide theoretical results on its convergence and optimality. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via experiments on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "This paper considers the problem of matrix completion when the observed entries are noisy and contain outliers. It begins with introducing a new optimization criterion for which the recovered matrix is defined as its solution. This criterion uses the celebrated Huber function from the robust statistics literature to downweigh the effects of outliers. A practical algorithm is developed to solve the optimization involved. This algorithm is fast, straightforward to implement, and monotonic convergent. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is theoretically shown to be stable in a well defined sense. Its promising empirical performance is demonstrated via a sequence of simulation experiments, including image inpainting."}
{"text": "Many high dimensional sparse learning problems are formulated as nonconvex optimization. A popular approach to solve these nonconvex optimization problems is through convex relaxations such as linear and semidefinite programming. In this paper, we study the statistical limits of convex relaxations. Particularly, we consider two problems: Mean estimation for sparse principal submatrix and edge probability estimation for stochastic block model. We exploit the sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy to sharply characterize the limits of a broad class of convex relaxations. Our result shows statistical optimality needs to be compromised for achieving computational tractability using convex relaxations. Compared with existing results on computational lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection, our theory focuses on a broad class of convex relaxations and does not rely on unproven hypotheses."}
{"text": "We introduce local expectation gradients which is a general purpose stochastic variational inference algorithm for constructing stochastic gradients through sampling from the variational distribution. This algorithm divides the problem of estimating the stochastic gradients over multiple variational parameters into smaller sub-tasks so that each sub-task exploits intelligently the information coming from the most relevant part of the variational distribution. This is achieved by performing an exact expectation over the single random variable that mostly correlates with the variational parameter of interest resulting in a Rao-Blackwellized estimate that has low variance and can work efficiently for both continuous and discrete random variables. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has interesting similarities with Gibbs sampling but at the same time, unlike Gibbs sampling, it can be trivially parallelized."}
{"text": "Multivariate categorical data occur in many applications of machine learning. One of the main difficulties with these vectors of categorical variables is sparsity. The number of possible observations grows exponentially with vector length, but dataset diversity might be poor in comparison. Recent models have gained significant improvement in supervised tasks with this data. These models embed observations in a continuous space to capture similarities between them. Building on these ideas we propose a Bayesian model for the unsupervised task of distribution estimation of multivariate categorical data. We model vectors of categorical variables as generated from a non-linear transformation of a continuous latent space. Non-linearity captures multi-modality in the distribution. The continuous representation addresses sparsity. Our model ties together many existing models, linking the linear categorical latent Gaussian model, the Gaussian process latent variable model, and Gaussian process classification. We derive inference for our model based on recent developments in sampling based variational inference. We show empirically that the model outperforms its linear and discrete counterparts in imputation tasks of sparse data."}
{"text": "Standard sparse pseudo-input approximations to the Gaussian process (GP) cannot handle complex functions well. Sparse spectrum alternatives attempt to answer this but are known to over-fit. We suggest the use of variational inference for the sparse spectrum approximation to avoid both issues. We model the covariance function with a finite Fourier series approximation and treat it as a random variable. The random covariance function has a posterior, on which a variational distribution is placed. The variational distribution transforms the random covariance function to fit the data. We study the properties of our approximate inference, compare it to alternative ones, and extend it to the distributed and stochastic domains. Our approximation captures complex functions better than standard approaches and avoids over-fitting."}
{"text": "In high dimensions we propose and analyze an aggregation estimator of the precision matrix for Gaussian graphical models. This estimator, called graphical Exponential Screening (gES), linearly combines a suitable set of individual estimators with different underlying graphs, and balances the estimation error and sparsity. We study the risk of this aggregation estimator and show that it is comparable to that of the best estimator based on a single graph, chosen by an oracle. Numerical performance of our method is investigated using both simulated and real datasets, in comparison with some state-of-art estimation procedures."}
{"text": "We are concerned with obtaining novel concentration inequalities for the missing mass, i.e. the total probability mass of the outcomes not observed in the sample. We not only derive - for the first time - distribution-free Bernstein-like deviation bounds with sublinear exponents in deviation size for missing mass, but also improve the results of McAllester and Ortiz (2003) andBerend and Kontorovich (2013, 2012) for small deviations which is the most interesting case in learning theory. It is known that the majority of standard inequalities cannot be directly used to analyze heterogeneous sums i.e. sums whose terms have large difference in magnitude. Our generic and intuitive approach shows that the heterogeneity issue introduced in McAllester and Ortiz (2003) is resolvable at least in the case of missing mass via regulating the terms using our novel thresholding technique."}
{"text": "Structured sparsity has recently emerged in statistics, machine learning and signal processing as a promising paradigm for learning in high-dimensional settings. All existing methods for learning under the assumption of structured sparsity rely on prior knowledge on how to weight (or how to penalize) individual subsets of variables during the subset selection process, which is not available in general. Inferring group weights from data is a key open research problem in structured sparsity.In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of group weight learning. We model the group weights as hyperparameters of heavy-tailed priors on groups of variables and derive an approximate inference scheme to infer these hyperparameters. We empirically show that we are able to recover the model hyperparameters when the data are generated from the model, and we demonstrate the utility of learning weights in synthetic and real denoising problems."}
{"text": "Estimation of response functions is an important task in dynamic medical imaging. This task arises for example in dynamic renal scintigraphy, where impulse response or retention functions are estimated, or in functional magnetic resonance imaging where hemodynamic response functions are required. These functions can not be observed directly and their estimation is complicated because the recorded images are subject to superposition of underlying signals. Therefore, the response functions are estimated via blind source separation and deconvolution. Performance of this algorithm heavily depends on the used models of the response functions. Response functions in real image sequences are rather complicated and finding a suitable parametric form is problematic. In this paper, we study estimation of the response functions using non-parametric Bayesian priors. These priors were designed to favor desirable properties of the functions, such as sparsity or smoothness. These assumptions are used within hierarchical priors of the blind source separation and deconvolution algorithm. Comparison of the resulting algorithms with these priors is performed on synthetic dataset as well as on real datasets from dynamic renal scintigraphy. It is shown that flexible non-parametric priors improve estimation of response functions in both cases. MATLAB implementation of the resulting algorithms is freely available for download."}
{"text": "Novel concentration inequalities are obtained for the missing mass, i.e. the total probability mass of the outcomes not observed in the sample. We derive distribution-free deviation bounds with sublinear exponents in deviation size for missing mass and improve the results of Berend and Kontorovich (2013) and Yari Saeed Khanloo and Haffari (2015) for small deviations which is the most important case in learning theory."}
{"text": "Multi-output Gaussian processes have received increasing attention during the last few years as a natural mechanism to extend the powerful flexibility of Gaussian processes to the setup of multiple output variables. The key point here is the ability to design kernel functions that allow exploiting the correlations between the outputs while fulfilling the positive definiteness requisite for the covariance function. Alternatives to construct these covariance functions are the linear model of coregionalization and process convolutions. Each of these methods demand the specification of the number of latent Gaussian process used to build the covariance function for the outputs. We propose in this paper, the use of an Indian Buffet process as a way to perform model selection over the number of latent Gaussian processes. This type of model is particularly important in the context of latent force models, where the latent forces are associated to physical quantities like protein profiles or latent forces in mechanical systems. We use variational inference to estimate posterior distributions over the variables involved, and show examples of the model performance over artificial data, a motion capture dataset, and a gene expression dataset."}
{"text": "Low-rank representation~(LRR) has been a significant method for segmenting data that are generated from a union of subspaces. It is, however, known that solving the LRR program is challenging in terms of time complexity and memory footprint, in that the size of the nuclear norm regularized matrix is $n$-by-$n$ (where $n$ is the number of samples). In this paper, we thereby develop a fast online implementation of LRR that reduces the memory cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(pd)$, with $p$ being the ambient dimension and $d$ being some estimated rank~($d < p \\ll n$). The crux for this end is a non-convex reformulation of the LRR program, which pursues the basis dictionary that generates the (uncorrupted) observations. We build the theoretical guarantee that the sequence of the solutions produced by our algorithm converges to a stationary point of the empirical and the expected loss function asymptotically. Extensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets further substantiate that our algorithm is fast, robust and memory efficient."}
{"text": "Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) are likelihood-free Monte Carlo methods. ABC methods use a comparison between simulated data, using different parameters drew from a prior distribution, and observed data. This comparison process is based on computing a distance between the summary statistics from the simulated data and the observed data. For complex models, it is usually difficult to define a methodology for choosing or constructing the summary statistics. Recently, a nonparametric ABC has been proposed, that uses a dissimilarity measure between discrete distributions based on empirical kernel embeddings as an alternative for summary statistics. The nonparametric ABC outperforms other methods including ABC, kernel ABC or synthetic likelihood ABC. However, it assumes that the probability distributions are discrete, and it is not robust when dealing with few observations. In this paper, we propose to apply kernel embeddings using an smoother density estimator or Parzen estimator for comparing the empirical data distributions, and computing the ABC posterior. Synthetic data and real data were used to test the Bayesian inference of our method. We compare our method with respect to state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate that our method is a robust estimator of the posterior distribution in terms of the number of observations."}
{"text": "We learn the structure of a Markov Network between two groups of random variables from joint observations. Since modelling and learning the full MN structure may be hard, learning the links between two groups directly may be a preferable option. We introduce a novel concept called the \\emph{partitioned ratio} whose factorization directly associates with the Markovian properties of random variables across two groups. A simple one-shot convex optimization procedure is proposed for learning the \\emph{sparse} factorizations of the partitioned ratio and it is theoretically guaranteed to recover the correct inter-group structure under mild conditions. The performance of the proposed method is experimentally compared with the state of the art MN structure learning methods using ROC curves. Real applications on analyzing bipartisanship in US congress and pairwise DNA/time-series alignments are also reported."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of embedding unweighted, directed k-nearest neighbor graphs in low-dimensional Euclidean space. The k-nearest neighbors of each vertex provides ordinal information on the distances between points, but not the distances themselves. We use this ordinal information along with the low-dimensionality to recover the coordinates of the points up to arbitrary similarity transformations (rigid transformations and scaling). Furthermore, we also illustrate the possibility of robustly recovering the underlying density via the Total Variation Maximum Penalized Likelihood Estimation (TV-MPLE) method. We make existing approaches scalable by using an instance of a local-to-global algorithm based on group synchronization, recently proposed in the literature in the context of sensor network localization and structural biology, which we augment with a scaling synchronization step. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach on large graphs, and show how it compares to the Local Ordinal Embedding (LOE) algorithm, which was recently proposed for recovering the configuration of a cloud of points from pairwise ordinal comparisons between a sparse set of distances."}
{"text": "We present a new approach to estimating the interdependence of industries in an economy by applying data science solutions. By exploiting interfirm buyer--seller network data, we show that the problem of estimating the interdependence of industries is similar to the problem of uncovering the latent block structure in network science literature. To estimate the underlying structure with greater accuracy, we propose an extension of the sparse block model that incorporates node textual information and an unbounded number of industries and interactions among them. The latter task is accomplished by extending the well-known Chinese restaurant process to two dimensions. Inference is based on collapsed Gibbs sampling, and the model is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that the proposed model improves in predictive accuracy and successfully provides a satisfactory solution to the motivated problem. We also discuss issues that affect the future performance of this approach."}
{"text": "We consider the inference of the structure of an undirected graphical model in an exact Bayesian framework. More specifically we aim at achieving the inference with close-form posteriors, avoiding any sampling step. This task would be intractable without any restriction on the considered graphs, so we limit our exploration to mixtures of spanning trees. We consider the inference of the structure of an undirected graphical model in a Bayesian framework. To avoid convergence issues and highly demanding Monte Carlo sampling, we focus on exact inference. More specifically we aim at achieving the inference with close-form posteriors, avoiding any sampling step. To this aim, we restrict the set of considered graphs to mixtures of spanning trees. We investigate under which conditions on the priors - on both tree structures and parameters - exact Bayesian inference can be achieved. Under these conditions, we derive a fast an exact algorithm to compute the posterior probability for an edge to belong to {the tree model} using an algebraic result called the Matrix-Tree theorem. We show that the assumption we have made does not prevent our approach to perform well on synthetic and flow cytometry data."}
{"text": "Brain decoding involves the determination of a subject's cognitive state or an associated stimulus from functional neuroimaging data measuring brain activity. In this setting the cognitive state is typically characterized by an element of a finite set, and the neuroimaging data comprise voluminous amounts of spatiotemporal data measuring some aspect of the neural signal. The associated statistical problem is one of classification from high-dimensional data. We explore the use of functional principal component analysis, mutual information networks, and persistent homology for examining the data through exploratory analysis and for constructing features characterizing the neural signal for brain decoding. We review each approach from this perspective, and we incorporate the features into a classifier based on symmetric multinomial logistic regression with elastic net regularization. The approaches are illustrated in an application where the task is to infer, from brain activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG), the type of video stimulus shown to a subject."}
{"text": "Acyclic digraphs are the underlying representation of Bayesian networks, a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models. Learning the underlying graph from data is a way of gaining insights about the structural properties of a domain. Structure learning forms one of the inference challenges of statistical graphical models.   MCMC methods, notably structure MCMC, to sample graphs from the posterior distribution given the data are probably the only viable option for Bayesian model averaging. Score modularity and restrictions on the number of parents of each node allow the graphs to be grouped into larger collections, which can be scored as a whole to improve the chain's convergence. Current examples of algorithms taking advantage of grouping are the biased order MCMC, which acts on the alternative space of permuted triangular matrices, and non ergodic edge reversal moves.   Here we propose a novel algorithm, which employs the underlying combinatorial structure of DAGs to define a new grouping. As a result convergence is improved compared to structure MCMC, while still retaining the property of producing an unbiased sample. Finally the method can be combined with edge reversal moves to improve the sampler further."}
{"text": "In the presence of weak overall correlation, it may be useful to investigate if the correlation is significantly and substantially more pronounced over a subpopulation. Two different testing procedures are compared. Both are based on the rankings of the values of two variables from a data set with a large number n of observations. The first maintains its level against Gaussian copulas; the second adapts to general alternatives in the sense that that the number of parameters used in the test grows with n. An analysis of wine quality illustrates how the methods detect heterogeneity of association between chemical properties of the wine, which are attributable to a mix of different cultivars."}
{"text": "We consider two connected aspects of maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter for high-dimensional discrete graphical models: the existence of the maximum likelihood estimate (mle) and its computation.   When the data is sparse, there are many zeros in the contingency table and the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter may not exist. Fienberg and Rinaldo (2012) have shown that the mle does not exists iff the data vector belongs to a face of the so-called marginal cone spanned by the rows of the design matrix of the model. Identifying these faces in high-dimension is challenging. In this paper, we take a local approach : we show that one such face, albeit possibly not the smallest one, can be identified by looking at a collection of marginal graphical models generated by induced subgraphs $G_i,i=1,\\ldots,k$ of $G$. This is our first contribution.   Our second contribution concerns the composite maximum likelihood estimate. When the dimension of the problem is large, estimating the parameters of a given graphical model through maximum likelihood is challenging, if not impossible. The traditional approach to this problem has been local with the use of composite likelihood based on local conditional likelihoods.   A more recent development is to have the components of the composite likelihood be marginal likelihoods centred around each $v$. We first show that the estimates obtained by consensus through local conditional and marginal likelihoods are identical. We then study the asymptotic properties of the composite maximum likelihood estimate when both the dimension of the model and the sample size $N$ go to infinity."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimating undirected triangle-free graphs of high dimensional distributions. Triangle-free graphs form a rich graph family which allows arbitrary loopy structures but 3-cliques. For inferential tractability, we propose a graphical Fermat's principle to regularize the distribution family. Such principle enforces the existence of a distribution-dependent pseudo-metric such that any two nodes have a smaller distance than that of two other nodes who have a geodesic path include these two nodes. Guided by this principle, we show that a greedy strategy is able to recover the true graph. The resulting algorithm only requires a pairwise distance matrix as input and is computationally even more efficient than calculating the minimum spanning tree. We consider graph estimation problems under different settings, including discrete and nonparametric distribution families. Thorough numerical results are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "The main contribution of this article is a new prior distribution over directed acyclic graphs, which gives larger weight to sparse graphs. This distribution is intended for structured Bayesian networks, where the structure is given by an ordered block model. That is, the nodes of the graph are objects which fall into categories (or blocks); the blocks have a natural ordering. The presence of a relationship between two objects is denoted by an arrow, from the object of lower category to the object of higher category. The models considered here were introduced in Kemp et al. (2004) for relational data and extended to multivariate data in Mansinghka et al. (2006). The prior over graph structures presented here has an explicit formula. The number of nodes in each layer of the graph follow a Hoppe Ewens urn model.   We consider the situation where the nodes of the graph represent random variables, whose joint probability distribution factorises along the DAG. We describe Monte Carlo schemes for finding the optimal aposteriori structure given a data matrix and compare the performance with Mansinghka et al. (2006) and also with the uniform prior."}
{"text": "The variational framework for learning inducing variables (Titsias, 2009a) has had a large impact on the Gaussian process literature. The framework may be interpreted as minimizing a rigorously defined Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and posterior processes. To our knowledge this connection has thus far gone unremarked in the literature. In this paper we give a substantial generalization of the literature on this topic. We give a new proof of the result for infinite index sets which allows inducing points that are not data points and likelihoods that depend on all function values. We then discuss augmented index sets and show that, contrary to previous works, marginal consistency of augmentation is not enough to guarantee consistency of variational inference with the original model. We then characterize an extra condition where such a guarantee is obtainable. Finally we show how our framework sheds light on interdomain sparse approximations and sparse approximations for Cox processes."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of discriminative factor analysis for data that are in general non-Gaussian. A Bayesian model based on the ranks of the data is proposed. We first introduce a new {\\em max-margin} version of the rank-likelihood. A discriminative factor model is then developed, integrating the max-margin rank-likelihood and (linear) Bayesian support vector machines, which are also built on the max-margin principle. The discriminative factor model is further extended to the {\\em nonlinear} case through mixtures of local linear classifiers, via Dirichlet processes. Fully local conjugacy of the model yields efficient inference with both Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes approaches. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real data demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model and its potential for applications in computational biology."}
{"text": "Infinite Hidden Markov Models (iHMM's) are an attractive, nonparametric generalization of the classical Hidden Markov Model which can automatically infer the number of hidden states in the system. However, due to the infinite-dimensional nature of transition dynamics performing inference in the iHMM is difficult. In this paper, we present an infinite-state Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm to resample state trajectories for the iHMM. The proposed algorithm uses an efficient proposal optimized for iHMMs and leverages ancestor sampling to suppress degeneracy of the standard PG algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates significant convergence improvements on synthetic and real world data sets. Additionally, the infinite-state PG algorithm has linear-time complexity in the number of states in the sampler, while competing methods scale quadratically."}
{"text": "In modern scientific research, massive datasets with huge numbers of observations are frequently encountered. To facilitate the computational process, a divide-and-conquer scheme is often used for the analysis of big data. In such a strategy, a full dataset is first split into several manageable segments; the final output is then averaged from the individual outputs of the segments. Despite its popularity in practice, it remains largely unknown that whether such a distributive strategy provides valid theoretical inferences to the original data. In this paper, we address this fundamental issue for the distributed kernel regression (DKR), where the algorithmic feasibility is measured by the generalization performance of the resulting estimator. To justify DKR, a uniform convergence rate is needed for bounding the generalization error over the individual outputs, which brings new and challenging issues in the big data setup. Under mild conditions, we show that, with a proper number of segments, DKR leads to an estimator that is generalization consistent to the unknown regression function. The obtained results justify the method of DKR and shed light on the feasibility of using other distributed algorithms for processing big data. The promising preference of the method is supported by both simulation and real data examples."}
{"text": "Hypergraph partitioning lies at the heart of a number of problems in machine learning and network sciences. Many algorithms for hypergraph partitioning have been proposed that extend standard approaches for graph partitioning to the case of hypergraphs. However, theoretical aspects of such methods have seldom received attention in the literature as compared to the extensive studies on the guarantees of graph partitioning. For instance, consistency results of spectral graph partitioning under the stochastic block model are well known. In this paper, we present a planted partition model for sparse random non-uniform hypergraphs that generalizes the stochastic block model. We derive an error bound for a spectral hypergraph partitioning algorithm under this model using matrix concentration inequalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first consistency result related to partitioning non-uniform hypergraphs."}
{"text": "We address the problem of synthetic gene design using Bayesian optimization. The main issue when designing a gene is that the design space is defined in terms of long strings of characters of different lengths, which renders the optimization intractable. We propose a three-step approach to deal with this issue. First, we use a Gaussian process model to emulate the behavior of the cell. As inputs of the model, we use a set of biologically meaningful gene features, which allows us to define optimal gene designs rules. Based on the model outputs we define a multi-task acquisition function to optimize simultaneously severals aspects of interest. Finally, we define an evaluation function, which allow us to rank sets of candidate gene sequences that are coherent with the optimal design strategy. We illustrate the performance of this approach in a real gene design experiment with mammalian cells."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel approach for estimating Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) parameters from collapsed Gibbs samples (CGS), by leveraging the full conditional distributions over the latent variable assignments to efficiently average over multiple samples, for little more computational cost than drawing a single additional collapsed Gibbs sample. Our approach can be understood as adapting the soft clustering methodology of Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB0) to CGS parameter estimation, in order to get the best of both techniques. Our estimators can straightforwardly be applied to the output of any existing implementation of CGS, including modern accelerated variants. We perform extensive empirical comparisons of our estimators with those of standard collapsed inference algorithms on real-world data for both unsupervised LDA and Prior-LDA, a supervised variant of LDA for multi-label classification. Our results show a consistent advantage of our approach over traditional CGS under all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 inference in the majority of conditions. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of averaging over multiple samples in LDA parameter estimation, and the use of efficient computational techniques to do so."}
{"text": "In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvector of the unnormalized modularity matrix and the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix is developed. Based on this analysis a method to approximate the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix is given, and the relative error of the approximation is derived. A complete proof of the equivalence between normalized modularity clustering and normalized adjacency clustering is also given. Some applications and experiments are given to illustrate and corroborate the points that are made in the theoretical development."}
{"text": "A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how activity in the nervous system is related to features of the external world, or to features of the nervous system itself. A common approach is to model neural responses as a weighted combination of external features, or vice versa. The structure of the model weights can provide insight into neural representations. Often, neural input-output relationships are sparse, with only a few inputs contributing to the output. In part to account for such sparsity, structured regularizers are incorporated into model fitting optimization. However, by imposing priors, structured regularizers can make it difficult to interpret learned model parameters. Here, we investigate a simple, minimally structured model estimation method for accurate, unbiased estimation of sparse models based on Bootstrapped Adaptive Threshold Selection followed by ordinary least-squares refitting (BoATS). Through extensive numerical investigations, we show that this method often performs favorably compared to L1 and L2 regularizers. In particular, for a variety of model distributions and noise levels, BoATS more accurately recovers the parameters of sparse models, leading to more parsimonious explanations of outputs. Finally, we apply this method to the task of decoding human speech production from ECoG recordings."}
{"text": "We study the theoretical properties of learning a dictionary from $N$ signals $\\mathbf x_i\\in \\mathbb R^K$ for $i=1,...,N$ via $l_1$-minimization. We assume that $\\mathbf x_i$'s are $i.i.d.$ random linear combinations of the $K$ columns from a complete (i.e., square and invertible) reference dictionary $\\mathbf D_0 \\in \\mathbb R^{K\\times K}$. Here, the random linear coefficients are generated from either the $s$-sparse Gaussian model or the Bernoulli-Gaussian model. First, for the population case, we establish a sufficient and almost necessary condition for the reference dictionary $\\mathbf D_0$ to be locally identifiable, i.e., a local minimum of the expected $l_1$-norm objective function. Our condition covers both sparse and dense cases of the random linear coefficients and significantly improves the sufficient condition by Gribonval and Schnass (2010). In addition, we show that for a complete $\\mu$-coherent reference dictionary, i.e., a dictionary with absolute pairwise column inner-product at most $\\mu\\in[0,1)$, local identifiability holds even when the random linear coefficient vector has up to $O(\\mu^{-2})$ nonzeros on average. Moreover, our local identifiability results also translate to the finite sample case with high probability provided that the number of signals $N$ scales as $O(K\\log K)$."}
{"text": "In a range of fields including the geosciences, molecular biology, robotics and computer vision, one encounters problems that involve random variables on manifolds. Currently, there is a lack of flexible probabilistic models on manifolds that are fast and easy to train. We define an extremely flexible class of exponential family distributions on manifolds such as the torus, sphere, and rotation groups, and show that for these distributions the gradient of the log-likelihood can be computed efficiently using a non-commutative generalization of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We discuss applications to Bayesian camera motion estimation (where harmonic exponential families serve as conjugate priors), and modelling of the spatial distribution of earthquakes on the surface of the earth. Our experimental results show that harmonic densities yield a significantly higher likelihood than the best competing method, while being orders of magnitude faster to train."}
{"text": "We present a unified framework for low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties. We first prove that the proposed estimator attains a faster statistical rate than the traditional low-rank matrix estimator with nuclear norm penalty. Moreover, we rigorously show that under a certain condition on the magnitude of the nonzero singular values, the proposed estimator enjoys oracle property (i.e., exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix), besides attaining a faster rate. As far as we know, this is the first work that establishes the theory of low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties, confirming the advantages of nonconvex penalties for matrix completion. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "We present Vector-Space Markov Random Fields (VS-MRFs), a novel class of undirected graphical models where each variable can belong to an arbitrary vector space. VS-MRFs generalize a recent line of work on scalar-valued, uni-parameter exponential family and mixed graphical models, thereby greatly broadening the class of exponential families available (e.g., allowing multinomial and Dirichlet distributions). Specifically, VS-MRFs are the joint graphical model distributions where the node-conditional distributions belong to generic exponential families with general vector space domains. We also present a sparsistent $M$-estimator for learning our class of MRFs that recovers the correct set of edges with high probability. We validate our approach via a set of synthetic data experiments as well as a real-world case study of over four million foods from the popular diet tracking app MyFitnessPal. Our results demonstrate that our algorithm performs well empirically and that VS-MRFs are capable of capturing and highlighting interesting structure in complex, real-world data. All code for our algorithm is open source and publicly available."}
{"text": "We consider statistical and algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. Prior results show that, from an \\emph{algorithmic perspective}, when using sketching matrices constructed from random projections and leverage-score sampling, if the number of samples $r$ much smaller than the original sample size $n$, then the worst-case (WC) error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a very small relative error. From a \\emph{statistical perspective}, one typically considers the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data are generated according to a statistical linear model. In this paper, we provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing, in a unified manner, algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $r$ is much smaller than $n$, while the PE typically requires the number of samples $r$ to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent work show that our upper bounds on PE can not be improved."}
{"text": "We empirically evaluate a stochastic annealing strategy for Bayesian posterior optimization with variational inference. Variational inference is a deterministic approach to approximate posterior inference in Bayesian models in which a typically non-convex objective function is locally optimized over the parameters of the approximating distribution. We investigate an annealing method for optimizing this objective with the aim of finding a better local optimal solution and compare with deterministic annealing methods and no annealing. We show that stochastic annealing can provide clear improvement on the GMM and HMM, while performance on LDA tends to favor deterministic annealing methods."}
{"text": "A recurring problem when building probabilistic latent variable models is regularization and model selection, for instance, the choice of the dimensionality of the latent space. In the context of belief networks with latent variables, this problem has been adressed with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) employing Monte Carlo inference. We present a variational inference approach to ARD for Deep Generative Models using doubly stochastic variational inference to provide fast and scalable learning. We show empirical results on a standard dataset illustrating the effects of contracting the latent space automatically. We show that the resulting latent representations are significantly more compact without loss of expressive power of the learned models."}
{"text": "The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for efficient exploration of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These facilities could be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. E.g. in biological experiments many experimental set ups allow several samples to be simultaneously processed. Batch methods, however, require modeling of the interaction between the evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate a simple heuristic based on an estimate of the Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction (i.e. local repulsion) at negligible computational overhead. The resulting algorithm compares well, in running time, with much more elaborate alternatives. The approach assumes that the function of interest, $f$, is a Lipschitz continuous function. A wrap-loop around the acquisition function is used to collect batches of points of certain size minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The speed-up of our method with respect to previous approaches is significant in a set of computationally expensive experiments."}
{"text": "Models of complex systems are often formalized as sequential software simulators: computationally intensive programs that iteratively build up probable system configurations given parameters and initial conditions. These simulators enable modelers to capture effects that are difficult to characterize analytically or summarize statistically. However, in many real-world applications, these simulations need to be inverted to match the observed data. This typically requires the custom design, derivation and implementation of sophisticated inversion algorithms. Here we give a framework for inverting a broad class of complex software simulators via probabilistic programming and automatic inference, using under 20 lines of probabilistic code. Our approach is based on a formulation of inversion as approximate inference in a simple sequential probabilistic model. We implement four inference strategies, including Metropolis-Hastings, a sequentialized Metropolis-Hastings scheme, and a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, requiring 4 or fewer lines of probabilistic code each. We demonstrate our framework by applying it to invert a real geological software simulator from the oil and gas industry."}
{"text": "This paper examines the use of a residual bootstrap for bias correction in machine learning regression methods. Accounting for bias is an important obstacle in recent efforts to develop statistical inference for machine learning methods. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed bootstrap bias correction can lead to substantial improvements in both bias and predictive accuracy. In the context of ensembles of trees, we show that this correction can be approximated at only double the cost of training the original ensemble without introducing additional variance. Our method is shown to improve test-set accuracy over random forests by up to 70\\% on example problems from the UCI repository."}
{"text": "For large matrix factorisation problems, we develop a distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) that we call Parallel SGLD (PSGLD). PSGLD has very favourable scaling properties with increasing data size and is comparable in terms of computational requirements to optimisation methods based on stochastic gradient descent. PSGLD achieves high performance by exploiting the conditional independence structure of the MF models to sub-sample data in a systematic manner as to allow parallelisation and distributed computation. We provide a convergence proof of the algorithm and verify its superior performance on various architectures such as Graphics Processing Units, shared memory multi-core systems and multi-computer clusters."}
{"text": "We show that a neural network with arbitrary depth and non-linearities, with dropout applied before every weight layer, is mathematically equivalent to an approximation to a well known Bayesian model. This interpretation might offer an explanation to some of dropout's key properties, such as its robustness to over-fitting. Our interpretation allows us to reason about uncertainty in deep learning, and allows the introduction of the Bayesian machinery into existing deep learning frameworks in a principled way.   This document is an appendix for the main paper \"Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning\" by Gal and Ghahramani, 2015."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose a family of tractable kernels that is dense in the family of bounded positive semi-definite functions (i.e. can approximate any bounded kernel with arbitrary precision). We start by discussing the case of stationary kernels, and propose a family of spectral kernels that extends existing approaches such as spectral mixture kernels and sparse spectrum kernels. Our extension has two primary advantages. Firstly, unlike existing spectral approaches that yield infinite differentiability, the kernels we introduce allow learning the degree of differentiability of the latent function in Gaussian process (GP) models and functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in other kernel methods. Secondly, we show that some of the kernels we propose require fewer parameters than existing spectral kernels for the same accuracy, thereby leading to faster and more robust inference. Finally, we generalize our approach and propose a flexible and tractable family of spectral kernels that we prove can approximate any continuous bounded nonstationary kernel."}
{"text": "We introduce a new class of nonstationary kernels, which we derive as covariance functions of a novel family of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs). We construct string GPs to allow for multiple types of local patterns in the data, while ensuring a mild global regularity condition. In this paper, we illustrate the efficacy of the approach using synthetic data and demonstrate that the model outperforms competing approaches on well studied, real-life datasets that exhibit nonstationary features."}
{"text": "It is becoming increasingly important for machine learning methods to make predictions that are interpretable as well as accurate. In many practical applications, it is of interest which features and feature interactions are relevant to the prediction task. We present a novel method, Selective Bayesian Forest Classifier, that strikes a balance between predictive power and interpretability by simultaneously performing classification, feature selection, feature interaction detection and visualization. It builds parsimonious yet flexible models using tree-structured Bayesian networks, and samples an ensemble of such models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We build in feature selection by dividing the trees into two groups according to their relevance to the outcome of interest. Our method performs competitively on classification and feature selection benchmarks in low and high dimensions, and includes a visualization tool that provides insight into relevant features and interactions."}

Convex analysis and optimization over spaces of tensors is now gaining much interest due to its potential applications to signal processing, statistics and engineering.

{"text": "We propose Kernel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (KMC), a gradient-free adaptive MCMC algorithm based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). On target densities where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC adaptively learns the target's gradient structure by fitting an exponential family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free samplers. We support our claims with experimental studies on both toy and real-world applications, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and exact-approximate MCMC."}
{"text": "There is renewed interest in formulating integration as an inference problem, motivated by obtaining a full distribution over numerical error that can be propagated through subsequent computation. Current methods, such as Bayesian Quadrature, demonstrate impressive empirical performance but lack theoretical analysis. An important challenge is to reconcile these probabilistic integrators with rigorous convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present the first probabilistic integrator that admits such theoretical treatment, called Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature (FWBQ). Under FWBQ, convergence to the true value of the integral is shown to be exponential and posterior contraction rates are proven to be superexponential. In simulations, FWBQ is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and out-performs alternatives based on Frank-Wolfe optimisation. Our approach is applied to successfully quantify numerical error in the solution to a challenging model choice problem in cellular biology."}
{"text": "In recent years there has been an increased interest in statistical analysis of data with multiple types of relations among a set of entities. Such multi-relational data can be represented as multi-layer graphs where the set of vertices represents the entities and multiple types of edges represent the different relations among them. For community detection in multi-layer graphs, we consider two random graph models, the multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (MLSBM) and a model with a restricted parameter space, the restricted multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (RMLSBM). We derive consistency results for community assignments of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) in both models where MLSBM is assumed to be the true model, and either the number of nodes or the number of types of edges or both grow. We compare MLEs in the two models with other baseline approaches, such as separate modeling of layers, aggregating the layers and majority voting. RMLSBM is shown to have advantage over MLSBM when either the growth rate of the number of communities is high or the growth rate of the average degree of the component graphs in the multi-graph is low. We also derive minimax rates of error and sharp thresholds for achieving consistency of community detection in both models, which are then used to compare the multi-layer models with a baseline model, the aggregate stochastic block model. The simulation studies and real data applications confirm the superior performance of the multi-layer approaches in comparison to the baseline procedures."}
{"text": "The modern scale of data has brought new challenges to Bayesian inference. In particular, conventional MCMC algorithms are computationally very expensive for large data sets. A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies random partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is distribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales. We provide theoretical justification and extensive experiments illustrating empirical performance."}
{"text": "Corrupting the input and hidden layers of deep neural networks (DNNs) with multiplicative noise, often drawn from the Bernoulli distribution (or 'dropout'), provides regularization that has significantly contributed to deep learning's success. However, understanding how multiplicative corruptions prevent overfitting has been difficult due to the complexity of a DNN's functional form. In this paper, we show that when a Gaussian prior is placed on a DNN's weights, applying multiplicative noise induces a Gaussian scale mixture, which can be reparameterized to circumvent the problematic likelihood function. Analysis can then proceed by using a type-II maximum likelihood procedure to derive a closed-form expression revealing how regularization evolves as a function of the network's weights. Results show that multiplicative noise forces weights to become either sparse or invariant to rescaling. We find our analysis has implications for model compression as it naturally reveals a weight pruning rule that starkly contrasts with the commonly used signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While the SNR prunes weights with large variances, seeing them as noisy, our approach recognizes their robustness and retains them. We empirically demonstrate our approach has a strong advantage over the SNR heuristic and is competitive to retraining with soft targets produced from a teacher model."}
{"text": "Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference. Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). The user only provides a Bayesian model and a dataset; nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan."}
{"text": "Learning of low dimensional structure in multidimensional data is a canonical problem in machine learning. One common approach is to suppose that the observed data are close to a lower-dimensional smooth manifold. There are a rich variety of manifold learning methods available, which allow mapping of data points to the manifold. However, there is a clear lack of probabilistic methods that allow learning of the manifold along with the generative distribution of the observed data. The best attempt is the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), but identifiability issues lead to poor performance. We solve these issues by proposing a novel Coulomb repulsive process (Corp) for locations of points on the manifold, inspired by physical models of electrostatic interactions among particles. Combining this process with a GP prior for the mapping function yields a novel electrostatic GP (electroGP) process. Focusing on the simple case of a one-dimensional manifold, we develop efficient inference algorithms, and illustrate substantially improved performance in a variety of experiments including filling in missing frames in video."}
{"text": "We introduce GAMSEL (Generalized Additive Model Selection), a penalized likelihood approach for fitting sparse generalized additive models in high dimension. Our method interpolates between null, linear and additive models by allowing the effect of each variable to be estimated as being either zero, linear, or a low-complexity curve, as determined by the data. We present a blockwise coordinate descent procedure for efficiently optimizing the penalized likelihood objective over a dense grid of the tuning parameter, producing a regularization path of additive models. We demonstrate the performance of our method on both real and simulated data examples, and compare it with existing techniques for additive model selection."}
{"text": "Over the past years Robust PCA has been established as a standard tool for reliable low-rank approximation of matrices in the presence of outliers. Recently, the Robust PCA approach via nuclear norm minimization has been extended to matrices with linear structures which appear in applications such as system identification and data series analysis. At the same time it has been shown how to control the rank of a structured approximation via matrix factorization approaches. The drawbacks of these methods either lie in the lack of robustness against outliers or in their static nature of repeated batch-processing. We present a Robust Structured Low-Rank Approximation method on the Grassmannian that on the one hand allows for fast re-initialization in an online setting due to subspace identification with manifolds, and that is robust against outliers due to a smooth approximation of the $\\ell_p$-norm cost function on the other hand. The method is evaluated in online time series forecasting tasks on simulated and real-world data."}
{"text": "Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs. Code to replicate each experiment in this paper will be available shortly."}
{"text": "Mean field variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation method due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, it is well known that a major failing of MFVB is that it underestimates the uncertainty of model variables (sometimes severely) and provides no information about model variable covariance.   We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables---both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both simulated and real data."}
{"text": "The latent block model (LBM) is a flexible probabilistic tool to describe interactions between node sets in bipartite networks, but it does not account for interactions of time varying intensity between nodes in unknown classes. In this paper we propose a non stationary temporal extension of the LBM that clusters simultaneously the two node sets of a bipartite network and constructs classes of time intervals on which interactions are stationary. The number of clusters as well as the membership to classes are obtained by maximizing the exact complete-data integrated likelihood relying on a greedy search approach. Experiments on simulated and real data are carried out in order to assess the proposed methodology."}
{"text": "This paper presents a novel spectral algorithm with additive clustering designed to identify overlapping communities in networks. The algorithm is based on geometric properties of the spectrum of the expected adjacency matrix in a random graph model that we call stochastic blockmodel with overlap (SBMO). An adaptive version of the algorithm, that does not require the knowledge of the number of hidden communities, is proved to be consistent under the SBMO when the degrees in the graph are (slightly more than) logarithmic. The algorithm is shown to perform well on simulated data and on real-world graphs with known overlapping communities."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose an online algorithm to compute matrix factorizations. Proposed algorithm updates the dictionary matrix and associated coefficients using a single observation at each time. The algorithm performs low-rank updates to dictionary matrix. We derive the algorithm by defining a simple objective function to minimize whenever an observation is arrived. We extend the algorithm further for handling missing data. We also provide a mini-batch extension which enables to compute the matrix factorization on big datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on a real dataset and give comparisons with well-known algorithms such as stochastic gradient matrix factorization and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)."}
{"text": "We propose a class of nonparametric two-sample tests with a cost linear in the sample size. Two tests are given, both based on an ensemble of distances between analytic functions representing each of the distributions. The first test uses smoothed empirical characteristic functions to represent the distributions, the second uses distribution embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Analyticity implies that differences in the distributions may be detected almost surely at a finite number of randomly chosen locations/frequencies. The new tests are consistent against a larger class of alternatives than the previous linear-time tests based on the (non-smoothed) empirical characteristic functions, while being much faster than the current state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based or energy distance-based tests. Experiments on artificial benchmarks and on challenging real-world testing problems demonstrate that our tests give a better power/time tradeoff than competing approaches, and in some cases, better outright power than even the most expensive quadratic-time tests. This performance advantage is retained even in high dimensions, and in cases where the difference in distributions is not observable with low order statistics."}
{"text": "The statistical dependencies which independent component analysis (ICA) cannot remove often provide rich information beyond the linear independent components. It would thus be very useful to estimate the dependency structure from data. While such models have been proposed, they usually concentrated on higher-order correlations such as energy (square) correlations. Yet, linear correlations are a most fundamental and informative form of dependency in many real data sets. Linear correlations are usually completely removed by ICA and related methods, so they can only be analyzed by developing new methods which explicitly allow for linearly correlated components. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model of linear non-Gaussian components which are allowed to have both linear and energy correlations. The precision matrix of the linear components is assumed to be randomly generated by a higher-order process and explicitly parametrized by a parameter matrix. The estimation of the parameter matrix is shown to be particularly simple because using score matching, the objective function is a quadratic form. Using simulations with artificial data, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves identifiability of non-Gaussian components by simultaneously learning their correlation structure. Applications on simulated complex cells with natural image input, as well as spectrograms of natural audio data show that the method finds new kinds of dependencies between the components."}
{"text": "Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions. For example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children's names in a given state and year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions. In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency between the draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the preceding nucleotides, children's names are highly correlated from year to year, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic. These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here, we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in P\\'olya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead."}
{"text": "Nonparametric extension of tensor regression is proposed. Nonlinearity in a high-dimensional tensor space is broken into simple local functions by incorporating low-rank tensor decomposition. Compared to naive nonparametric approaches, our formulation considerably improves the convergence rate of estimation while maintaining consistency with the same function class under specific conditions. To estimate local functions, we develop a Bayesian estimator with the Gaussian process prior. Experimental results show its theoretical properties and high performance in terms of predicting a summary statistic of a real complex network."}
{"text": "We present a technique for clustering categorical data by generating many dissimilarity matrices and averaging over them. We begin by demonstrating our technique on low dimensional categorical data and comparing it to several other techniques that have been proposed. Then we give conditions under which our method should yield good results in general. Our method extends to high dimensional categorical data of equal lengths by ensembling over many choices of explanatory variables. In this context we compare our method with two other methods. Finally, we extend our method to high dimensional categorical data vectors of unequal length by using alignment techniques to equalize the lengths. We give examples to show that our method continues to provide good results, in particular, better in the context of genome sequences than clusterings suggested by phylogenetic trees."}
{"text": "Given a family of probability measures in P(X), the space of probability measures on a Hilbert space X, our goal in this paper is to highlight one ore more curves in P(X) that summarize efficiently that family. We propose to study this problem under the optimal transport (Wasserstein) geometry, using curves that are restricted to be geodesic segments under that metric. We show that concepts that play a key role in Euclidean PCA, such as data centering or orthogonality of principal directions, find a natural equivalent in the optimal transport geometry, using Wasserstein means and differential geometry. The implementation of these ideas is, however, computationally challenging. To achieve scalable algorithms that can handle thousands of measures, we propose to use a relaxed definition for geodesics and regularized optimal transport distances. The interest of our approach is demonstrated on images seen either as shapes or color histograms."}
{"text": "Factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs) are powerful tools of modeling sequential data. Learning FHMMs yields a challenging simultaneous model selection issue, i.e., selecting the number of multiple Markov chains and the dimensionality of each chain. Our main contribution is to address this model selection issue by extending Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference to FHMMs. First, we offer a better approximation of marginal log-likelihood than the previous FAB inference. Our key idea is to integrate out transition probabilities, yet still apply the Laplace approximation to emission probabilities. Second, we prove that if there are two very similar hidden states in an FHMM, i.e. one is redundant, then FAB will almost surely shrink and eliminate one of them, making the model parsimonious. Experimental results show that FAB for FHMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art nonparametric Bayesian iFHMM and Variational FHMM in model selection accuracy, with competitive held-out perplexity."}
{"text": "Finding statistically significant high-order interaction features in predictive modeling is important but challenging task. The difficulty lies in the fact that, for a recent applications with high-dimensional covariates, the number of possible high-order interaction features would be extremely large. Identifying statistically significant features from such a huge pool of candidates would be highly challenging both in computational and statistical senses. To work with this problem, we consider a two stage algorithm where we first select a set of high-order interaction features by marginal screening, and then make statistical inferences on the regression model fitted only with the selected features. Such statistical inferences are called post-selection inference (PSI), and receiving an increasing attention in the literature. One of the seminal recent advancements in PSI literature is the works by Lee et al. where the authors presented an algorithmic framework for computing exact sampling distributions in PSI. A main challenge when applying their approach to our high-order interaction models is to cope with the fact that PSI in general depends not only on the selected features but also on the unselected features, making it hard to apply to our extremely high-dimensional high-order interaction models. The goal of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by introducing a novel efficient method for PSI. Our key idea is to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction features, and to develop a pruning method of the tree which enables us to quickly identify a group of unselected features that are guaranteed to have no influence on PSI. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method allows us to reliably identify statistically significant high-order interaction features with reasonable computational cost."}
{"text": "Taking into account high-order interactions among covariates is valuable in many practical regression problems. This is, however, computationally challenging task because the number of high-order interaction features to be considered would be extremely large unless the number of covariates is sufficiently small. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient algorithm for LASSO-based sparse learning of such high-order interaction models. Our basic strategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently proposed safe feature screening (SFS) rule. An SFS rule has a property that, if a feature satisfies the rule, then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active in the LASSO solution, meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the LASSO training process. If a large number of features can be screened-out before training the LASSO, the computational cost and the memory requirment can be dramatically reduced. However, applying such an SFS rule to each of the extremely large number of high-order interaction features would be computationally infeasible. Our key idea for solving this computational issue is to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction features. Specifically, we introduce a pruning condition called safe feature pruning (SFP) rule which has a property that, if the rule is satisfied in a certain node of the tree, then all the high-order interaction features corresponding to its descendant nodes can be guaranteed to be non-active at the optimal solution. Our algorithm is extremely efficient, making it possible to work, e.g., with 3rd order interactions of 10,000 original covariates, where the number of possible high-order interaction features is greater than 10^{12}."}
{"text": "Kernel methods are ubiquitous tools in machine learning. However, there is often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori. Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a $N \\times N$ Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of $N$ instances. The computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct application of kernel methods on large datasets, and makes kernel learning especially difficult. In this paper we introduce Bayesian nonparmetric kernel-learning (BaNK), a generic, data-driven framework for scalable learning of kernels. BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral distribution of random frequencies allowing it to both learn kernels and scale to large datasets. We show that this framework can be used for large scale regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that BaNK outperforms several other scalable approaches for kernel learning on a variety of real world datasets."}
{"text": "Factorized Information Criterion (FIC) is a recently developed information criterion, based on which a novel model selection methodology, namely Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) Inference, has been developed and successfully applied to various hierarchical Bayesian models. The Dirichlet Process (DP) prior, and one of its well known representations, the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), derive another line of model selection methods. FIC can be viewed as a prior distribution over the latent variable configurations. Under this view, we prove that when the parameter dimensionality $D_{c}=2$, FIC is equivalent to CRP. We argue that when $D_{c}>2$, FIC avoids an inherent problem of DP/CRP, i.e. the data likelihood will dominate the impact of the prior, and thus the model selection capability will weaken as $D_{c}$ increases. However, FIC overestimates the data likelihood. As a result, FIC may be overly biased towards models with less components. We propose a natural generalization of FIC, which finds a middle ground between CRP and FIC, and may yield more accurate model selection results than FIC."}
{"text": "We study the Gaussian Process regression model in the context of training data with noise in both input and output. The presence of two sources of noise makes the task of learning accurate predictive models extremely challenging. However, in some instances additional constraints may be available that can reduce the uncertainty in the resulting predictive models. In particular, we consider the case of monotonically ordered latent input, which occurs in many application domains that deal with temporal data. We present a novel inference and learning approach based on non-parametric Gaussian variational approximation to learn the GP model while taking into account the new constraints. The resulting strategy allows one to gain access to posterior estimates of both the input and the output and results in improved predictive performance. We compare our proposed models to state-of-the-art Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) and other competing approaches on synthetic and real sea-level rise data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach consistently outperforms selected methods while, at the same time, reducing the computational costs of learning and inference."}
{"text": "A new Bayesian approach to linear system identification has been proposed in a series of recent papers. The main idea is to frame linear system identification as predictor estimation in an infinite dimensional space, with the aid of regularization/Bayesian techniques. This approach guarantees the identification of stable predictors based on the prediction error minimization. Unluckily, the stability of the predictors does not guarantee the stability of the impulse response of the system. In this paper we propose and compare various techniques to address this issue. Simulations results comparing these techniques will be provided."}

{"text": "This paper proposes a novel Gaussian process approach to fault removal in time-series data. Fault removal does not delete the faulty signal data but, instead, massages the fault from the data. We assume that only one fault occurs at any one time and model the signal by two separate non-parametric Gaussian process models for both the physical phenomenon and the fault. In order to facilitate fault removal we introduce the Markov Region Link kernel for handling non-stationary Gaussian processes. This kernel is piece-wise stationary but guarantees that functions generated by it and their derivatives (when required) are everywhere continuous. We apply this kernel to the removal of drift and bias errors in faulty sensor data and also to the recovery of EOG artifact corrupted EEG signals."}
{"text": "Kernel Bayes' rule has been proposed as a nonparametric kernel-based method to realize Bayesian inference in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the prediction result by kernel Bayes' rule is in some cases unnatural. We consider that this phenomenon is in part due to the fact that the assumptions in kernel Bayes' rule do not hold in general."}
{"text": "The dictionary-aided sparse regression (SR) approach has recently emerged as a promising alternative to hyperspectral unmixing (HU) in remote sensing. By using an available spectral library as a dictionary, the SR approach identifies the underlying materials in a given hyperspectral image by selecting a small subset of spectral samples in the dictionary to represent the whole image. A drawback with the current SR developments is that an actual spectral signature in the scene is often assumed to have zero mismatch with its corresponding dictionary sample, and such an assumption is considered too ideal in practice. In this paper, we tackle the spectral signature mismatch problem by proposing a dictionary-adjusted nonconvex sparsity-encouraging regression (DANSER) framework. The main idea is to incorporate dictionary correcting variables in an SR formulation. A simple and low per-iteration complexity algorithm is tailor-designed for practical realization of DANSER. Using the same dictionary correcting idea, we also propose a robust subspace solution for dictionary pruning. Extensive simulations and real-data experiments show that the proposed method is effective in mitigating the undesirable spectral signature mismatch effects."}
{"text": "Many statistical methods for network data parameterize the edge-probability by attributing latent traits to the vertices such as block structure and assume exchangeability in the sense of the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem. Empirical studies of networks indicate that many real-world networks have a power-law distribution of the vertices which in turn implies the number of edges scale slower than quadratically in the number of vertices. These assumptions are fundamentally irreconcilable as the Aldous-Hoover theorem implies quadratic scaling of the number of edges. Recently Caron and Fox (2014) proposed the use of a different notion of exchangeability due to Kallenberg (2009) and obtained a network model which admits power-law behaviour while retaining desirable statistical properties, however this model does not capture latent vertex traits such as block-structure. In this work we re-introduce the use of block-structure for network models obeying Kallenberg's notion of exchangeability and thereby obtain a model which admits the inference of block-structure and edge inhomogeneity. We derive a simple expression for the likelihood and an efficient sampling method. The obtained model is not significantly more difficult to implement than existing approaches to block-modelling and performs well on real network datasets."}
{"text": "Random survival forests (RSF) are a powerful method for risk prediction of right-censored outcomes in biomedical research. RSF use the log-rank split criterion to form an ensemble of survival trees. The most common approach to evaluate the prediction accuracy of a RSF model is Harrell's concordance index for survival data ('C index'). Conceptually, this strategy implies that the split criterion in RSF is different from the evaluation criterion of interest. This discrepancy can be overcome by using Harrell's C for both node splitting and evaluation. We compare the difference between the two split criteria analytically and in simulation studies with respect to the preference of more unbalanced splits, termed end-cut preference (ECP). Specifically, we show that the log-rank statistic has a stronger ECP compared to the C index. In simulation studies and with the help of two medical data sets we demonstrate that the accuracy of RSF predictions, as measured by Harrell's C, can be improved if the log-rank statistic is replaced by the C index for node splitting. This is especially true in situations where the censoring rate or the fraction of informative continuous predictor variables is high. Conversely, log-rank splitting is preferable in noisy scenarios. Both C-based and log-rank splitting are implemented in the R~package ranger. We recommend Harrell's C as split criterion for use in smaller scale clinical studies and the log-rank split criterion for use in large-scale 'omics' studies."}
{"text": "Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aims to factorize a matrix into two optimized nonnegative matrices appropriate for the intended applications. The method has been widely used for unsupervised learning tasks, including recommender systems (rating matrix of users by items) and document clustering (weighting matrix of papers by keywords). However, traditional NMF methods typically assume the number of latent factors (i.e., dimensionality of the loading matrices) to be fixed. This assumption makes them inflexible for many applications. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric NMF framework to mitigate this issue by using dependent Indian Buffet Processes (dIBP). In a nutshell, we apply a correlation function for the generation of two stick weights associated with each pair of columns of loading matrices, while still maintaining their respective marginal distribution specified by IBP. As a consequence, the generation of two loading matrices will be column-wise (indirectly) correlated. Under this same framework, two classes of correlation function are proposed (1) using Bivariate beta distribution and (2) using Copula function. Both methods allow us to adopt our work for various applications by flexibly choosing an appropriate parameter settings. Compared with the other state-of-the art approaches in this area, such as using Gaussian Process (GP)-based dIBP, our work is seen to be much more flexible in terms of allowing the two corresponding binary matrix columns to have greater variations in their non-zero entries. Our experiments on the real-world and synthetic datasets show that three proposed models perform well on the document clustering task comparing standard NMF without predefining the dimension for the factor matrices, and the Bivariate beta distribution-based and Copula-based models have better flexibility than the GP-based model."}
{"text": "Networks capture our intuition about relationships in the world. They describe the friendships between Facebook users, interactions in financial markets, and synapses connecting neurons in the brain. These networks are richly structured with cliques of friends, sectors of stocks, and a smorgasbord of cell types that govern how neurons connect. Some networks, like social network friendships, can be directly observed, but in many cases we only have an indirect view of the network through the actions of its constituents and an understanding of how the network mediates that activity. In this work, we focus on the problem of latent network discovery in the case where the observable activity takes the form of a mutually-excitatory point process known as a Hawkes process. We build on previous work that has taken a Bayesian approach to this problem, specifying prior distributions over the latent network structure and a likelihood of observed activity given this network. We extend this work by proposing a discrete-time formulation and developing a computationally efficient stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm that allows us to scale the approach to long sequences of observations. We demonstrate our algorithm on the calcium imaging data used in the Chalearn neural connectomics challenge."}

Techniques that efficiently estimate model coefficients by partitioning rows of the design matrix are increasingly popular for large-scale problems because they fit well with modern parallel computing architectures. We propose a simple measure of {\\em concordance} between a design matrix and a subset of its rows that estimates how well a subset captures the variance-covariance structure of a larger data set. We illustrate the use of this measure in a heuristic method for selecting row partition sizes that balance statistical and computational efficiency goals in real-world problems."}
{"text": "We consider factoring low-rank tensors in the presence of outlying slabs. This problem is important in practice, because data collected in many real-world applications, such as speech, fluorescence, and some social network data, fit this paradigm. Prior work tackles this problem by iteratively selecting a fixed number of slabs and fitting, a procedure which may not converge. We formulate this problem from a group-sparsity promoting point of view, and propose an alternating optimization framework to handle the corresponding $\\ell_p$ ($0<p\\leq 1$) minimization-based low-rank tensor factorization problem. The proposed algorithm features a similar per-iteration complexity as the plain trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is also easy to analyze under the framework of alternating optimization and its variants. In addition, regularization and constraints can be easily incorporated to make use of \\emph{a priori} information on the latent loading factors. Simulations and real data experiments on blind speech separation, fluorescence data analysis, and social network mining are used to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "We highlight a pitfall when applying stochastic variational inference to general Bayesian networks. For global random variables approximated by an exponential family distribution, natural gradient steps, commonly starting from a unit length step size, are averaged to convergence. This useful insight into the scaling of initial step sizes is lost when the approximation factorizes across a general Bayesian network, and care must be taken to ensure practical convergence. We experimentally investigate how much of the baby (well-scaled steps) is thrown out with the bath water (exact gradients)."}
{"text": "Variational methods have been recently considered for scaling the training process of Gaussian process classifiers to large datasets. As an alternative, we describe here how to train these classifiers efficiently using expectation propagation. The proposed method allows for handling datasets with millions of data instances. More precisely, it can be used for (i) training in a distributed fashion where the data instances are sent to different nodes in which the required computations are carried out, and for (ii) maximizing an estimate of the marginal likelihood using a stochastic approximation of the gradient. Several experiments indicate that the method described is competitive with the variational approach."}
{"text": "We introduce incremental variational inference and apply it to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Incremental variational inference is inspired by incremental EM and provides an alternative to stochastic variational inference. Incremental LDA can process massive document collections, does not require to set a learning rate, converges faster to a local optimum of the variational bound and enjoys the attractive property of monotonically increasing it. We study the performance of incremental LDA on large benchmark data sets. We further introduce a stochastic approximation of incremental variational inference which extends to the asynchronous distributed setting. The resulting distributed algorithm achieves comparable performance as single host incremental variational inference, but with a significant speed-up."}
{"text": "Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) using a sequential Monte Carlo method provides a comprehensive platform for parameter estimation, model selection and sensitivity analysis in differential equations. However, this method, like other Monte Carlo methods, incurs a significant computational cost as it requires explicit numerical integration of differential equations to carry out inference. In this paper we propose a novel method for circumventing the requirement of explicit integration by using derivatives of Gaussian processes to smooth the observations from which parameters are estimated. We evaluate our methods using synthetic data generated from model biological systems described by ordinary and delay differential equations. Upon comparing the performance of our method to existing ABC techniques, we demonstrate that it produces comparably reliable parameter estimates at a significantly reduced execution time."}

The goal of the paper is to develop minimax lower bounds on error rates of estimation of low rank density matrices in trace regression models used in quantum state tomography (in particular, in the case of Pauli measurements) with explicit dependence of the bounds on the rank and other complexity parameters. Such bounds are established for several statistically relevant distances, including quantum versions of Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy distance) and of Hellinger distance (so called Bures distance), and Schatten $p$-norm distances. Sharp upper bounds and oracle inequalities for least squares estimator with von Neumann entropy penalization are obtained showing that minimax lower bounds are attained (up to logarithmic factors) for these distances."}
{"text": "Many modern data analysis problems involve inferences from streaming data. However, streaming data is not easily amenable to the standard probabilistic modeling approaches, which assume that we condition on finite data. We develop population variational Bayes, a new approach for using Bayesian modeling to analyze streams of data. It approximates a new type of distribution, the population posterior, which combines the notion of a population distribution of the data with Bayesian inference in a probabilistic model. We study our method with latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixtures on several large-scale data sets."}
{"text": "Methods of transfer learning try to combine knowledge from several related tasks (or domains) to improve performance on a test task. Inspired by causal methodology, we relax the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant over all tasks. We show how this assumption can be motivated from ideas in the field of causality. We focus on the problem of Domain Generalization, in which no examples from the test task are observed. We prove that in an adversarial setting using this subset for prediction is optimal in Domain Generalization; we further provide examples, in which the tasks are sufficiently diverse and the estimator therefore outperforms pooling the data, even on average. If examples from the test task are available, we also provide a method to transfer knowledge from the training tasks and exploit all available features for prediction. However, we provide no guarantees for this method. We introduce a practical method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset and provide corresponding code. We present results on synthetic data sets and a gene deletion data set."}
{"text": "Adaptive Monte Carlo schemes developed over the last years usually seek to ensure ergodicity of the sampling process in line with MCMC tradition. This poses constraints on what is possible in terms of adaptation. In the general case ergodicity can only be guaranteed if adaptation is diminished at a certain rate. Importance Sampling approaches offer a way to circumvent this limitation and design sampling algorithms that keep adapting. Here I present a gradient informed variant of SMC (and its special case Population Monte Carlo) for static problems."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider a statistical problem of learning a linear model from noisy samples. Existing work has focused on approximating the least squares solution by using leverage-based scores as an importance sampling distribution. However, no finite sample statistical guarantees and no computationally efficient optimal sampling strategies have been proposed. To evaluate the statistical properties of different sampling strategies, we propose a simple yet effective estimator, which is easy for theoretical analysis and is useful in multitask linear regression. We derive the exact mean square error of the proposed estimator for any given sampling scores. Based on minimizing the mean square error, we propose the optimal sampling scores for both estimator and predictor, and show that they are influenced by the noise-to-signal ratio. Numerical simulations match the theoretical analysis well."}
{"text": "Capturing the dependence structure of multivariate extreme events is a major concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple sources, e.g. portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management and anomaly detection. One convenient (non-parametric) characterization of extremal dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable 'directions' of extremes, that is, the relative contribution of each feature/coordinate of the 'largest' observations. Modeling the angular measure in high dimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at exhibiting a sparsity pattern within the dependence structure of extremes. This is done by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on representative sets of directions, corresponding to specific sub-cones of $R^d\\_+$. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct application a --first-- anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT. This algorithm builds a sparse 'normal profile' of extreme behaviours, to be confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach."}
{"text": "Recent decades have seen an interest in prediction problems for which Bayesian methodology has been used ubiquitously. Sampling from or approximating the posterior predictive distribution in a Bayesian model allows one to make inferential statements about potentially observable random quantities given observed data. The purpose of this note is to use statistical decision theory as a basis to justify the use of a posterior predictive distribution for making a point prediction."}
{"text": "One of the limiting factors of using support vector machines (SVMs) in large scale applications are their super-linear computational requirements in terms of the number of training samples. To address this issue, several approaches that train SVMs on many small chunks of large data sets separately have been proposed in the literature. So far, however, almost all these approaches have only been empirically investigated. In addition, their motivation was always based on computational requirements. In this work, we consider a localized SVM approach based upon a partition of the input space. For this local SVM, we derive a general oracle inequality. Then we apply this oracle inequality to least squares regression using Gaussian kernels and deduce local learning rates that are essentially minimax optimal under some standard smoothness assumptions on the regression function. This gives the first motivation for using local SVMs that is not based on computational requirements but on theoretical predictions on the generalization performance. We further introduce a data-dependent parameter selection method for our local SVM approach and show that this method achieves the same learning rates as before. Finally, we present some larger scale experiments for our localized SVM showing that it achieves essentially the same test performance as a global SVM for a fraction of the computational requirements. In addition, it turns out that the computational requirements for the local SVMs are similar to those of a vanilla random chunk approach, while the achieved test errors are significantly better."}
{"text": "Symbolic Data Analysis is based on special descriptions of data - symbolic objects (SO). Such descriptions preserve more detailed information about units and their clusters than the usual representations with mean values. A special kind of symbolic object is a representation with frequency or probability distributions (modal values). This representation enables us to consider in the clustering process the variables of all measurement types at the same time. In the paper a clustering criterion function for SOs is proposed such that the representative of each cluster is again composed of distributions of variables' values over the cluster. The corresponding leaders clustering method is based on this result. It is also shown that for the corresponding agglomerative hierarchical method a generalized Ward's formula holds. Both methods are compatible - they are solving the same clustering optimization problem. The leaders method efficiently solves clustering problems with large number of units; while the agglomerative method can be applied alone on the smaller data set, or it could be applied on leaders, obtained with compatible nonhierarchical clustering method. Such a combination of two compatible methods enables us to decide upon the right number of clusters on the basis of the corresponding dendrogram. The proposed methods were applied on different data sets. In the paper, some results of clustering of ESS data are presented."}
{"text": "In this paper we introduce a novel framework for making exact nonparametric Bayesian inference on latent functions, that is particularly suitable for Big Data tasks. Firstly, we introduce a class of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs), which are not to be mistaken for Gaussian processes operating on text. We construct string GPs so that their finite-dimensional marginals exhibit suitable local conditional independence structures, which allow for scalable, distributed, and flexible nonparametric Bayesian inference, without resorting to approximations, and while ensuring some mild global regularity constraints. Furthermore, string GP priors naturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learned latent function is readily available for explanatory analysis. Secondly, we provide some theoretical results relating our approach to the standard GP paradigm. In particular, we prove that some string GPs are Gaussian processes, which provides a complementary global perspective on our framework. Finally, we derive a scalable and distributed MCMC scheme for supervised learning tasks under string GP priors. The proposed MCMC scheme has computational time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ and memory requirement $\\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $N$ is the data size and $d$ the dimension of the input space. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on several synthetic and real-world datasets, including a dataset with $6$ millions input points and $8$ attributes."}
{"text": "This work studies the class of algorithms for learning with side-information that emerge by extending generative models with embedded context-related variables. Using finite mixture models (FMM) as the prototypical Bayesian network, we show that maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of parameters through expectation-maximization (EM) improves over the regular unsupervised case and can approach the performances of supervised learning, despite the absence of any explicit ground truth data labeling. By direct application of the missing information principle (MIP), the algorithms' performances are proven to range between the conventional supervised and unsupervised MLE extremities proportionally to the information content of the contextual assistance provided. The acquired benefits regard higher estimation precision, smaller standard errors, faster convergence rates and improved classification accuracy or regression fitness shown in various scenarios, while also highlighting important properties and differences among the outlined situations. Applicability is showcased with three real-world unsupervised classification scenarios employing Gaussian Mixture Models. Importantly, we exemplify the natural extension of this methodology to any type of generative model by deriving an equivalent context-aware algorithm for variational autoencoders (VAs), thus broadening the spectrum of applicability to unsupervised deep learning with artificial neural networks. The latter is contrasted with a neural-symbolic algorithm exploiting side-information."}
{"text": "Log-density gradient estimation is a fundamental statistical problem and possesses various practical applications such as clustering and measuring non-Gaussianity. A naive two-step approach of first estimating the density and then taking its log-gradient is unreliable because an accurate density estimate does not necessarily lead to an accurate log-density gradient estimate. To cope with this problem, a method to directly estimate the log-density gradient without density estimation has been explored, and demonstrated to work much better than the two-step method. The objective of this paper is to further improve the performance of this direct method in multi-dimensional cases. Our idea is to regard the problem of log-density gradient estimation in each dimension as a task, and apply regularized multi-task learning to the direct log-density gradient estimator. We experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed multi-task method in log-density gradient estimation and mode-seeking clustering."}
{"text": "A typical goal of supervised dimension reduction is to find a low-dimensional subspace of the input space such that the projected input variables preserve maximal information about the output variables. The dependence maximization approach solves the supervised dimension reduction problem through maximizing a statistical dependence between projected input variables and output variables. A well-known statistical dependence measure is mutual information (MI) which is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, it is known that the KL divergence is sensitive to outliers. On the other hand, quadratic MI (QMI) is a variant of MI based on the $L_2$ distance which is more robust against outliers than the KL divergence, and a computationally efficient method to estimate QMI from data, called least-squares QMI (LSQMI), has been proposed recently. For these reasons, developing a supervised dimension reduction method based on LSQMI seems promising. However, not QMI itself, but the derivative of QMI is needed for subspace search in supervised dimension reduction, and the derivative of an accurate QMI estimator is not necessarily a good estimator of the derivative of QMI. In this paper, we propose to directly estimate the derivative of QMI without estimating QMI itself. We show that the direct estimation of the derivative of QMI is more accurate than the derivative of the estimated QMI. Finally, we develop a supervised dimension reduction algorithm which efficiently uses the proposed derivative estimator, and demonstrate through experiments that the proposed method is more robust against outliers than existing methods."}
{"text": "We study statistical calibration, i.e., adjusting features of a computational model that are not observable or controllable in its associated physical system. We focus on functional calibration, which arises in many manufacturing processes where the unobservable features, called calibration variables, are a function of the input variables. A major challenge in many applications is that computational models are expensive and can only be evaluated a limited number of times. Furthermore, without making strong assumptions, the calibration variables are not identifiable. We propose Bayesian non-isometric matching calibration (BNMC) that allows calibration of expensive computational models with only a limited number of samples taken from a computational model and its associated physical system. BNMC replaces the computational model with a dynamic Gaussian process (GP) whose parameters are trained in the calibration procedure. To resolve the identifiability issue, we present the calibration problem from a geometric perspective of non-isometric curve to surface matching, which enables us to take advantage of combinatorial optimization techniques to extract necessary information for constructing prior distributions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that in terms of prediction accuracy BNMC outperforms, or is comparable to, other existing calibration frameworks."}
{"text": "We study large-scale spatial systems that contain exogenous variables, e.g. environmental factors that are significant predictors in spatial processes. Building predictive models for such processes is challenging because the large numbers of observations present makes it inefficient to apply full Kriging. In order to reduce computational complexity, this paper proposes Sparse Pseudo-input Local Kriging (SPLK), which utilizes hyperplanes to partition a domain into smaller subdomains and then applies a sparse approximation of the full Kriging to each subdomain. We also develop an optimization procedure to find the desired hyperplanes. To alleviate the problem of discontinuity in the global predictor, we impose continuity constraints on the boundaries of the neighboring subdomains. Furthermore, partitioning the domain into smaller subdomains makes it possible to use different parameter values for the covariance function in each region and, therefore, the heterogeneity in the data structure can be effectively captured. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SPLK outperforms, or is comparable to, the algorithms commonly applied to spatial datasets."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of structure learning for bow-free acyclic path diagrams (BAPs). BAPs can be viewed as a generalization of linear Gaussian DAG models that allow for certain hidden variables. We present a first method for this problem using a greedy score-based search algorithm. We also prove some necessary and some sufficient conditions for distributional equivalence of BAPs which are used in an algorithmic ap- proach to compute (nearly) equivalent model structures. This allows us to infer lower bounds of causal effects. We also present applications to real and simulated datasets using our publicly available R-package."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of minimizing a sum of $n$ functions over a convex parameter set $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^p$ where $n\\gg p\\gg 1$. In this regime, algorithms which utilize sub-sampling techniques are known to be effective. In this paper, we use sub-sampling techniques together with low-rank approximation to design a new randomized batch algorithm which possesses comparable convergence rate to Newton's method, yet has much smaller per-iteration cost. The proposed algorithm is robust in terms of starting point and step size, and enjoys a composite convergence rate, namely, quadratic convergence at start and linear convergence when the iterate is close to the minimizer. We develop its theoretical analysis which also allows us to select near-optimal algorithm parameters. Our theoretical results can be used to obtain convergence rates of previously proposed sub-sampling based algorithms as well. We demonstrate how our results apply to well-known machine learning problems. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several datasets under various scenarios."}
{"text": "Dropout has recently emerged as a powerful and simple method for training neural networks preventing co-adaptation by stochastically omitting neurons. Dropout is currently not grounded in explicit modelling assumptions which so far has precluded its adoption in Bayesian modelling. Using Bayesian entropic reasoning we show that dropout can be interpreted as optimal inference under constraints. We demonstrate this on an analytically tractable regression model providing a Bayesian interpretation of its mechanism for regularizing and preventing co-adaptation as well as its connection to other Bayesian techniques. We also discuss two general approximate techniques for applying Bayesian dropout for general models, one based on an analytical approximation and the other on stochastic variational techniques. These techniques are then applied to a Baysian logistic regression problem and are shown to improve performance as the model become more misspecified. Our framework roots dropout as a theoretically justified and practical tool for statistical modelling allowing Bayesians to tap into the benefits of dropout training."}
{"text": "Most existing binary classification methods target on the optimization of the overall classification risk and may fail to serve some real-world applications such as cancer diagnosis, where users are more concerned with the risk of misclassifying one specific class than the other. Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm was introduced in this context as a novel statistical framework for handling asymmetric type I/II error priorities. It seeks classifiers with a minimal type II error and a constrained type I error under a user specified level. This article is the first attempt to construct classifiers with guaranteed theoretical performance under the NP paradigm in high-dimensional settings. Based on the fundamental Neyman-Pearson Lemma, we used a plug-in approach to construct NP-type classifiers for Naive Bayes models. The proposed classifiers satisfy the NP oracle inequalities, which are natural NP paradigm counterparts of the oracle inequalities in classical binary classification. Besides their desirable theoretical properties, we also demonstrated their numerical advantages in prioritized error control via both simulation and real data studies."}
{"text": "Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a popular and efficient tool for global optimization and hyperparameter tuning. Currently, the established Bayesian optimization practice requires a user-defined bounding box which is assumed to contain the optimizer. However, when little is known about the probed objective function, it can be difficult to prescribe such bounds. In this work we modify the standard Bayesian optimization framework in a principled way to allow automatic resizing of the search space. We introduce two alternative methods and compare them on two common synthetic benchmarking test functions as well as the tasks of tuning the stochastic gradient descent optimizer of a multi-layered perceptron and a convolutional neural network on MNIST."}
{"text": "We present a novel approach for fully non-stationary Gaussian process regression (GPR), where all three key parameters -- noise variance, signal variance and lengthscale -- can be simultaneously input-dependent. We develop gradient-based inference methods to learn the unknown function and the non-stationary model parameters, without requiring any model approximations. We propose to infer full parameter posterior with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which conveniently extends the analytical gradient-based GPR learning by guiding the sampling with model gradients. We also learn the MAP solution from the posterior by gradient ascent. In experiments on several synthetic datasets and in modelling of temporal gene expression, the nonstationary GPR is shown to be necessary for modeling realistic input-dependent dynamics, while it performs comparably to conventional stationary or previous non-stationary GPR models otherwise."}
{"text": "We are interested in solving the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem for instances, where the underlying sparsity pattern exhibit spatio-temporal structure motivated by the electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization problem. We propose a probabilistic model that takes this structure into account by generalizing the structured spike and slab prior and the associated Expectation Propagation inference scheme. Based on numerical experiments, we demonstrate the viability of the model and the approximate inference scheme."}
{"text": "Distance weighted discrimination (DWD) is a margin-based classifier with an interesting geometric motivation. DWD was originally proposed as a superior alternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be popular compared with the SVM. The main reasons are twofold. First, the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone programming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is much more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD mainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting and data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency of DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work, we advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and theoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving DWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing state-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can handle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a special DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural kernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel DWD. We compare DWD and the SVM on several benchmark data sets and show that the two have comparable classification accuracy, but DWD equipped with our new algorithm can be much faster to compute than the SVM."}
{"text": "A general approach for anomaly detection or novelty detection consists in estimating high density regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates. Results on actual data sets are also presented."}
{"text": "While stochastic variational inference is relatively well known for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models, related methods also offer ways to circumnavigate the approximation of analytically intractable expectations. The key challenge in either setting is controlling the variance of gradient estimates: recent work has shown that for continuous latent variables, particularly multivariate Gaussians, this can be achieved by using the gradient of the log posterior. In this paper we apply the same idea to gamma distributed latent variables given gamma variational distributions, enabling straightforward \"black box\" variational inference in models where sparsity and non-negativity are appropriate. We demonstrate the method on a recently proposed gamma process model for network data, as well as a novel sparse factor analysis. We outperform generic sampling algorithms and the approach of using Gaussian variational distributions on transformed variables."}
{"text": "This text investigates relations between two well-known family of algorithms, matrix factorisations and recursive linear filters, by describing a probabilistic model in which approximate inference corresponds to a matrix factorisation algorithm. Using the probabilistic model, we derive a matrix factorisation algorithm as a recursive linear filter. More precisely, we derive a matrix-variate recursive linear filter in order to perform efficient inference in high dimensions. We also show that it is possible to interpret our algorithm as a nontrivial stochastic gradient algorithm. Demonstrations and comparisons on an image restoration task are given."}
{"text": "Large sample size brings the computation bottleneck for modern data analysis. Subsampling is one of efficient strategies to handle this problem. In previous studies, researchers make more fo- cus on subsampling with replacement (SSR) than on subsampling without replacement (SSWR). In this paper we investigate a kind of SSWR, poisson subsampling (PSS), for fast algorithm in ordinary least-square problem. We establish non-asymptotic property, i.e, the error bound of the correspond- ing subsample estimator, which provide a tradeoff between computation cost and approximation efficiency. Besides the non-asymptotic result, we provide asymptotic consistency and normality of the subsample estimator. Methodologically, we propose a two-step subsampling algorithm, which is efficient with respect to a statistical objective and independent on the linear model assumption.. Synthetic and real data are used to empirically study our proposed subsampling strategies. We argue by these empirical studies that, (1) our proposed two-step algorithm has obvious advantage when the assumed linear model does not accurate, and (2) the PSS strategy performs obviously better than SSR when the subsampling ratio increases."}
{"text": "In this paper, we focus on the stochastic block model (SBM),a probabilistic tool describing interactions between nodes of a network using latent clusters. The SBM assumes that the networkhas a stationary structure, in which connections of time varying intensity are not taken into account. In other words, interactions between two groups are forced to have the same features during the whole observation time. To overcome this limitation,we propose a partition of the whole time horizon, in which interactions are observed, and develop a non stationary extension of the SBM,allowing to simultaneously cluster the nodes in a network along with fixed time intervals in which the interactions take place. The number of clusters (K for nodes, D for time intervals) as well as the class memberships are finallyobtained through maximizing the complete-data integrated likelihood by means of a greedy search approach. After showing that the model works properly with simulated data, we focus on a real data set. We thus consider the three days ACM Hypertext conference held in Turin,June 29th - July 1st 2009. Proximity interactions between attendees during the first day are modelled and an interestingclustering of the daily hours is finally obtained, with times of social gathering (e.g. coffee breaks) recovered by the approach. Applications to large networks are limited due to the computational complexity of the greedy search which is dominated bythe number $K\\_{max}$ and $D\\_{max}$ of clusters used in the initialization. Therefore,advanced clustering tools are considered to reduce the number of clusters expected in the data, making the greedy search applicable to large networks."}
{"text": "We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We show that finding the best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression. We also show that, under some asumptions, universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization remains possible using the MAPE."}
{"text": "Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is a class of online margin-based algorithms suitable for a wide range of real-time prediction tasks, including classification and regression. PA algorithms are formulated in terms of deterministic point-estimation problems governed by a set of user-defined hyperparameters: the approach fails to capture model/prediction uncertainty and makes their performance highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. In this paper, we introduce a novel PA learning framework for regression that overcomes the above limitations. We contribute a Bayesian state-space interpretation of PA regression, along with a novel online variational inference scheme, that not only produces probabilistic predictions, but also offers the benefit of automatic hyperparameter tuning. Experiments with various real-world data sets show that our approach performs significantly better than a more standard, linear Gaussian state-space model."}
{"text": "We propose a second-order (Hessian or Hessian-free) based optimization method for variational inference inspired by Gaussian backpropagation, and argue that quasi-Newton optimization can be developed as well. This is accomplished by generalizing the gradient computation in stochastic backpropagation via a reparametrization trick with lower complexity. As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to the problems of Bayesian logistic regression and variational auto-encoder (VAE). Additionally, we compute bounds on the estimator variance of intractable expectations for the family of Lipschitz continuous function. Our method is practical, scalable and model free. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets and provide comparisons with other stochastic gradient methods to show substantial enhancement in convergence rates."}
{"text": "In this study, we propose an automatic learning method for variables selection based on Lasso in epidemiology context. One of the aim of this approach is to overcome the pretreatment of experts in medicine and epidemiology on collected data. These pretreatment consist in recoding some variables and to choose some interactions based on expertise. The approach proposed uses all available explanatory variables without treatment and generate automatically all interactions between them. This lead to high dimension. We use Lasso, one of the robust methods of variable selection in high dimension. To avoid over fitting a two levels cross-validation is used. Because the target variable is account variable and the lasso estimators are biased, variables selected by lasso are debiased by a GLM and used to predict the distribution of the main vector of malaria which is Anopheles. Results show that only few climatic and environmental variables are the mains factors associated to the malaria risk exposure."}
{"text": "Using a proper model to characterize a time series is crucial in making accurate predictions. In this work we use time-varying autoregressive process (TVAR) to describe non-stationary time series and model it as a mixture of multiple stable autoregressive (AR) processes. We introduce a new model selection technique based on Gap statistics to learn the appropriate number of AR filters needed to model a time series. We define a new distance measure between stable AR filters and draw a reference curve that is used to measure how much adding a new AR filter improves the performance of the model, and then choose the number of AR filters that has the maximum gap with the reference curve. To that end, we propose a new method in order to generate uniform random stable AR filters in root domain. Numerical results are provided demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "We study the restless bandit associated with an extremely simple scalar Kalman filter model in discrete time. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the problem is indexable in the sense that the Whittle index is a non-decreasing function of the relevant belief state. In spite of the long history of this problem, this appears to be the first such proof. We use results about Schur-convexity and mechanical words, which are particular binary strings intimately related to palindromes."}
{"text": "We propose Macau, a powerful and flexible Bayesian factorization method for heterogeneous data. Our model can factorize any set of entities and relations that can be represented by a relational model, including tensors and also multiple relations for each entity. Macau can also incorporate side information, specifically entity and relation features, which are crucial for predicting sparsely observed relations. Macau scales to millions of entity instances, hundred millions of observations, and sparse entity features with millions of dimensions. To achieve the scale up, we specially designed sampling procedure for entity and relation features that relies primarily on noise injection in linear regressions. We show performance and advanced features of Macau in a set of experiments, including challenging drug-protein activity prediction task."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the problem of scalable optimization for L1-regularized conditional Gaussian graphical models. Conditional Gaussian graphical models generalize the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional distributions to model the output network influenced by conditioning input variables. While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation, state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly, fail due to memory constraints for very large problems. In this paper, we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently iterates over two sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared to the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems under memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show that our methods can solve one million dimensional problems to high accuracy in a little over a day on a single machine."}
{"text": "Tree structures are ubiquitous in data across many domains, and many datasets are naturally modelled by unobserved tree structures. In this paper, first we review the theory of random fragmentation processes [Bertoin, 2006], and a number of existing methods for modelling trees, including the popular nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP). Then we define a general class of probability distributions over trees: the Dirichlet fragmentation process (DFP) through a novel combination of the theory of Dirichlet processes and random fragmentation processes. This DFP presents a stick-breaking construction, and relates to the nCRP in the same way the Dirichlet process relates to the Chinese restaurant process. Furthermore, we develop a novel hierarchical mixture model with the DFP, and empirically compare the new model to similar models in machine learning. Experiments show the DFP mixture model to be convincingly better than existing state-of-the-art approaches for hierarchical clustering and density modelling."}
{"text": "In this paper we develop a statistical theory and an implementation of deep learning models. We show that an elegant variable splitting scheme for the alternating direction method of multipliers optimises a deep learning objective. We allow for non-smooth non-convex regularisation penalties to induce sparsity in parameter weights. We provide a link between traditional shallow layer statistical models such as principal component and sliced inverse regression and deep layer models. We also define the degrees of freedom of a deep learning predictor and a predictive MSE criteria to perform model selection for comparing architecture designs. We focus on deep multiclass logistic learning although our methods apply more generally. Our results suggest an interesting and previously under-exploited relationship between deep learning and proximal splitting techniques. To illustrate our methodology, we provide a multi-class logit classification analysis of Fisher's Iris data where we illustrate the convergence of our algorithm. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research."}
{"text": "Given i.i.d samples from some unknown continuous density on hyper-rectangle $[0, 1]^d$, we attempt to learn a piecewise constant function that approximates this underlying density non-parametrically. Our density estimate is defined on a binary split of $[0, 1]^d$ and built up sequentially according to discrepancy criteria; the key ingredient is to control the discrepancy adaptively in each sub-rectangle to achieve overall bound. We prove that the estimate, even though simple as it appears, preserves most of the estimation power. By exploiting its structure, it can be directly applied to some important pattern recognition tasks such as mode seeking and density landscape exploration. We demonstrate its applicability through simulations and examples."}
{"text": "We briefly review recent progress in techniques for modeling and analyzing hyperspectral images and movies, in particular for detecting plumes of both known and unknown chemicals. For detecting chemicals of known spectrum, we extend the technique of using a single subspace for modeling the background to a \"mixture of subspaces\" model to tackle more complicated background. Furthermore, we use partial least squares regression on a resampled training set to boost performance. For the detection of unknown chemicals we view the problem as an anomaly detection problem, and use novel estimators with low-sampled complexity for intrinsically low-dimensional data in high-dimensions that enable us to model the \"normal\" spectra and detect anomalies. We apply these algorithms to benchmark data sets made available by the Automated Target Detection program co-funded by NSF, DTRA and NGA, and compare, when applicable, to current state-of-the-art algorithms, with favorable results."}
{"text": "We consider continuous time Markovian processes where populations of individual agents interact stochastically according to kinetic rules. Despite the increasing prominence of such models in fields ranging from biology to smart cities, Bayesian inference for such systems remains challenging, as these are continuous time, discrete state systems with potentially infinite state-space. Here we propose a novel efficient algorithm for joint state / parameter posterior sampling in population Markov Jump processes. We introduce a class of pseudo-marginal sampling algorithms based on a random truncation method which enables a principled treatment of infinite state spaces. Extensive evaluation on a number of benchmark models shows that this approach achieves considerable savings compared to state of the art methods, retaining accuracy and fast convergence. We also present results on a synthetic biology data set showing the potential for practical usefulness of our work."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of transforming samples from one continuous source distribution into samples from another target distribution. We demonstrate with optimal transport theory that when the source distribution can be easily sampled from and the target distribution is log-concave, this can be tractably solved with convex optimization. We show that a special case of this, when the source is the prior and the target is the posterior, is Bayesian inference. Here, we can tractably calculate the normalization constant and draw posterior i.i.d. samples. Remarkably, our Bayesian tractability criterion is simply log concavity of the prior and likelihood: the same criterion for tractable calculation of the maximum a posteriori point estimate. With simulated data, we demonstrate how we can attain the Bayes risk in simulations. With physiologic data, we demonstrate improvements over point estimation in intensive care unit outcome prediction and electroencephalography-based sleep staging."}
{"text": "The estimation of probabilities of network edges from the observed adjacency matrix has important applications to predicting missing links and network denoising. It has usually been addressed by estimating the graphon, a function that determines the matrix of edge probabilities, but this is ill-defined without strong assumptions on the network structure. Here we propose a novel computationally efficient method, based on neighborhood smoothing to estimate the expectation of the adjacency matrix directly, without making the structural assumptions that graphon estimation requires. The neighborhood smoothing method requires little tuning, has a competitive mean-squared error rate, and outperforms many benchmark methods on link prediction in simulated and real networks."}
{"text": "A latent space model for a family of random graphs assigns real-valued vectors to nodes of the graph such that edge probabilities are determined by latent positions. Latent space models provide a natural statistical framework for graph visualizing and clustering. A latent space model of particular interest is the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), which can be fit using an efficient spectral method; however, this method is based on a heuristic that can fail, even in simple cases. Here, we consider a closely related latent space model, the Logistic RDPG, which uses a logistic link function to map from latent positions to edge likelihoods. Over this model, we show that asymptotically exact maximum likelihood inference of latent position vectors can be achieved using an efficient spectral method. Our method involves computing top eigenvectors of a normalized adjacency matrix and scaling eigenvectors using a regression step. The novel regression scaling step is an essential part of the proposed method. In simulations, we show that our proposed method is more accurate and more robust than common practices. We also show the effectiveness of our approach over standard real networks of the karate club and political blogs."}
{"text": "Hierarchical learning models, such as mixture models and Bayesian networks, are widely employed for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering analysis. They consist of observable and hidden variables, which represent the given data and their hidden generation process, respectively. It has been pointed out that conventional statistical analysis is not applicable to these models, because redundancy of the latent variable produces singularities in the parameter space. In recent years, a method based on algebraic geometry has allowed us to analyze the accuracy of predicting observable variables when using Bayesian estimation. However, how to analyze latent variables has not been sufficiently studied, even though one of the main issues in unsupervised learning is to determine how accurately the latent variable is estimated. A previous study proposed a method that can be used when the range of the latent variable is redundant compared with the model generating data. The present paper extends that method to the situation in which the latent variables have redundant dimensions. We formulate new error functions and derive their asymptotic forms. Calculation of the error functions is demonstrated in two-layered Bayesian networks."}
{"text": "We consider the \\mnk{classical} problem of a controller activating (or sampling) sequentially from a finite number of $N \\geq 2$ populations, specified by unknown distributions. Over some time horizon, at each time $n = 1, 2, \\ldots$, the controller wishes to select a population to sample, with the goal of sampling from a population that optimizes some \"score\" function of its distribution, e.g., maximizing the expected sum of outcomes or minimizing variability. We define a class of \\textit{Uniformly Fast (UF)} sampling policies and show, under mild regularity conditions, that there is an asymptotic lower bound for the expected total number of sub-optimal population activations. Then, we provide sufficient conditions under which a UCB policy is UF and asymptotically optimal, since it attains this lower bound. Explicit solutions are provided for a number of examples of interest, including general score functionals on unconstrained Pareto distributions (of potentially infinite mean), and uniform distributions of unknown support. Additional results on bandits of Normal distributions are also provided."}
{"text": "We consider sequential decision making problems for binary classification scenario in which the learner takes an active role in repeatedly selecting samples from the action pool and receives the binary label of the selected alternatives. Our problem is motivated by applications where observations are time consuming and/or expensive, resulting in small samples. The goal is to identify the best alternative with the highest response. We use Bayesian logistic regression to predict the response of each alternative. By formulating the problem as a Markov decision process, we develop a knowledge-gradient type policy to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information of labeling each alternative and provide a finite-time analysis on the estimated error. Experiments on benchmark UCI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "In this paper we introduce a novel online time series forecasting model we refer to as the pM-GP filter. We show that our model is equivalent to Gaussian process regression, with the advantage that both online forecasting and online learning of the hyper-parameters have a constant (rather than cubic) time complexity and a constant (rather than squared) memory requirement in the number of observations, without resorting to approximations. Moreover, the proposed model is expressive in that the family of covariance functions of the implied latent process, namely the spectral Matern kernels, have recently been proven to be capable of approximating arbitrarily well any translation-invariant covariance function. The benefit of our approach compared to competing models is demonstrated using experiments on several real-life datasets."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of extracting a low-dimensional, linear latent variable structure from high-dimensional random variables. Specifically, we show that under mild conditions and when this structure manifests itself as a linear space that spans the conditional means, it is possible to consistently recover the structure using only information up to the second moments of these random variables. This finding, specialized to one-parameter exponential families whose variance function is quadratic in their means, allows for the derivation of an explicit estimator of such latent structure. This approach serves as a latent variable model estimator and as a tool for dimension reduction for a high-dimensional matrix of data composed of many related variables. Our theoretical results are verified by simulation studies and an application to genomic data."}
{"text": "In order to identify important variables that are involved in making optimal treatment decision, Lu et al. (2013) proposed a penalized least squared regression framework for a fixed number of predictors, which is robust against the misspecification of the conditional mean model. Two problems arise: (i) in a world of explosively big data, effective methods are needed to handle ultra-high dimensional data set, for example, with the dimension of predictors is of the non-polynomial (NP) order of the sample size; (ii) both the propensity score and conditional mean models need to be estimated from data under NP dimensionality.   In this paper, we propose a two-step estimation procedure for deriving the optimal treatment regime under NP dimensionality. In both steps, penalized regressions are employed with the non-concave penalty function, where the conditional mean model of the response given predictors may be misspecified. The asymptotic properties, such as weak oracle properties, selection consistency and oracle distributions, of the proposed estimators are investigated. In addition, we study the limiting distribution of the estimated value function for the obtained optimal treatment regime. The empirical performance of the proposed estimation method is evaluated by simulations and an application to a depression dataset from the STAR*D study."}
{"text": "We address the problem of detecting changes in multivariate datastreams, and we investigate the intrinsic difficulty that change-detection methods have to face when the data dimension scales. In particular, we consider a general approach where changes are detected by comparing the distribution of the log-likelihood of the datastream over different time windows. Despite the fact that this approach constitutes the frame of several change-detection methods, its effectiveness when data dimension scales has never been investigated, which is indeed the goal of our paper. We show that the magnitude of the change can be naturally measured by the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions, and that the detectability of a change of a given magnitude worsens when the data dimension increases. This problem, which we refer to as \\emph{detectability loss}, is due to the linear relationship between the variance of the log-likelihood and the data dimension. We analytically derive the detectability loss on Gaussian-distributed datastreams, and empirically demonstrate that this problem holds also on real-world datasets and that can be harmful even at low data-dimensions (say, 10)."}
{"text": "Robust Bayesian models are appealing alternatives to standard models, providing protection from data that contains outliers or other departures from the model assumptions. Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches, especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation."}
{"text": "We introduce a multivariate stochastic volatility model for asset returns that imposes no restrictions to the structure of the volatility matrix and treats all its elements as functions of latent stochastic processes. When the number of assets is prohibitively large, we propose a factor multivariate stochastic volatility model in which the variances and correlations of the factors evolve stochastically over time. Inference is achieved via a carefully designed feasible and scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that combines two computationally important ingredients: it utilizes invariant to the prior Metropolis proposal densities for simultaneously updating all latent paths and has quadratic, rather than cubic, computational complexity when evaluating the multivariate normal densities required. We apply our modelling and computational methodology to $571$ stock daily returns of Euro STOXX index for data over a period of $10$ years. MATLAB software for this paper is available at http://www.aueb.gr/users/mtitsias/code/msv.zip."}
{"text": "In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvectors of the modularity matrix and the singular vectors of an uncentered data matrix is developed. Based on this analysis the concept of a modularity component is defined, and its properties are developed. It is shown that modularity component analysis can be used to cluster data similar to how traditional principal component analysis is used except that modularity component analysis does not require data centering."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider the problem of stochastic optimization under a bandit feedback model. We generalize the GP-UCB algorithm [Srinivas and al., 2012] to arbitrary kernels and search spaces. To do so, we use a notion of localized chaining to control the supremum of a Gaussian process, and provide a novel optimization scheme based on the computation of covering numbers. The theoretical bounds we obtain on the cumulative regret are more generic and present the same convergence rates as the GP-UCB algorithm. Finally, the algorithm is shown to be empirically more efficient than its natural competitors on simple and complex input spaces."}
{"text": "Early stopping is a well known approach to reduce the time complexity for performing training and model selection of large scale learning machines. On the other hand, memory/space (rather than time) complexity is the main constraint in many applications, and randomized subsampling techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. In this paper we ask whether early stopping and subsampling ideas can be combined in a fruitful way. We consider the question in a least squares regression setting and propose a form of randomized iterative regularization based on early stopping and subsampling. In this context, we analyze the statistical and computational properties of the proposed method. Theoretical results are complemented and validated by a thorough experimental analysis."}
{"text": "We propose a novel method for multiple clustering that assumes a co-clustering structure (partitions in both rows and columns of the data matrix) in each view. The new method is applicable to high-dimensional data. It is based on a nonparametric Bayesian approach in which the number of views and the number of feature-/subject clusters are inferred in a data-driven manner. We simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and multinomial distributions in each cluster block. This makes our method applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical variables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based on variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed method to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other multiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in computation time. Finally, we apply our method to a depression dataset with no true cluster structure available, from which useful inferences are drawn about possible clustering structures of the data."}
{"text": "We present GLASSES: Global optimisation with Look-Ahead through Stochastic Simulation and Expected-loss Search. The majority of global optimisation approaches in use are myopic, in only considering the impact of the next function value; the non-myopic approaches that do exist are able to consider only a handful of future evaluations. Our novel algorithm, GLASSES, permits the consideration of dozens of evaluations into the future. This is done by approximating the ideal look-ahead loss function, which is expensive to evaluate, by a cheaper alternative in which the future steps of the algorithm are simulated beforehand. An Expectation Propagation algorithm is used to compute the expected value of the loss.We show that the far-horizon planning thus enabled leads to substantive performance gains in empirical tests."}
{"text": "Inventory control with unknown demand distribution is considered, with emphasis placed on the case involving discrete nonperishable items. We focus on an adaptive policy which in every period uses, as much as possible, the optimal newsvendor ordering quantity for the empirical distribution learned up to that period. The policy is assessed using the regret criterion, which measures the price paid for ambiguity on demand distribution over $T$ periods. When there are guarantees on the latter's separation from the critical newsvendor parameter $\\beta=b/(h+b)$, a constant upper bound on regret can be found. Without any prior information on the demand distribution, we show that the regret does not grow faster than the rate $T^{1/2+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. In view of a known lower bound, this is almost the best one could hope for. Simulation studies involving this along with other policies are also conducted."}
{"text": "We present tree- and list- structured density estimation methods for high dimensional binary/categorical data. Our density estimation models are high dimensional analogies to variable bin width histograms. In each leaf of the tree (or list), the density is constant, similar to the flat density within the bin of a histogram. Histograms, however, cannot easily be visualized in higher dimensions, whereas our models can. The accuracy of histograms fades as dimensions increase, whereas our models have priors that help with generalization. Our models are sparse, unlike high-dimensional histograms. We present three generative models, where the first one allows the user to specify the number of desired leaves in the tree within a Bayesian prior. The second model allows the user to specify the desired number of branches within the prior. The third model returns lists (rather than trees) and allows the user to specify the desired number of rules and the length of rules within the prior. Our results indicate that the new approaches yield a better balance between sparsity and accuracy of density estimates than other methods for this task."}
{"text": "Estimating the strength of dependency between two variables is fundamental for exploratory analysis and many other applications in data mining. For example: non-linear dependencies between two continuous variables can be explored with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC); and categorical variables that are dependent to the target class are selected using Gini gain in random forests. Nonetheless, because dependency measures are estimated on finite samples, the interpretability of their quantification and the accuracy when ranking dependencies become challenging. Dependency estimates are not equal to 0 when variables are independent, cannot be compared if computed on different sample size, and they are inflated by chance on variables with more categories. In this paper, we propose a framework to adjust dependency measure estimates on finite samples. Our adjustments, which are simple and applicable to any dependency measure, are helpful in improving interpretability when quantifying dependency and in improving accuracy on the task of ranking dependencies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the interpretability of MIC when used as a proxy for the amount of noise between variables, and to gain accuracy when ranking variables during the splitting procedure in random forests."}
{"text": "We present Blitzkriging, a new approach to fast inference for Gaussian processes, applicable to regression, optimisation and classification. State-of-the-art (stochastic) inference for Gaussian processes on very large datasets scales cubically in the number of 'inducing inputs', variables introduced to factorise the model. Blitzkriging shares state-of-the-art scaling with data, but reduces the scaling in the number of inducing points to approximately linear. Further, in contrast to other methods, Blitzkriging: does not force the data to conform to any particular structure (including grid-like); reduces reliance on error-prone optimisation of inducing point locations; and is able to learn rich (covariance) structure from the data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on real data in regression, time-series prediction and signal-interpolation experiments."}
{"text": "Laplacian Eigenvectors of the graph constructed from a data set are used in many spectral manifold learning algorithms such as diffusion maps and spectral clustering. Given a graph constructed from a random sample of a $d$-dimensional compact submanifold $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, we establish the spectral convergence rate of the graph Laplacian. It implies the consistency of the spectral clustering algorithm via a standard perturbation argument. A simple numerical study indicates the necessity of a denoising step before applying spectral algorithms."}
{"text": "Kernel methods obtain superb performance in terms of accuracy for various machine learning tasks since they can effectively extract nonlinear relations. However, their time complexity can be rather large especially for clustering tasks. In this paper we define a general class of kernels that can be easily approximated by randomization. These kernels appear in various applications, in particular, traditional spectral clustering, landmark-based spectral clustering and landmark-based subspace clustering. We show that for $n$ data points from $K$ clusters with $D$ landmarks, the randomization procedure results in an algorithm of complexity $O(KnD)$. Furthermore, we bound the error between the original clustering scheme and its randomization. To illustrate the power of this framework, we propose a new fast landmark subspace (FLS) clustering algorithm. Experiments over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FLS in accelerating subspace clustering with marginal sacrifice of accuracy."}
{"text": "Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are popular tools for studying network structures. However, many modern applications such as gene network discovery and social interactions analysis often involve high-dimensional noisy data with outliers or heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose the Trimmed Graphical Lasso for robust estimation of sparse GGMs. Our method guards against outliers by an implicit trimming mechanism akin to the popular Least Trimmed Squares method used for linear regression. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of our estimator in the high-dimensional setting. In contrast, existing approaches for robust sparse GGMs estimation lack statistical guarantees. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on simulated and real gene expression data which further demonstrate the value of our approach."}
{"text": "In this paper we study nonconvex penalization using Bernstein functions whose first-order derivatives are completely monotone. The Bernstein function can induce a class of nonconvex penalty functions for high-dimensional sparse estimation problems. We derive a thresholding function based on the Bernstein penalty and discuss some important mathematical properties in sparsity modeling. We show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for regression problems penalized by the Bernstein function. We also consider the application of the Bernstein penalty in classification problems and devise a proximal alternating linearized minimization method. Based on theory of the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality, we conduct convergence analysis of these alternating iteration procedures. We particularly exemplify a family of Bernstein nonconvex penalties based on a generalized Gamma measure and conduct empirical analysis for this family."}
{"text": "Dimensionality reduction methods are very common in the field of high dimensional data analysis. Typically, algorithms for dimensionality reduction are computationally expensive. Therefore, their applications for the analysis of massive amounts of data are impractical. For example, repeated computations due to accumulated data are computationally prohibitive. In this paper, an out-of-sample extension scheme, which is used as a complementary method for dimensionality reduction, is presented. We describe an algorithm which performs an out-of-sample extension to newly-arrived data points. Unlike other extension algorithms such as Nystr\\\"om algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses the intrinsic geometry of the data and properties for dimensionality reduction map. We prove that the error of the proposed algorithm is bounded. Additionally to the out-of-sample extension, the algorithm provides a degree of the abnormality of any newly-arrived data point."}
{"text": "In life sciences, the experts generally use empirical knowledge to recode variables, choose interactions and perform selection by classical approach. The aim of this work is to perform automatic learning algorithm for variables selection which can lead to know if experts can be help in they decision or simply replaced by the machine and improve they knowledge and results. The Lasso method can detect the optimal subset of variables for estimation and prediction under some conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which uses automatically all variables available and all interactions. By a double cross-validation combine with Lasso, we select a best subset of variables and with GLM through a simple cross-validation perform predictions. The algorithm assures the stability and the the consistency of estimators."}
{"text": "Currently, machine learning plays an important role in the lives and individual activities of numerous people. Accordingly, it has become necessary to design machine learning algorithms to ensure that discrimination, biased views, or unfair treatment do not result from decision making or predictions made via machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework for supervised learning, neutralized ERM (NERM) that ensures that any classifiers obtained can be guaranteed to be neutral with respect to a viewpoint hypothesis. More specifically, given a viewpoint hypothesis, NERM works to find a target hypothesis that minimizes the empirical risk while simultaneously identifying a target hypothesis that is neutral to the viewpoint hypothesis. Within the NERM framework, we derive a theoretical bound on empirical and generalization neutrality risks. Furthermore, as a realization of NERM with linear classification, we derive a max-margin algorithm, neutral support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that our neutral SVM shows improved classification performance in real datasets without sacrificing the neutrality guarantee."}
{"text": "We propose a framework to perform streaming covariance selection. Our approach employs regularization constraints where a time-varying sparsity parameter is iteratively estimated via stochastic gradient descent. This allows for the regularization parameter to be efficiently learnt in an online manner. The proposed framework is developed for linear regression models and extended to graphical models via neighbourhood selection. Under mild assumptions, we are able to obtain convergence results in a non-stochastic setting. The capabilities of such an approach are demonstrated using both synthetic data as well as neuroimaging data."}
{"text": "Learning a causal effect from observational data is not straightforward, as this is not possible without further assumptions. If hidden common causes between treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$ cannot be blocked by other measurements, one possibility is to use an instrumental variable. In principle, it is possible under some assumptions to discover whether a variable is structurally instrumental to a target causal effect $X \\rightarrow Y$, but current frameworks are somewhat lacking on how general these assumptions can be. A instrumental variable discovery problem is challenging, as no variable can be tested as an instrument in isolation but only in groups, but different variables might require different conditions to be considered an instrument. Moreover, identification constraints might be hard to detect statistically. In this paper, we give a theoretical characterization of instrumental variable discovery, highlighting identifiability problems and solutions, the need for non-Gaussianity assumptions, and how they fit within existing methods."}
{"text": "Black-box alpha (BB-$\\alpha$) is a new approximate inference method based on the minimization of $\\alpha$-divergences. BB-$\\alpha$ scales to large datasets because it can be implemented using stochastic gradient descent. BB-$\\alpha$ can be applied to complex probabilistic models with little effort since it only requires as input the likelihood function and its gradients. These gradients can be easily obtained using automatic differentiation. By changing the divergence parameter $\\alpha$, the method is able to interpolate between variational Bayes (VB) ($\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$) and an algorithm similar to expectation propagation (EP) ($\\alpha = 1$). Experiments on probit regression and neural network regression and classification problems show that BB-$\\alpha$ with non-standard settings of $\\alpha$, such as $\\alpha = 0.5$, usually produces better predictions than with $\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$ (VB) or $\\alpha = 1$ (EP)."}
{"text": "A method for large scale Gaussian process classification has been recently proposed based on expectation propagation (EP). Such a method allows Gaussian process classifiers to be trained on very large datasets that were out of the reach of previous deployments of EP and has been shown to be competitive with related techniques based on stochastic variational inference. Nevertheless, the memory resources required scale linearly with the dataset size, unlike in variational methods. This is a severe limitation when the number of instances is very large. Here we show that this problem is avoided when stochastic EP is used to train the model."}
{"text": "Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations of Gaussian processes (GPs) and are formally equivalent to neural networks with multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are probabilistic and non-parametric and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to generalise, and provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than alternative deep models. The focus of this paper is scalable approximate Bayesian learning of these networks. The paper develops a novel and efficient extension of probabilistic backpropagation, a state-of-the-art method for training Bayesian neural networks, that can be used to train DGPs. The new method leverages a recently proposed method for scaling Expectation Propagation, called stochastic Expectation Propagation. The method is able to automatically discover useful input warping, expansion or compression, and it is therefore is a flexible form of Bayesian kernel design. We demonstrate the success of the new method for supervised learning on several real-world datasets, showing that it typically outperforms GP regression and is never much worse."}
{"text": "Supervised learning is an active research area, with numerous applications in diverse fields such as data analytics, computer vision, speech and audio processing, and image understanding. In most cases, the loss functions used in machine learning assume symmetric noise models, and seek to estimate the unknown function parameters. However, loss functions such as quantile and quantile Huber generalize the symmetric $\\ell_1$ and Huber losses to the asymmetric setting, for a fixed quantile parameter. In this paper, we propose to jointly infer the quantile parameter and the unknown function parameters, for the asymmetric quantile Huber and quantile losses. We explore various properties of the quantile Huber loss and implement a convexity certificate that can be used to check convexity in the quantile parameter. When the loss if convex with respect to the parameter of the function, we prove that it is biconvex in both the function and the quantile parameters, and propose an algorithm to jointly estimate these. Results with synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically recover the quantile parameter corresponding to the noise and also provide an improved recovery of function parameters. To illustrate the potential of the framework, we extend the gradient boosting machines with quantile losses to automatically estimate the quantile parameter at each iteration."}
{"text": "For regular particle filter algorithm or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, the initial weights are traditionally dependent on the proposed distribution, the posterior distribution at the current timestamp in the sampled sequence, and the target is the posterior distribution of the previous timestamp. This is technically correct, but leads to algorithms which usually have practical issues with degeneracy, where all particles eventually collapse onto a single particle. In this paper, we propose and evaluate using $k$ means clustering to attack and even take advantage of this degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a Stochastic SMC algorithm which initializes the set of $k$ means, providing the initial centers chosen from the collapsed particles. To fight against degeneracy, we adjust the regular SMC weights, mediated by cluster proportions, and then correct them to retain the same expectation as before. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach has better performance than vanilla algorithms."}
{"text": "We compute approximate solutions to L0 regularized linear regression using L1 regularization, also known as the Lasso, as an initialization step. Our algorithm, the Lass-0 (\"Lass-zero\"), uses a computationally efficient stepwise search to determine a locally optimal L0 solution given any L1 regularization solution. We present theoretical results of consistency under orthogonality and appropriate handling of redundant features. Empirically, we use synthetic data to demonstrate that Lass-0 solutions are closer to the true sparse support than L1 regularization models. Additionally, in real-world data Lass-0 finds more parsimonious solutions than L1 regularization while maintaining similar predictive accuracy."}
{"text": "We present a scalable Gaussian process model for identifying and characterizing smooth multidimensional changepoints, and automatically learning changes in expressive covariance structure. We use Random Kitchen Sink features to flexibly define a change surface in combination with expressive spectral mixture kernels to capture the complex statistical structure. Finally, through the use of novel methods for additive non-separable kernels, we can scale the model to large datasets. We demonstrate the model on numerical and real world data, including a large spatio-temporal disease dataset where we identify previously unknown heterogeneous changes in space and time."}
{"text": "We present a convex approach to probabilistic segmentation and modeling of time series data. Our approach builds upon recent advances in multivariate total variation regularization, and seeks to learn a separate set of parameters for the distribution over the observations at each time point, but with an additional penalty that encourages the parameters to remain constant over time. We propose efficient optimization methods for solving the resulting (large) optimization problems, and a two-stage procedure for estimating recurring clusters under such models, based upon kernel density estimation. Finally, we show on a number of real-world segmentation tasks, the resulting methods often perform as well or better than existing latent variable models, while being substantially easier to train."}
{"text": "We present PESMO, a Bayesian method for identifying the Pareto set of multi-objective optimization problems, when the functions are expensive to evaluate. The central idea of PESMO is to choose evaluation points so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the posterior distribution over the Pareto set. Critically, the PESMO multi-objective acquisition function can be decomposed as a sum of objective-specific acquisition functions, which enables the algorithm to be used in \\emph{decoupled} scenarios in which the objectives can be evaluated separately and perhaps with different costs. This decoupling capability also makes it possible to identify difficult objectives that require more evaluations. PESMO also offers gains in efficiency, as its cost scales linearly with the number of objectives, in comparison to the exponential cost of other methods. We compare PESMO with other related methods for multi-objective Bayesian optimization on synthetic and real-world problems. The results show that PESMO produces better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations of the objectives, and that a decoupled evaluation can lead to improvements in performance, particularly when the number of objectives is large."}
{"text": "In clinical and neuroscientific studies, systematic differences between two populations of brain networks are investigated in order to characterize mental diseases or processes. Those networks are usually represented as graphs built from neuroimaging data and studied by means of graph analysis methods. The typical machine learning approach to study these brain graphs creates a classifier and tests its ability to discriminate the two populations. In contrast to this approach, in this work we propose to directly test whether two populations of graphs are different or not, by using the kernel two-sample test (KTST), without creating the intermediate classifier. We claim that, in general, the two approaches provides similar results and that the KTST requires much less computation. Additionally, in the regime of low sample size, we claim that the KTST has lower frequency of Type II error than the classification approach. Besides providing algorithmic considerations to support these claims, we show strong evidence through experiments and one simulation."}
{"text": "In some speaker recognition scenarios we find conversations recorded simultaneously over multiple channels. That is the case of the interviews in the NIST SRE dataset. To take advantage of that, we propose a modification of the PLDA model that considers two different inter-session variability terms. The first term is tied between all the recordings belonging to the same conversation whereas the second is not. Thus, the former mainly intends to capture the variability due to the phonetic content of the conversation while the latter tries to capture the channel variability. In this document, we derive the equations for this model. This model was applied in the paper \"Handling Recordings Acquired Simultaneously over Multiple Channels with PLDA\" published at Interspeech 2013."}
{"text": "We consider convex-concave saddle point problems with a separable structure and non-strongly convex functions. We propose an efficient stochastic block coordinate descent method using adaptive primal-dual updates, which enables flexible parallel optimization for large-scale problems. Our method shares the efficiency and flexibility of block coordinate descent methods with the simplicity of primal-dual methods and utilizing the structure of the separable convex-concave saddle point problem. It is capable of solving a wide range of machine learning applications, including robust principal component analysis, Lasso, and feature selection by group Lasso, etc. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods in all these applications."}
{"text": "In this document we are going to derive the equations needed to implement a Variational Bayes estimation of the parameters of the simplified probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (SPLDA) model.

{"text": "Latent variable time-series models are among the most heavily used tools from machine learning and applied statistics. These models have the advantage of learning latent structure both from noisy observations and from the temporal ordering in the data, where it is assumed that meaningful correlation structure exists across time. A few highly-structured models, such as the linear dynamical system with linear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference procedures (e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the general rule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models is intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling focuses on approximate inference procedures for one particular class of models. Here, we extend recent developments in stochastic variational inference to develop a `black-box' approximate inference technique for latent variable models with latent dynamical structure. We propose a structured Gaussian variational approximate posterior that carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman filter-smoother but, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach to approximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent variable generative models. We show that our approach recovers accurate estimates in the case of basic models with closed-form posteriors, and more interestingly performs well in comparison to variational approaches that were designed in a bespoke fashion for specific non-conjugate models."}
{"text": "State-of-the-art speaker recognition relays on models that need a large amount of training data. This models are successful in tasks like NIST SRE because there is sufficient data available. However, in real applications, we usually do not have so much data and, in many cases, the speaker labels are unknown. We present a method to adapt a PLDA model from a domain with a large amount of labeled data to another with unlabeled data. We describe a generative model that produces both sets of data where the unknown labels are modeled like latent variables. We used variational Bayes to estimate the hidden variables. Here, we derive the equations for this model. This model has been used in the papers: \"UNSUPERVISED ADAPTATION OF PLDA BY USING VARIATIONAL BAYES METHODS\" publised at ICASSP 2014, \"Unsupervised Training of PLDA with Variational Bayes\" published at Iberspeech 2014, and \"VARIATIONAL BAYESIAN PLDA FOR SPEAKER DIARIZATION IN THE MGB CHALLENGE\" published at ASRU 2015."}

{"text": "Distance-based hierarchical clustering (HC) methods are widely used in unsupervised data analysis but few authors take account of uncertainty in the distance data. We incorporate a statistical model of the uncertainty through corruption or noise in the pairwise distances and investigate the problem of estimating the HC as unknown parameters from measurements. Specifically, we focus on single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) and study its geometry. We prove that under fairly reasonable conditions on the probability distribution governing measurements, SLHC is equivalent to maximum partial profile likelihood estimation (MPPLE) with some of the information contained in the data ignored. At the same time, we show that direct evaluation of SLHC on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of pairwise distances yields a consistent estimator. Consequently, a full MLE is expected to perform better than SLHC in getting the correct HC results for the ground truth metric."}
{"text": "We derive a statistical model for estimation of a dendrogram from single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) that takes account of uncertainty through noise or corruption in the measurements of separation of data. Our focus is on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this \"dendrogram structure'' is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described. These ideas are illustrated by a simple Monte Carlo simulation that, at least for small data sets, suggests the method outperforms SLHC in the presence of noise."}
{"text": "This paper aims at achieving a \"good\" estimator for the gradient of a function on a high-dimensional space. Often such functions are not sensitive in all coordinates and the gradient of the function is almost sparse. We propose a method for gradient estimation that combines ideas from Spall's Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation with compressive sensing. The aim is to obtain \"good\" estimator without too many function evaluations. Application to estimating gradient outer product matrix as well as standard optimization problems are illustrated via simulations."}
{"text": "We present an information-theoretic framework for solving global black-box optimization problems that also have black-box constraints. Of particular interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the constraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic and real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require balancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of PESC and in the actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality approach and develop partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization."}
{"text": "The understanding of the type of inhibitory interaction plays an important role in drug design. Therefore, researchers are interested to know whether a drug has competitive or non-competitive interaction to particular protein targets.   Method: to analyze the interaction types we propose factorization method Macau which allows us to combine different measurement types into a single tensor together with proteins and compounds. The compounds are characterized by high dimensional 2D ECFP fingerprints. The novelty of the proposed method is that using a specially designed noise injection MCMC sampler it can incorporate high dimensional side information, i.e., millions of unique 2D ECFP compound features, even for large scale datasets of millions of compounds. Without the side information, in this case, the tensor factorization would be practically futile.   Results: using public IC50 and Ki data from ChEMBL we trained a model from where we can identify the latent subspace separating the two measurement types (IC50 and Ki). The results suggest the proposed method can detect the competitive inhibitory activity between compounds and proteins."}
{"text": "Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters."}
{"text": "Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm for hidden Markov models, in a sequential data setting. Given a collapsed hidden Markov Model, we break its long Markov chain into a set of short subchains. We propose a novel sum-product algorithm to update the posteriors of the subchains, taking into account their boundary transitions due to the sequential dependencies. Our experiments on two discrete datasets show that our collapsed algorithm is scalable to very large datasets, memory efficient and significantly more accurate than the existing uncollapsed algorithm."}
{"text": "Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm in the sequential data setting. Our algorithm is applicable to both finite hidden Markov models and hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov models, and to any datasets generated by emission distributions in the exponential family. Our experiment results on two discrete datasets show that our inference is both more efficient and more accurate than its uncollapsed version, stochastic variational inference."}
{"text": "In neuroimaging data analysis, Gaussian graphical models are often used to model statistical dependencies across spatially remote brain regions known as functional connectivity. Typically, data is collected across a cohort of subjects and the scientific objectives consist of estimating population and subject-specific graphical models. A third objective that is often overlooked involves quantifying inter-subject variability and thus identifying regions or sub-networks that demonstrate heterogeneity across subjects. Such information is fundamental in order to thoroughly understand the human connectome. We propose Mixed Neighborhood Selection in order to simultaneously address the three aforementioned objectives. By recasting covariance selection as a neighborhood selection problem we are able to efficiently learn the topology of each node. We introduce an additional mixed effect component to neighborhood selection in order to simultaneously estimate a graphical model for the population of subjects as well as for each individual subject. The proposed method is validated empirically through a series of simulations and applied to resting state data for healthy subjects taken from the ABIDE consortium."}
{"text": "We investigate a class of feature allocation models that generalize the Indian buffet process and are parameterized by Gibbs-type random measures. Two existing classes are contained as special cases: the original two-parameter Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Dirichlet process, and the stable (or three-parameter) Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Pitman--Yor process. Asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs-type partitions, such as power laws holding for the number of latent clusters, translates into analogous characteristics for this class of Gibbs-type feature allocation models. Despite containing several different distinct subclasses, the properties of Gibbs-type partitions allow us to develop a black-box procedure for posterior inference within any subclass of models. Through numerical experiments, we compare and contrast a few of these subclasses and highlight the utility of varying power-law behaviors in the latent features."}
{"text": "Topic models are popular for modeling discrete data (e.g., texts, images, videos, links), and provide an efficient way to discover hidden structures/semantics in massive data. One of the core problems in this field is the posterior inference for individual data instances. This problem is particularly important in streaming environments, but is often intractable. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) for recovering sparse solutions to posterior inference. From detailed elucidation of both theoretical and practical aspects, FW exhibits many interesting properties which are beneficial to topic modeling. We then employ FW to design fast methods, including ML-FW, for learning latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) at large scales. Extensive experiments show that to reach the same predictiveness level, ML-FW can perform tens to thousand times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods for learning LDA from massive/streaming data."}
{"text": "One of the core problems in statistical models is the estimation of a posterior distribution. For topic models, the problem of posterior inference for individual texts is particularly important, especially when dealing with data streams, but is often intractable in the worst case. As a consequence, existing methods for posterior inference are approximate and do not have any guarantee on neither quality nor convergence rate. In this paper, we introduce a provably fast algorithm, namely Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (OPE), for posterior inference in topic models. OPE has more attractive properties than existing inference approaches, including theoretical guarantees on quality and fast rate of convergence to a local maximal/stationary point of the inference problem. The discussions about OPE are very general and hence can be easily employed in a wide range of contexts. Finally, we employ OPE to design three methods for learning Latent Dirichlet Allocation from text streams or large corpora. Extensive experiments demonstrate some superior behaviors of OPE and of our new learning methods."}
{"text": "Recursive partitioning approaches producing tree-like models are a long standing staple of predictive modeling, in the last decade mostly as ``sub-learners'' within state of the art ensemble methods like Boosting and Random Forest. However, a fundamental flaw in the partitioning (or splitting) rule of commonly used tree building methods precludes them from treating different types of variables equally. This most clearly manifests in these methods' inability to properly utilize categorical variables with a large number of categories, which are ubiquitous in the new age of big data. Such variables can often be very informative, but current tree methods essentially leave us a choice of either not using them, or exposing our models to severe overfitting. We propose a conceptual framework to splitting using leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation for selecting the splitting variable, then performing a regular split (in our case, following CART's approach) for the selected variable. The most important consequence of our approach is that categorical variables with many categories can be safely used in tree building and are only chosen if they contribute to predictive power. We demonstrate in extensive simulation and real data analysis that our novel splitting approach significantly improves the performance of both single tree models and ensemble methods that utilize trees. Importantly, we design an algorithm for LOO splitting variable selection which under reasonable assumptions does not increase the overall computational complexity compared to CART for two-class classification. For regression tasks, our approach carries an increased computational burden, replacing a O(log(n)) factor in CART splitting rule search with an O(n) term."}
{"text": "The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a widely used random graph model for networks with communities. Despite the recent burst of interest in recovering communities in the SBM from statistical and computational points of view, there are still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic and computational limits of recovery. In this paper, we consider the SBM in its full generality, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of communities or how they grow with the number of nodes, as well as on the connection probabilities inside or across communities. This generality allows us to move past the artifacts of homogenous SBM, and understand the right parameters (such as the relative densities of communities) that define the various recovery thresholds. We outline the implications of our generalizations via a set of illustrative examples. For instance, $\\log n$ is considered to be the standard lower bound on the cluster size for exact recovery via convex methods, for homogenous SBM. We show that it is possible, in the right circumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the cluster, the denser), to recover very small clusters (up to $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ size), if there are just a few of them (at most polylogarithmic in $n$)."}
{"text": "When learning a hidden Markov model (HMM), sequen- tial observations can often be complemented by real-valued summary response variables generated from the path of hid- den states. Such settings arise in numerous domains, includ- ing many applications in biology, like motif discovery and genome annotation. In this paper, we present a flexible frame- work for jointly modeling both latent sequence features and the functional mapping that relates the summary response variables to the hidden state sequence. The algorithm is com- patible with a rich set of mapping functions. Results show that the availability of additional continuous response vari- ables can simultaneously improve the annotation of the se- quential observations and yield good prediction performance in both synthetic data and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) stand at the forefront of many recent developments in deep learning. Yet a major difficulty with these models is their tendency to overfit, with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers. Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning."}
{"text": "Causal inference deals with identifying which random variables \"cause\" or control other random variables. Recent advances on the topic of causal inference based on tools from statistical estimation and machine learning have resulted in practical algorithms for causal inference. Causal inference has the potential to have significant impact on medical research, prevention and control of diseases, and identifying factors that impact economic changes to name just a few. However, these promising applications for causal inference are often ones that involve sensitive or personal data of users that need to be kept private (e.g., medical records, personal finances, etc). Therefore, there is a need for the development of causal inference methods that preserve data privacy. We study the problem of inferring causality using the current, popular causal inference framework, the additive noise model (ANM) while simultaneously ensuring privacy of the users. Our framework provides differential privacy guarantees for a variety of ANM variants. We run extensive experiments, and demonstrate that our techniques are practical and easy to implement."}
{"text": "We propose a novel classification model for weak signal data, building upon a recent model for Bayesian multi-view learning, Group Factor Analysis (GFA). Instead of assuming all data to come from a single GFA model, we allow latent clusters, each having a different GFA model and producing a different class distribution. We show that sharing information across the clusters, by sharing factors, increases the classification accuracy considerably; the shared factors essentially form a flexible noise model that explains away the part of data not related to classification. Motivation for the setting comes from single-trial functional brain imaging data, having a very low signal-to-noise ratio and a natural multi-view setting, with the different sensors, measurement modalities (EEG, MEG, fMRI) and possible auxiliary information as views. We demonstrate our model on a MEG dataset."}
{"text": "We investigate properties of estimators obtained by minimization of U-processes with the Lasso penalty in high-dimensional settings. Our attention is focused on the ranking problem that is popular in machine learning. It is related to guessing the ordering between objects on the basis of their observed predictors.

{"text": "We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the posterior measure over the trajec- tories of a diffusion process from discrete time observations and continuous time constraints. We cast the problem in a Bayesian framework and derive approximations to the posterior distributions of single time marginals using variational approximate inference. We then show how the approximation can be extended to a wide class of discrete-state Markov jump pro- cesses by making use of the chemical Langevin equation. Our empirical results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides good approximations for these classes of inverse problems."}
{"text": "We show that the objective function of conventional k-means clustering can be expressed as the Frobenius norm of the difference of a data matrix and a low rank approximation of that data matrix.

{"text": "Learning in deep models using Bayesian methods has generated significant attention recently. This is largely because of the feasibility of modern Bayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a measure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for large-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient thermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a thermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior distributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion increases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so better use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use of an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the traditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more accurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be desirable in Bayesian deep learning. Extensive experiments on two canonical models and their deep extensions demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves general Bayesian posterior sampling, particularly for deep models."}
{"text": "Effective training of deep neural networks suffers from two main issues. The first is that the parameter spaces of these models exhibit pathological curvature. Recent methods address this problem by using adaptive preconditioning for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These methods improve convergence by adapting to the local geometry of parameter space. A second issue is overfitting, which is typically addressed by early stopping. However, recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian model averaging mitigates this problem. The posterior can be sampled by using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). However, the rapidly changing curvature renders default SGLD methods inefficient. Here, we propose combining adaptive preconditioners with SGLD. In support of this idea, we give theoretical properties on asymptotic convergence and predictive risk. We also provide empirical results for Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Nets, and Convolutional Neural Nets, demonstrating that our preconditioned SGLD method gives state-of-the-art performance on these models."}
{"text": "The histogram method is a powerful non-parametric approach for estimating the probability density function of a continuous variable. But the construction of a histogram, compared to the parametric approaches, demands a large number of observations to capture the underlying density function. Thus it is not suitable for analyzing a sparse data set, a collection of units with a small size of data. In this paper, by employing the probabilistic topic model, we develop a novel Bayesian approach to alleviating the sparsity problem in the conventional histogram estimation. Our method estimates a unit's density function as a mixture of basis histograms, in which the number of bins for each basis, as well as their heights, is determined automatically. The estimation procedure is performed by using the fast and easy-to-implement collapsed Gibbs sampling. We apply the proposed method to synthetic data, showing that it performs well."}
{"text": "We propose a novel class of time-varying nonparanormal graphical models, which allows us to model high dimensional heavy-tailed systems and the evolution of their latent network structures. Under this model, we develop statistical tests for presence of edges both locally at a fixed index value and globally over a range of values. The tests are developed for a high-dimensional regime, are robust to model selection mistakes and do not require commonly assumed minimum signal strength. The testing procedures are based on a high dimensional, debiasing-free moment estimator, which uses a novel kernel smoothed Kendall's tau correlation matrix as an input statistic. The estimator consistently estimates the latent inverse Pearson correlation matrix uniformly in both the index variable and kernel bandwidth. Its rate of convergence is shown to be minimax optimal. Our method is supported by thorough numerical simulations and an application to a neural imaging data set."}
{"text": "Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso, whose distribution can be characterized in an efficient manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism."}
{"text": "In compressed sensing, in order to recover a sparse or nearly sparse vector from possibly noisy measurements, the most popular approach is $\\ell_1$-norm minimization. Upper bounds for the $\\ell_2$- norm of the error between the true and estimated vectors are given in [1] and reviewed in [2], while bounds for the $\\ell_1$-norm are given in [3]. When the unknown vector is not conventionally sparse but is \"group sparse\" instead, a variety of alternatives to the $\\ell_1$-norm have been proposed in the literature, including the group LASSO, sparse group LASSO, and group LASSO with tree structured overlapping groups. However, no error bounds are available for any of these modified objective functions. In the present paper, a unified approach is presented for deriving upper bounds on the error between the true vector and its approximation, based on the notion of decomposable and $\\gamma$-decomposable norms. The bounds presented cover all of the norms mentioned above, and also provide a guideline for choosing norms in future to accommodate alternate forms of sparsity."}
{"text": "We study the fundamental tradeoffs between computational tractability and statistical accuracy for a general family of hypothesis testing problems with combinatorial structures. Based upon an oracle model of computation, which captures the interactions between algorithms and data, we establish a general lower bound that explicitly connects the minimum testing risk under computational budget constraints with the intrinsic probabilistic and combinatorial structures of statistical problems. This lower bound mirrors the classical statistical lower bound by Le Cam (1986) and allows us to quantify the optimal statistical performance achievable given limited computational budgets in a systematic fashion. Under this unified framework, we sharply characterize the statistical-computational phase transition for two testing problems, namely, normal mean detection and sparse principal component detection. For normal mean detection, we consider two combinatorial structures, namely, sparse set and perfect matching. For these problems we identify significant gaps between the optimal statistical accuracy that is achievable under computational tractability constraints and the classical statistical lower bounds. Compared with existing works on computational lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms on Turing machines, and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection, we focus on the oracle computational model, which covers a broad range of popular algorithms, and do not rely on unproven hypotheses. Moreover, our result provides an intuitive and concrete interpretation for the intrinsic computational intractability of high-dimensional statistical problems. One byproduct of our result is a lower bound for a strict generalization of the matrix permanent problem, which is of independent interest."}
{"text": "We introduce a general framework for estimation of inverse covariance, or precision, matrices from heterogeneous populations. The proposed framework uses a Laplacian shrinkage penalty to encourage similarity among estimates from disparate, but related, subpopulations, while allowing for differences among matrices. We propose an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for parameter estimation, as well as its extension for faster computation in high dimensions by thresholding the empirical covariance matrix to identify the joint block diagonal structure in the estimated precision matrices. We establish both variable selection and norm consistency of the proposed estimator for distributions with exponential or polynomial tails. Further, to extend the applicability of the method to the settings with unknown populations structure, we propose a Laplacian penalty based on hierarchical clustering, and discuss conditions under which this data-driven choice results in consistent estimation of precision matrices in heterogenous populations. Extensive numerical studies and applications to gene expression data from subtypes of cancer with distinct clinical outcomes indicate the potential advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches."}
{"text": "The aim of this paper is to provide a new method for learning the relationships between data that have been obtained independently. Unlike existing methods like matching, the proposed technique does not require any contextual information, provided that the dependency between the variables of interest is monotone. It can therefore be easily combined with matching in order to exploit the advantages of both methods. This technique can be described as a mix between quantile matching, and deconvolution. We provide for it a theoretical and an empirical validation."}
{"text": "This paper is about index policies for minimizing (frequentist) regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit model, inspired by a Bayesian view on the problem. Our main contribution is to prove that the Bayes-UCB algorithm, which relies on quantiles of posterior distributions, is asymptotically optimal when the reward distributions belong to a one-dimensional exponential family, for a large class of prior distributions. We also show that the Bayesian literature gives new insight on what kind of exploration rates could be used in frequentist, UCB-type algorithms. Indeed, approximations of the Bayesian optimal solution or the Finite Horizon Gittins indices provide a justification for the kl-UCB+ and kl-UCB-H+ algorithms, whose asymptotic optimality is also established."}
{"text": "In this paper, a novel approach for coding nominal data is proposed. For the given nominal data, a rank in a form of complex number is assigned. The proposed method does not lose any information about the attribute and brings other properties previously unknown. The approach based on these knew properties can been used for classification. The analyzed example shows that classification with the use of coded nominal data or both numerical as well as coded nominal data is more effective than the classification, which uses only numerical data."}
{"text": "For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual's disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual's disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions--the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy."}
{"text": "We present a method of variable selection for the sparse generalized additive model. The method doesn't assume any specific functional form, and can select from a large number of candidates. It takes the form of incremental forward stagewise regression. Given no functional form is assumed, we devised an approach termed roughening to adjust the residuals in the iterations. In simulations, we show the new method is competitive against popular machine learning approaches. We also demonstrate its performance using some real datasets. The method is available as a part of the nlnet package on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=nlnet."}
{"text": "Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is aimed at identifying a linear subspace such that the projected data follows a non-Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel NGCA algorithm based on log-density gradient estimation. Unlike existing methods, the proposed NGCA algorithm identifies the linear subspace by using the eigenvalue decomposition without any iterative procedures, and thus is computationally reasonable. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we prove that the identified subspace converges to the true subspace at the optimal parametric rate. Finally, the practical performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on both artificial and benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "This paper presents a new framework for manifold learning based on a sequence of principal polynomials that capture the possibly nonlinear nature of the data. The proposed Principal Polynomial Analysis (PPA) generalizes PCA by modeling the directions of maximal variance by means of curves, instead of straight lines. Contrarily to previous approaches, PPA reduces to performing simple univariate regressions, which makes it computationally feasible and robust. Moreover, PPA shows a number of interesting analytical properties. First, PPA is a volume-preserving map, which in turn guarantees the existence of the inverse. Second, such an inverse can be obtained in closed form. Invertibility is an important advantage over other learning methods, because it permits to understand the identified features in the input domain where the data has physical meaning. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the performance of dimensionality reduction in sensible (input-domain) units. Volume preservation also allows an easy computation of information theoretic quantities, such as the reduction in multi-information after the transform. Third, the analytical nature of PPA leads to a clear geometrical interpretation of the manifold: it allows the computation of Frenet-Serret frames (local features) and of generalized curvatures at any point of the space. And fourth, the analytical Jacobian allows the computation of the metric induced by the data, thus generalizing the Mahalanobis distance. These properties are demonstrated theoretically and illustrated experimentally. The performance of PPA is evaluated in dimensionality and redundancy reduction, in both synthetic and real datasets from the UCI repository."}
{"text": "Most signal processing problems involve the challenging task of multidimensional probability density function (PDF) estimation. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a family of Rotation-based Iterative Gaussianization (RBIG) transforms. The general framework consists of the sequential application of a univariate marginal Gaussianization transform followed by an orthonormal transform. The proposed procedure looks for differentiable transforms to a known PDF so that the unknown PDF can be estimated at any point of the original domain. In particular, we aim at a zero mean unit covariance Gaussian for convenience. RBIG is formally similar to classical iterative Projection Pursuit (PP) algorithms. However, we show that, unlike in PP methods, the particular class of rotations used has no special qualitative relevance in this context, since looking for interestingness is not a critical issue for PDF estimation. The key difference is that our approach focuses on the univariate part (marginal Gaussianization) of the problem rather than on the multivariate part (rotation). This difference implies that one may select the most convenient rotation suited to each practical application. The differentiability, invertibility and convergence of RBIG are theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Relation to other methods, such as Radial Gaussianization (RG), one-class support vector domain description (SVDD), and deep neural networks (DNN) is also pointed out. The practical performance of RBIG is successfully illustrated in a number of multidimensional problems such as image synthesis, classification, denoising, and multi-information estimation."}
{"text": "Generating user interpretable multi-class predictions in data rich environments with many classes and explanatory covariates is a daunting task. We introduce Diagonal Orthant Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DOLDA), a supervised topic model for multi-class classification that can handle both many classes as well as many covariates. To handle many classes we use the recently proposed Diagonal Orthant (DO) probit model (Johndrow et al., 2013) together with an efficient Horseshoe prior for variable selection/shrinkage (Carvalho et al., 2010). We propose a computationally efficient parallel Gibbs sampler for the new model. An important advantage of DOLDA is that learned topics are directly connected to individual classes without the need for a reference class. We evaluate the model's predictive accuracy on two datasets and demonstrate DOLDA's advantage in interpreting the generated predictions."}

Randomized initialization with uneven weights ({\\tt k-means++}) has recently been used to improve the performance over this strategy in cost and run-time. We consider the k-means problem with semi-supervised information, where some of the data are pre-labeled, and we seek to label the rest according to the minimum cost solution. By extending the {\\tt k-means++} algorithm and analysis to account for the labels, we derive an improved theoretical bound on expected cost and observe improved performance in simulated and real data examples. This analysis provides theoretical justification for a roughly linear semi-supervised clustering algorithm."}
{"text": "Regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), proposed by Friedman (1989), is a widely popular classifier that lacks interpretability and is impractical for high-dimensional data sets. Here, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient classifier called high-dimensional RDA (HDRDA), designed for the small-sample, high-dimensional setting. For HDRDA, we show that each training observation, regardless of class, contributes to the class covariance matrix, resulting in an interpretable estimator that borrows from the pooled sample covariance matrix. Moreover, we show that HDRDA is equivalent to a classifier in a reduced-feature space with dimension approximately equal to the training sample size. As a result, the matrix operations employed by HDRDA are computationally linear in the number of features, making the classifier well-suited for high-dimensional classification in practice. We demonstrate that HDRDA is often superior to several sparse and regularized classifiers in terms of classification accuracy with three artificial and six real high-dimensional data sets. Also, timing comparisons between our HDRDA implementation in the sparsediscrim R package and the standard RDA formulation in the klaR R package demonstrate that as the number of features increases, the computational runtime of HDRDA is drastically smaller than that of RDA."}
{"text": "Hearing Aid (HA) algorithms need to be tuned (\"fitted\") to match the impairment of each specific patient. The lack of a fundamental HA fitting theory is a strong contributing factor to an unsatisfying sound experience for about 20% of hearing aid patients. This paper proposes a probabilistic modeling approach to the design of HA algorithms. The proposed method relies on a generative probabilistic model for the hearing loss problem and provides for automated inference of the corresponding (1) signal processing algorithm, (2) the fitting solution as well as a principled (3) performance evaluation metric. All three tasks are realized as message passing algorithms in a factor graph representation of the generative model, which in principle allows for fast implementation on hearing aid or mobile device hardware. The methods are theoretically worked out and simulated with a custom-built factor graph toolbox for a specific hearing loss model."}
{"text": "The problem of learning a sparse model is conceptually interpreted as the process of identifying active features/samples and then optimizing the model over them. Recently introduced safe screening allows us to identify a part of non-active features/samples. So far, safe screening has been individually studied either for feature screening or for sample screening. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for safely screening features and samples simultaneously by alternatively iterating feature and sample screening steps. A significant advantage of considering them simultaneously rather than individually is that they have a synergy effect in the sense that the results of the previous safe feature screening can be exploited for improving the next safe sample screening performances, and vice-versa. We first theoretically investigate the synergy effect, and then illustrate the practical advantage through intensive numerical experiments for problems with large numbers of features and samples."}
{"text": "We propose a nonparametric statistical test for goodness-of-fit: given a set of samples, the test determines how likely it is that these were generated from a target density function. The measure of goodness-of-fit is a divergence constructed via Stein's method using functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our test statistic is based on an empirical estimate of this divergence, taking the form of a V-statistic in terms of the log gradients of the target density and the kernel. We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure. We apply our test to quantifying convergence of approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, statistical model criticism, and evaluating quality of fit vs model complexity in nonparametric density estimation."}
{"text": "Unsupervised image segmentation aims at clustering the set of pixels of an image into spatially homogeneous regions. We introduce here a class of Bayesian nonparametric models to address this problem. These models are based on a combination of a Potts-like spatial smoothness component and a prior on partitions which is used to control both the number and size of clusters. This class of models is flexible enough to include the standard Potts model and the more recent Potts-Dirichlet Process model \\cite{Orbanz2008}. More importantly, any prior on partitions can be introduced to control the global clustering structure so that it is possible to penalize small or large clusters if necessary. Bayesian computation is carried out using an original generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive in terms of RAND\\ index compared to popular image segmentation methods, such as mean-shift, and recent alternative Bayesian nonparametric models."}
{"text": "We derive a new discrepancy statistic for measuring differences between two probability distributions based on combining Stein's identity with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. We apply our result to test how well a probabilistic model fits a set of observations, and derive a new class of powerful goodness-of-fit tests that are widely applicable for complex and high dimensional distributions, even for those with computationally intractable normalization constants. Both theoretical and empirical properties of our methods are studied thoroughly."}
{"text": "Recently, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods have been proposed for scaling up Monte Carlo computations to large data problems. Whilst these approaches have proven useful in many applications, vanilla SG-MCMC might suffer from poor mixing rates when random variables exhibit strong couplings under the target densities or big scale differences. In this study, we propose a novel SG-MCMC method that takes the local geometry into account by using ideas from Quasi-Newton optimization methods. These second order methods directly approximate the inverse Hessian by using a limited history of samples and their gradients. Our method uses dense approximations of the inverse Hessian while keeping the time and memory complexities linear with the dimension of the problem. We provide a formal theoretical analysis where we show that the proposed method is asymptotically unbiased and consistent with the posterior expectations. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach on both synthetic and real datasets. Our experiments on two challenging applications show that our method achieves fast convergence rates similar to Riemannian approaches while at the same time having low computational requirements similar to diagonal preconditioning approaches."}
{"text": "Extracting the underlying low-dimensional space where high-dimensional signals often reside has long been at the center of numerous algorithms in the signal processing and machine learning literature during the past few decades. At the same time, working with incomplete (partly observed) large scale datasets has recently been commonplace for diverse reasons. This so called {\\it big data era} we are currently living calls for devising online subspace learning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data. Their envisaged objective is to {\\it recursively} estimate the unknown subspace by processing streaming data sequentially, thus reducing computational complexity, while obviating the need for storing the whole dataset in memory. In this paper, an online variational Bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations is presented. To account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace, commonly met in practice, low-rankness is explicitly imposed on the sought subspace data matrix by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning principles. Moreover, sparsity, {\\it simultaneously} to low-rankness, is favored on the subspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian scheme that is adopted. In doing so, the proposed algorithm becomes adept in dealing with applications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse, as, e.g., in sparse dictionary learning problems. As shown, the new subspace tracking scheme outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy, in a variety of experiments conducted on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "The mixture of experts (MoE) model is a popular neural network architecture for nonlinear regression and classification. The class of MoE mean functions is known to be uniformly convergent to any unknown target function, assuming that the target function is from Sobolev space that is sufficiently differentiable and that the domain of estimation is a compact unit hypercube. We provide an alternative result, which shows that the class of MoE mean functions is dense in the class of all continuous functions over arbitrary compact domains of estimation. Our result can be viewed as a universal approximation theorem for MoE models."}
{"text": "In this paper we study predictive pattern mining problems where the goal is to construct a predictive model based on a subset of predictive patterns in the database. Our main contribution is to introduce a novel method called safe pattern pruning (SPP) for a class of predictive pattern mining problems. The SPP method allows us to efficiently find a superset of all the predictive patterns in the database that are needed for the optimal predictive model. The advantage of the SPP method over existing boosting-type method is that the former can find the superset by a single search over the database, while the latter requires multiple searches. The SPP method is inspired by recent development of safe feature screening. In order to extend the idea of safe feature screening into predictive pattern mining, we derive a novel pruning rule called safe pattern pruning (SPP) rule that can be used for searching over the tree defined among patterns in the database. The SPP rule has a property that, if a node corresponding to a pattern in the database is pruned out by the SPP rule, then it is guaranteed that all the patterns corresponding to its descendant nodes are never needed for the optimal predictive model. We apply the SPP method to graph mining and item-set mining problems, and demonstrate its computational advantage."}
{"text": "Discovering statistically significant patterns from databases is an important challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in databases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically significant patterns from databases."}
{"text": "Circular variables arise in a multitude of data-modelling contexts ranging from robotics to the social sciences, but they have been largely overlooked by the machine learning community. This paper partially redresses this imbalance by extending some standard probabilistic modelling tools to the circular domain. First we introduce a new multivariate distribution over circular variables, called the multivariate Generalised von Mises (mGvM) distribution. This distribution can be constructed by restricting and renormalising a general multivariate Gaussian distribution to the unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed multivariate circular distributions are shown to be special cases of this construction. Second, we introduce a new probabilistic model for circular regression, that is inspired by Gaussian Processes, and a method for probabilistic principal component analysis with circular hidden variables. These models can leverage standard modelling tools (e.g. covariance functions and methods for automatic relevance determination). Third, we show that the posterior distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution which enables development of an efficient variational free-energy scheme for performing approximate inference and approximate maximum-likelihood learning."}
{"text": "Datasets are growing not just in size but in complexity, creating a demand for rich models and quantification of uncertainty. Bayesian methods are an excellent fit for this demand, but scaling Bayesian inference is a challenge. In response to this challenge, there has been considerable recent work based on varying assumptions about model structure, underlying computational resources, and the importance of asymptotic correctness. As a result, there is a zoo of ideas with few clear overarching principles.   In this paper, we seek to identify unifying principles, patterns, and intuitions for scaling Bayesian inference. We review existing work on utilizing modern computing resources with both MCMC and variational approximation techniques. From this taxonomy of ideas, we characterize the general principles that have proven successful for designing scalable inference procedures and comment on the path forward."}
{"text": "To the best of our knowledge, there are no general well-founded robust methods for statistical unsupervised learning. Most of the unsupervised methods explicitly or implicitly depend on the kernel covariance operator (kernel CO) or kernel cross-covariance operator (kernel CCO). They are sensitive to contaminated data, even when using bounded positive definite kernels. First, we propose robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and robust kernel crosscovariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we propose influence function of classical kernel canonical correlation analysis (classical kernel CCA). Third, using this influence function, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method based on robust kernel CO and robust kernel CCO, called robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel methods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO. Experiments on synthesized and imaging genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed visualization and robust kernel CCA can be applied effectively to both ideal data and contaminated data. The robust methods show the superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Sampling with replacement occurs in many settings in machine learning, notably in the bagging ensemble technique and the .632+ validation scheme. The number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample can have an important role in the behaviour of prediction models learned on it. Indeed, there are uncontrived examples where duplicate items have no effect. The purpose of this report is to present the distribution of the number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample clearly and concisely, with a view to enabling other machine learning researchers to understand and control this quantity in existing and future resampling techniques. We describe the key characteristics of this distribution along with the generalisation for the case where items come from distinct categories, as in classification. In both cases we discuss the normal limit, and conduct an empirical investigation to derive a heuristic for when a normal approximation is permissible."}
{"text": "Dynamic topic models (DTMs) are very effective in discovering topics and capturing their evolution trends in time series data. To do posterior inference of DTMs, existing methods are all batch algorithms that scan the full dataset before each update of the model and make inexact variational approximations with mean-field assumptions. Due to a lack of a more scalable inference algorithm, despite the usefulness, DTMs have not captured large topic dynamics.   This paper fills this research void, and presents a fast and parallelizable inference algorithm using Gibbs Sampling with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics that does not make any unwarranted assumptions. We also present a Metropolis-Hastings based $O(1)$ sampler for topic assignments for each word token. In a distributed environment, our algorithm requires very little communication between workers during sampling (almost embarrassingly parallel) and scales up to large-scale applications. We are able to learn the largest Dynamic Topic Model to our knowledge, and learned the dynamics of 1,000 topics from 2.6 million documents in less than half an hour, and our empirical results show that our algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than the baselines but also achieves lower perplexity."}
{"text": "Many machine learning problems can be characterized by mutual contamination models. In these problems, one observes several random samples from different convex combinations of a set of unknown base distributions. It is of interest to decontaminate mutual contamination models, i.e., to recover the base distributions either exactly or up to a permutation. This paper considers the general setting where the base distributions are defined on arbitrary probability spaces. We examine the decontamination problem in two mutual contamination models that describe popular machine learning tasks: recovering the base distributions up to a permutation in a mixed membership model, and recovering the base distributions exactly in a partial label model for classification. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability of both mutual contamination models, algorithms for both problems in the infinite and finite sample cases, and introduce novel proof techniques based on affine geometry."}
{"text": "We propose the segmented iHMM (siHMM), a hierarchical infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that supports a simple, efficient inference scheme. The siHMM is well suited to segmentation problems, where the goal is to identify points at which a time series transitions from one relatively stable regime to a new regime. Conventional iHMMs often struggle with such problems, since they have no mechanism for distinguishing between high- and low-level dynamics. Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs) can do better, but they require much more complex and expensive inference algorithms. The siHMM retains the simplicity and efficiency of the iHMM, but outperforms it on a variety of segmentation problems, achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of a more complicated HHMM."}
{"text": "We introduce a new approach for amortizing inference in directed graphical models by learning heuristic approximations to stochastic inverses, designed specifically for use as proposal distributions in sequential Monte Carlo methods. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning a structured neural network which represents an inverse factorization of the graphical model, resulting in a conditional density estimator that takes as input particular values of the observed random variables, and returns an approximation to the distribution of the latent variables. This recognition model can be learned offline, independent from any particular dataset, prior to performing inference. The output of these networks can be used as automatically-learned high-quality proposal distributions to accelerate sequential Monte Carlo across a diverse range of problem settings."}
{"text": "Consider the problem of sparse clustering, where it is assumed that only a subset of the features are useful for clustering purposes. In the framework of the COSA method of Friedman and Meulman, subsequently improved in the form of the Sparse K-means method of Witten and Tibshirani, a natural and simpler hill-climbing approach is introduced. The new method is shown to be competitive with these two methods and others."}
{"text": "In this paper, we present a framework for fitting multivariate Hawkes processes for large-scale problems both in the number of events in the observed history $n$ and the number of event types $d$ (i.e. dimensions). The proposed Low-Rank Hawkes Process (LRHP) framework introduces a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix that allows to perform the nonparametric learning of the $d^2$ triggering kernels using at most $O(ndr^2)$ operations, where $r$ is the rank of the approximation ($r \\ll d,n$). This comes as a major improvement to the existing state-of-the-art inference algorithms that are in $O(nd^2)$. Furthermore, the low-rank approximation allows LRHP to learn representative patterns of interaction between event types, which may be valuable for the analysis of such complex processes in real world datasets. The efficiency and scalability of our approach is illustrated with numerical experiments on simulated as well as real datasets."}
{"text": "We consider Bayesian optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box objective function, where we also have access to cheaper approximations of the objective. In general, such approximations arise in applications such as reinforcement learning, engineering, and the natural sciences, and are subject to an inherent, unknown bias. This model discrepancy is caused by an inadequate internal model that deviates from reality and can vary over the domain, making the utilization of these approximations a non-trivial task.   We present a novel algorithm that provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of the uncertainties arising from model discrepancies and noisy observations. Its optimization decisions rely on a value of information analysis that extends the Knowledge Gradient factor to the setting of multiple information sources that vary in cost: each sampling decision maximizes the predicted benefit per unit cost.   We conduct an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that the method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques: it finds designs of considerably higher objective value and additionally inflicts less cost in the exploration process."}
{"text": "We apply a wild bootstrap method to the Lancaster three-variable interaction measure in order to detect factorisation of the joint distribution on three variables forming a stationary random process, for which the existing permutation bootstrap method fails. As in the i.i.d. case, the Lancaster test is found to outperform existing tests in cases for which two independent variables individually have a weak influence on a third, but that when considered jointly the influence is strong. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: first, we prove that the Lancaster statistic satisfies the conditions required to estimate the quantiles of the null distribution using the wild bootstrap; second, the manner in which this is proved is novel, simpler than existing methods, and can further be applied to other statistics."}
{"text": "Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian \"signals\" from high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded as a generalization of projection pursuit (PP) and independent component analysis (ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed, seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA approach called least-squares NGCA (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a solution analytically through least-squares estimation of log-density gradients and eigendecomposition. However, since pre-whitening of data is involved in LSNGCA, it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a whitening-free LSNGCA method and experimentally demonstrate its superiority."}
{"text": "We introduce overdispersed black-box variational inference, a method to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator of the gradient in black-box variational inference. Instead of taking samples from the variational distribution, we use importance sampling to take samples from an overdispersed distribution in the same exponential family as the variational approximation. Our approach is general since it can be readily applied to any exponential family distribution, which is the typical choice for the variational approximation. We run experiments on two non-conjugate probabilistic models to show that our method effectively reduces the variance, and the overhead introduced by the computation of the proposal parameters and the importance weights is negligible. We find that our overdispersed importance sampling scheme provides lower variance than black-box variational inference, even when the latter uses twice the number of samples. This results in faster convergence of the black-box inference procedure."}
{"text": "Partition functions of probability distributions are important quantities for model evaluation and comparisons. We present a new method to compute partition functions of complex and multimodal distributions. Such distributions are often sampled using simulated tempering, which augments the target space with an auxiliary inverse temperature variable. Our method exploits the multinomial probability law of the inverse temperatures, and provides estimates of the partition function in terms of a simple quotient of Rao-Blackwellized marginal inverse temperature probability estimates, which are updated while sampling. We show that the method has interesting connections with several alternative popular methods, and offers some significant advantages. In particular, we empirically find that the new method provides more accurate estimates than Annealed Importance Sampling when calculating partition functions of large Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM); moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to track training and validation log-likelihoods during learning of RBMs, at minimal computational cost."}
{"text": "Kernel methods are one of the mainstays of machine learning, but the problem of kernel learning remains challenging, with only a few heuristics and very little theory. This is of particular importance in methods based on estimation of kernel mean embeddings of probability measures. For characteristic kernels, which include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely determines its probability measure, so it can be used to design a powerful statistical testing framework, which includes nonparametric two-sample and independence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaussian process prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely related to recently proposed shrinkage estimators for kernel mean embeddings, while the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various possible applications. Critically for the purposes of kernel learning, our model gives a simple, closed form marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data given the kernel hyperparameters. This marginal pseudolikelihood can either be optimized to inform the hyperparameter choice or fully Bayesian inference can be used."}
{"text": "This note compares two recently published machine learning methods for constructing flexible, but tractable families of variational hidden-variable posteriors. The first method, called \"hierarchical variational models\" enriches the inference model with an extra variable, while the other, called \"auxiliary deep generative models\", enriches the generative model instead. We conclude that the two methods are mathematically equivalent."}
{"text": "Generalised Degrees of Freedom (GDF), as defined by Ye (1998 JASA 93:120-131), represent the sensitivity of model fits to perturbations of the data. As such they can be computed for any statistical model, making it possible, in principle, to derive the number of parameters in machine-learning approaches. Defined originally for normally distributed data only, we here investigate the potential of this approach for Bernoulli-data. GDF-values for models of simulated and real data are compared to model complexity-estimates from cross-validation. Similarly, we computed GDF-based AICc for randomForest, neural networks and boosted regression trees and demonstrated its similarity to cross-validation. GDF-estimates for binary data were unstable and inconsistently sensitive to the number of data points perturbed simultaneously, while at the same time being extremely computer-intensive in their calculation. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation was more robust, based on fewer assumptions and faster to compute. Our findings suggest that the GDF-approach does not readily transfer to Bernoulli data and a wider range of regression approaches."}
{"text": "We develop Square Root Graphical Models (SQR), a novel class of parametric graphical models that provides multivariate generalizations of univariate exponential family distributions. Previous multivariate graphical models [Yang et al. 2015] did not allow positive dependencies for the exponential and Poisson generalizations. However, in many real-world datasets, variables clearly have positive dependencies. For example, the airport delay time in New York---modeled as an exponential distribution---is positively related to the delay time in Boston. With this motivation, we give an example of our model class derived from the univariate exponential distribution that allows for almost arbitrary positive and negative dependencies with only a mild condition on the parameter matrix---a condition akin to the positive definiteness of the Gaussian covariance matrix. Our Poisson generalization allows for both positive and negative dependencies without any constraints on the parameter values. We also develop parameter estimation methods using node-wise regressions with $\\ell_1$ regularization and likelihood approximation methods using sampling. Finally, we demonstrate our exponential generalization on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset of airport delay times."}
{"text": "This paper investigates the phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a signal from the magnitudes of its linear measurements. We develop statistically and computationally efficient algorithms for the situation when the measurements are corrupted by sparse outliers that can take arbitrary values. We propose a novel approach to robustify the gradient descent algorithm by using the sample median as a guide for pruning spurious samples in initialization and local search. Adopting the Poisson loss and the reshaped quadratic loss respectively, we obtain two algorithms termed median-TWF and median-RWF, both of which provably recover the signal from a near-optimal number of measurements when the measurement vectors are composed of i.i.d. Gaussian entries, up to a logarithmic factor, even when a constant fraction of the measurements are adversarially corrupted. We further show that both algorithms are stable in the presence of additional dense bounded noise. Our analysis is accomplished by developing non-trivial concentration results of median-related quantities, which may be of independent interest. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "Manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but can be computationally expensive procedures when applied to large data sets or when similarities are expensive to compute. To date, little work has been done to investigate the tradeoff between computational resources and the quality of learned representations. We present both theoretical and experimental explorations of this question. In particular, we consider Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings based on a kernel matrix, and explore how the embeddings behave when this kernel matrix is corrupted by occlusion and noise. Our main theoretical result shows that under modest noise and occlusion assumptions, we can (with high probability) recover a good approximation to the Laplacian eigenmaps embedding based on the uncorrupted kernel matrix. Our results also show how regularization can aid this approximation. Experimentally, we explore the effects of noise and occlusion on Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings of two real-world data sets, one from speech processing and one from neuroscience, as well as a synthetic data set."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of maximizing an unknown function over a compact and convex set using as few observations as possible. We observe that the optimization of the function essentially relies on learning the induced bipartite ranking rule of f. Based on this idea, we relate global optimization to bipartite ranking which allows to address problems with high dimensional input space, as well as cases of functions with weak regularity properties. The paper introduces novel meta-algorithms for global optimization which rely on the choice of any bipartite ranking method. Theoretical properties are provided as well as convergence guarantees and equivalences between various optimization methods are obtained as a by-product. Eventually, numerical evidence is given to show that the main algorithm of the paper which adapts empirically to the underlying ranking structure essentially outperforms existing state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms in typical benchmarks."}
{"text": "Linear autoregressive models serve as basic representations of discrete time stochastic processes. Different attempts have been made to provide non-linear versions of the basic autoregressive process, including different versions based on kernel methods. Motivated by the powerful framework of Hilbert space embeddings of distributions, in this paper we apply this methodology for the kernel embedding of an autoregressive process of order $p$. By doing so, we provide a non-linear version of an autoregressive process, that shows increased performance over the linear model in highly complex time series. We use the method proposed for one-step ahead forecasting of different time-series, and compare its performance against other non-linear methods."}
{"text": "The Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm has achieved notable success in training energy-based models including Restricted Boltzmann Machines and played a key role in the emergence of deep learning. The idea of this algorithm is to approximate the intractable term in the exact gradient of the log-likelihood function by using short Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs. The approximate gradient is computationally-cheap but biased. Whether and why the CD algorithm provides an asymptotically consistent estimate are still open questions. This paper studies the asymptotic properties of the CD algorithm in canonical exponential families, which are special cases of the energy-based model. Suppose the CD algorithm runs $m$ MCMC transition steps at each iteration $t$ and iteratively generates a sequence of parameter estimates $\\{\\theta_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ given an i.i.d. data sample $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\sim p_{\\theta_\\star}$. Under conditions which are commonly obeyed by the CD algorithm in practice, we prove the existence of some bounded $m$ such that any limit point of the time average $\\left. \\sum_{s=0}^{t-1} \\theta_s \\right/ t$ as $t \\to \\infty$ is a consistent estimate for the true parameter $\\theta_\\star$. Our proof is based on the fact that $\\{\\theta_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a homogenous Markov chain conditional on the data sample $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n$. This chain meets the Foster-Lyapunov drift criterion and converges to a random walk around the Maximum Likelihood Estimate. The range of the random walk shrinks to zero at rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt[3]{n})$ as the sample size $n \\to \\infty$."}
{"text": "Many real world graphs, such as the graphs of molecules, exhibit structure at multiple different scales, but most existing kernels between graphs are either purely local or purely global in character. In contrast, by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel), which has the property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two graphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels to subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible, we also introduce a randomized projection procedure, similar to the Nystr\\\"om method, but for RKHS operators."}
{"text": "We propose a general modeling and inference framework that composes probabilistic graphical models with deep learning methods and combines their respective strengths. Our model family augments graphical structure in latent variables with neural network observation models. For inference, we extend variational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributions with recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components of these models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving a scalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, natural gradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick. We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application to mouse behavioral phenotyping."}
{"text": "If a document is about travel, we may expect that short snippets of the document should also be about travel. We introduce a general framework for incorporating these types of invariances into a discriminative classifier. The framework imagines data as being drawn from a slice of a Levy process. If we slice the Levy process at an earlier point in time, we obtain additional pseudo-examples, which can be used to train the classifier. We show that this scheme has two desirable properties: it preserves the Bayes decision boundary, and it is equivalent to fitting a generative model in the limit where we rewind time back to 0. Our construction captures popular schemes such as Gaussian feature noising and dropout training, as well as admitting new generalizations."}
{"text": "We propose a new class of metrics on sets, vectors, and functions that can be used in various stages of data mining, including exploratory data analysis, learning, and result interpretation. These new distance functions unify and generalize some of the popular metrics, such as the Jaccard and bag distances on sets, Manhattan distance on vector spaces, and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance on integrable functions. We prove that the new metrics are complete and show useful relationships with $f$-divergences for probability distributions. To further extend our approach to structured objects such as concept hierarchies and ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution. We conduct empirical investigation to demonstrate intuitive interpretation of the new metrics and their effectiveness on real-valued, high-dimensional, and structured data. Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the new metrics outperformed multiple similarity and dissimilarity functions traditionally used in data mining, including the Minkowski family, the fractional $L^p$ family, two $f$-divergences, cosine distance, and two correlation coefficients. Finally, we argue that the new class of metrics is particularly appropriate for rapid processing of high-dimensional and structured data in distance-based learning."}

An ability to forecast a patent litigation and time to litigation allows companies to better allocate budget and time in managing their patent portfolios. We develop predictive models for estimating the likelihood of litigation for patents and the expected time to litigation based on both textual and non-textual features. Our work focuses on improving the state-of-the-art by relying on a different set of features and employing more sophisticated algorithms with more realistic data. The rate of patent litigations is very low, which consequently makes the problem difficult. The initial model for predicting the likelihood is further modified to capture a time-to-litigation perspective."}
{"text": "How does one objectively measure the performance of an individual offensive lineman in the NFL? The existing literature proposes various measures that rely on subjective assessments of game film, but has yet to develop an objective methodology to evaluate performance. Using a variety of statistics related to an offensive lineman's performance, we develop a framework to objectively analyze the overall performance of an individual offensive lineman and determine specific linemen who are overvalued or undervalued relative to their salary. We identify eight players across the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 NFL seasons that are considered to be overvalued or undervalued and corroborate the results with existing metrics that are based on subjective evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, the techniques set forth in this work have not been utilized in previous works to evaluate the performance of NFL players at any position, including offensive linemen."}

The problem is to identify patterns and trends in energy usage profiles of commercial and industrial customers over 24-hour periods, and group similar profiles. We tested our method on energy usage data provided by several U.S. power utilities. The results show accurate grouping of accounts similar in their energy usage patterns, and potential for the method to be utilized in energy efficiency programs."}
{"text": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are among the most played digital games in the world. In these games, teams of players fight against each other in arena environments, and the gameplay is focused on tactical combat. Mastering MOBAs requires extensive practice, as is exemplified in the popular MOBA Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2). In this paper, we present three data-driven measures of spatio-temporal behavior in DotA 2: 1) Zone changes; 2) Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via a fuzzy approach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. We investigate how behavior varies across these measures as a function of the skill level of teams, using four tiers from novice to professional players. Results indicate that spatio-temporal behavior of MOBA teams is related to team skill, with professional teams having smaller within-team distances and conducting more zone changes than amateur teams. The temporal distribution of the within-team distances of professional and high-skilled teams also generally follows patterns distinct from lower skill ranks."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of change-point detection in multivariate time-series. The multivariate distribution of the observations is supposed to follow a graphical model, whose graph and parameters are affected by abrupt changes throughout time. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform exact Bayesian inference whenever one considers a simple class of undirected graphs called spanning trees as possible structures. We are then able to integrate on the graph and segmentation spaces at the same time by combining classical dynamic programming with algebraic results pertaining to spanning trees. In particular, we show that quantities such as posterior distributions for change-points or posterior edge probabilities over time can efficiently be obtained. We illustrate our results on both synthetic and experimental data arising from biology and neuroscience."}
{"text": "In this paper, we present a unified analysis of matrix completion under general low-dimensional structural constraints induced by {\\em any} norm regularization. We consider two estimators for the general problem of structured matrix completion, and provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and the estimation error. Our analysis relies on results from generic chaining, and we establish two intermediate results of independent interest: (a) in characterizing the size or complexity of low dimensional subsets in high dimensional ambient space, a certain partial complexity measure encountered in the analysis of matrix completion problems is characterized in terms of a well understood complexity measure of Gaussian widths, and (b) it is shown that a form of restricted strong convexity holds for matrix completion problems under general norm regularization. Further, we provide several non-trivial examples of structures included in our framework, notably the recently proposed spectral $k$-support norm."}
{"text": "Quantitatively assessing relationships between latent variables and observed variables is important for understanding and developing generative models and representation learning. In this paper, we propose latent-observed dissimilarity (LOD) to evaluate the dissimilarity between the probabilistic characteristics of latent and observed variables. We also define four essential types of generative models with different independence/conditional independence configurations. Experiments using tractable real-world data show that LOD can effectively capture the differences between models and reflect the capability for higher layer learning. They also show that the conditional independence of latent variables given observed variables contributes to improving the transmission of information and characteristics from lower layers to higher layers."}
{"text": "Extremes play a special role in Anomaly Detection. Beyond inference and simulation purposes, probabilistic tools borrowed from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), such as the angular measure, can also be used to design novel statistical learning methods for Anomaly Detection/ranking. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on multivariate EVT to learn how to rank observations in a high dimensional space with respect to their degree of 'abnormality'. The procedure relies on an original dimension-reduction technique in the extreme domain that possibly produces a sparse representation of multivariate extremes and allows to gain insight into the dependence structure thereof, escaping the curse of dimensionality. The representation output by the unsupervised methodology we propose here can be combined with any Anomaly Detection technique tailored to non-extreme data. As it performs linearly with the dimension and almost linearly in the data (in O(dn log n)), it fits to large scale problems. The approach in this paper is novel in that EVT has never been used in its multivariate version in the field of Anomaly Detection. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach."}
{"text": "Many retailers today employ inventory management systems based on Re-Order Point Policies, most of which rely on the assumption that all decreases in product inventory levels result from product sales. Unfortunately, it usually happens that small but random quantities of the product get lost, stolen or broken without record as time passes, e.g., as a consequence of shoplifting. This is usual for retailers handling large varieties of inexpensive products, e.g., grocery stores. In turn, over time these discrepancies lead to stock freezing problems, i.e., situations where the system believes the stock is above the re-order point but the actual stock is at zero, and so no replenishments or sales occur. Motivated by these issues, we model the interaction between sales, losses, replenishments and inventory levels as a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where the inventory levels are unobserved (i.e., hidden) variables we wish to estimate. We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the sale and loss distributions, which relies on solving a one-dimensional dynamic program for the E-step and on solving two separate one-dimensional nonlinear programs for the M-step."}
{"text": "Nonparametric detection of existence of an anomalous structure over a network is investigated. Nodes corresponding to the anomalous structure (if one exists) receive samples generated by a distribution q, which is different from a distribution p generating samples for other nodes. If an anomalous structure does not exist, all nodes receive samples generated by p. It is assumed that the distributions p and q are arbitrary and unknown. The goal is to design statistically consistent tests with probability of errors converging to zero as the network size becomes asymptotically large. Kernel-based tests are proposed based on maximum mean discrepancy that measures the distance between mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Detection of an anomalous interval over a line network is first studied. Sufficient conditions on minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals are characterized in order to guarantee the proposed test to be consistent. It is also shown that certain necessary conditions must hold to guarantee any test to be universally consistent. Comparison of sufficient and necessary conditions yields that the proposed test is order-level optimal and nearly optimal respectively in terms of minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals. Generalization of the results to other networks is further developed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed tests."}
{"text": "Research on manifold learning within a density ridge estimation framework has shown great potential in recent work for both estimation and de-noising of manifolds, building on the intuitive and well-defined notion of principal curves and surfaces. However, the problem of unwrapping or unfolding manifolds has received relatively little attention within the density ridge approach, despite being an integral part of manifold learning in general. This paper proposes two novel algorithms for unwrapping manifolds based on estimated principal curves and surfaces for one- and multi-dimensional manifolds respectively. The methods of unwrapping are founded in the realization that both principal curves and principal surfaces will have inherent local maxima of the probability density function. Following this observation, coordinate systems that follow the shape of the manifold can be computed by following the integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate on the manifold. Furthermore, since integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate is inherently local, we propose to stitch together local coordinate systems using parallel transport along the manifold. We provide numerical experiments on both real and synthetic data that illustrates clear and intuitive unwrapping results comparable to state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms."}
{"text": "Population migration is valuable information which leads to proper decision in urban-planning strategy, massive investment, and many other fields. For instance, inter-city migration is a posterior evidence to see if the government's constrain of population works, and inter-community immigration might be a prior evidence of real estate price hike. With timely data, it is also impossible to compare which city is more favorable for the people, suppose the cities release different new regulations, we could also compare the customers of different real estate development groups, where they come from, where they probably will go. Unfortunately these data was not available.   In this paper, leveraging the data generated by positioning team in Didi, we propose a novel approach that timely monitoring population migration from community scale to provincial scale. Migration can be detected as soon as in a week. It could be faster, the setting of a week is for statistical purpose. A monitoring system is developed, then applied nation wide in China, some observations derived from the system will be presented in this paper.   This new method of migration perception is origin from the insight that nowadays people mostly moving with their personal Access Point (AP), also known as WiFi hotspot. Assume that the ratio of AP moving to the migration of population is constant, analysis of comparative population migration would be feasible. More exact quantitative research would also be done with few sample research and model regression.   The procedures of processing data includes many steps: eliminating the impact of pseudo-migration AP, for instance pocket WiFi, and second-hand traded router; distinguishing moving of population with moving of companies; identifying shifting of AP by the finger print clusters, etc.."}
{"text": "The estimation of normalizing constants is a fundamental step in probabilistic model comparison. Sequential Monte Carlo methods may be used for this task and have the advantage of being inherently parallelizable. However, the standard choice of using a fixed number of particles at each iteration is suboptimal because some steps will contribute disproportionately to the variance of the estimate. We introduce an adaptive version of the Resample-Move algorithm, in which the particle set is adaptively expanded whenever a better approximation of an intermediate distribution is needed. The algorithm builds on the expression for the optimal number of particles and the corresponding minimum variance found under ideal conditions. Benchmark results on challenging Gaussian Process Classification and Restricted Boltzmann Machine applications show that Adaptive Resample-Move (ARM) estimates the normalizing constant with a smaller variance, using less computational resources, than either Resample-Move with a fixed number of particles or Annealed Importance Sampling. A further advantage over Annealed Importance Sampling is that ARM is easier to tune."}
{"text": "We study the sparse non-negative least squares (S-NNLS) problem. S-NNLS occurs naturally in a wide variety of applications where an unknown, non-negative quantity must be recovered from linear measurements. We present a unified framework for S-NNLS based on a rectified power exponential scale mixture prior on the sparse codes. We show that the proposed framework encompasses a large class of S-NNLS algorithms and provide a computationally efficient inference procedure based on multiplicative update rules. Such update rules are convenient for solving large sets of S-NNLS problems simultaneously, which is required in contexts like sparse non-negative matrix factorization (S-NMF). We provide theoretical justification for the proposed approach by showing that the local minima of the objective function being optimized are sparse and the S-NNLS algorithms presented are guaranteed to converge to a set of stationary points of the objective function. We then extend our framework to S-NMF, showing that our framework leads to many well known S-NMF algorithms under specific choices of prior and providing a guarantee that a popular subclass of the proposed algorithms converges to a set of stationary points of the objective function. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed approaches on synthetic and real-world data."}
{"text": "While the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian ($\\mathcal{MGIG}$) distribution arises naturally in some settings as a distribution over symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, certain key properties of the distribution and effective ways of sampling from the distribution have not been carefully studied. In this paper, we show that the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ is unimodal, and the mode can be obtained by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) equation [7]. Based on the property, we propose an importance sampling method for the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ where the mode of the proposal distribution matches that of the target. The proposed sampling method is more efficient than existing approaches [32, 33], which use proposal distributions that may have the mode far from the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$'s mode. Further, we illustrate that the the posterior distribution in latent factor models, such as probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [25], when marginalized over one latent factor has the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ distribution. The characterization leads to a novel Collapsed Monte Carlo (CMC) inference algorithm for such latent factor models. We illustrate that CMC has a lower log loss or perplexity than MCMC, and needs fewer samples."}
{"text": "In recent years, structured matrix recovery problems have gained considerable attention for its real world applications, such as recommender systems and computer vision. Much of the existing work has focused on matrices with low-rank structure, and limited progress has been made matrices with other types of structure. In this paper we present non-asymptotic analysis for estimation of generally structured matrices via the generalized Dantzig selector under generic sub-Gaussian measurements. We show that the estimation error can always be succinctly expressed in terms of a few geometric measures of suitable sets which only depend on the structure of the underlying true matrix. In addition, we derive the general bounds on these geometric measures for structures characterized by unitarily invariant norms, which is a large family covering most matrix norms of practical interest. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of our theoretical development."}
{"text": "We consider a statistical inverse learning problem, where we observe the image of a function $f$ through a linear operator $A$ at i.i.d. random design points $X_i$, superposed with an additive noise. The distribution of the design points is unknown and can be very general. We analyze simultaneously the direct (estimation of $Af$) and the inverse (estimation of $f$) learning problems. In this general framework, we obtain strong and weak minimax optimal rates of convergence (as the number of observations $n$ grows large) for a large class of spectral regularization methods over regularity classes defined through appropriate source conditions. This improves on or completes previous results obtained in related settings. The optimality of the obtained rates is shown not only in the exponent in $n$ but also in the explicit dependency of the constant factor in the variance of the noise and the radius of the source condition set."}
{"text": "Due to challenging applications such as collaborative filtering, the matrix completion problem has been widely studied in the past few years. Different approaches rely on different structure assumptions on the matrix in hand. Here, we focus on the completion of a (possibly) low-rank matrix with binary entries, the so-called 1-bit matrix completion problem. Our approach relies on tools from machine learning theory: empirical risk minimization and its convex relaxations. We propose an algorithm to compute a variational approximation of the pseudo-posterior. Thanks to the convex relaxation, the corresponding minimization problem is bi-convex, and thus the method behaves well in practice. We also study the performance of this variational approximation through PAC-Bayesian learning bounds. On the contrary to previous works that focused on upper bounds on the estimation error of M with various matrix norms, we are able to derive from this analysis a PAC bound on the prediction error of our algorithm.   We focus essentially on convex relaxation through the hinge loss, for which we present the complete analysis, a complete simulation study and a test on the MovieLens data set. However, we also discuss a variational approximation to deal with the logistic loss."}
{"text": "In this article, we present the elitist particle filter based on evolutionary strategies (EPFES) as an efficient approach for nonlinear system identification. The EPFES is derived from the frequently-employed state-space model, where the relevant information of the nonlinear system is captured by an unknown state vector. Similar to classical particle filtering, the EPFES consists of a set of particles and respective weights which represent different realizations of the latent state vector and their likelihood of being the solution of the optimization problem. As main innovation, the EPFES includes an evolutionary elitist-particle selection which combines long-term information with instantaneous sampling from an approximated continuous posterior distribution. In this article, we propose two advancements of the previously-published elitist-particle selection process. Further, the EPFES is shown to be a generalization of the widely-used Gaussian particle filter and thus evaluated with respect to the latter for two completely different scenarios: First, we consider the so-called univariate nonstationary growth model with time-variant latent state variable, where the evolutionary selection of elitist particles is evaluated for non-recursively calculated particle weights. Second, the problem of nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation is addressed in a simulated scenario with speech as input signal: By using long-term fitness measures, we highlight the efficacy of the well-generalizing EPFES in estimating the nonlinear system even for large search spaces. Finally, we illustrate similarities between the EPFES and evolutionary algorithms to outline future improvements by fusing the achievements of both fields of research."}
{"text": "Time-varying mixture densities occur in many scenarios, for example, the distributions of keywords that appear in publications may evolve from year to year, video frame features associated with multiple targets may evolve in a sequence. Any models that realistically cater to this phenomenon must exhibit two important properties: the underlying mixture densities must have an unknown number of mixtures, and there must be some \"smoothness\" constraints in place for the adjacent mixture densities. The traditional Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) may be suited to the first property, but certainly not the second. This is due to how each random measure in the lower hierarchies is sampled independent of each other and hence does not facilitate any temporal correlations. To overcome such shortcomings, we proposed a new Smoothed Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (sHDP). The key novelty of this model is that we place a temporal constraint amongst the nearby discrete measures $\\{G_j\\}$ in the form of symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence with a fixed bound $B$. Although the constraint we place only involves a single scalar value, it nonetheless allows for flexibility in the corresponding successive measures. Remarkably, it also led us to infer the model within the stick-breaking process where the traditional Beta distribution used in stick-breaking is now replaced by a new constraint calculated from $B$. We present the inference algorithm and elaborate on its solutions. Our experiment using NIPS keywords has shown the desirable effect of the model."}
{"text": "We introduce sparse random projection, an important dimension-reduction tool from machine learning, for the estimation of discrete-choice models with high-dimensional choice sets. Initially, high-dimensional data are compressed into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using random projections. Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclic monotonicity moment inequalities implied by the multinomial choice model; the estimation procedure is semi-parametric and does not require explicit distributional assumptions to be made regarding the random utility errors. The random projection procedure is justified via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma -- the pairwise distances between data points are preserved during data compression, which we exploit to show convergence of our estimator. The estimator works well in simulations and in an application to a supermarket scanner dataset."}
{"text": "We consider a firm that sells products over $T$ periods without knowing the demand function. The firm sequentially sets prices to earn revenue and to learn the underlying demand function simultaneously. A natural heuristic for this problem, commonly used in practice, is greedy iterative least squares (GILS). At each time period, GILS estimates the demand as a linear function of the price by applying least squares to the set of prior prices and realized demands. Then a price that maximizes the revenue, given the estimated demand function, is used for the next time period. The performance is measured by the regret, which is the expected revenue loss from the optimal (oracle) pricing policy when the demand function is known. Recently, den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014) demonstrated that GILS is sub-optimal. They introduced algorithms which integrate forced price dispersion with GILS and achieve asymptotically optimal performance.   In this paper, we consider this dynamic pricing problem in a data-rich environment. In particular, we assume that the firm knows the expected demand under a particular price from historical data, and in each period, before setting the price, the firm has access to extra information (demand covariates) which may be predictive of the demand. We prove that in this setting GILS achieves asymptotically optimal regret of order $\\log(T)$. We also show the following surprising result: in the original dynamic pricing problem of den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014), inclusion of any set of covariates in GILS as potential demand covariates (even though they could carry no information) would make GILS asymptotically optimal. We validate our results via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "We present a methodology for clustering N objects which are described by multivariate time series, i.e. several sequences of real-valued random variables. This clustering methodology leverages copulas which are distributions encoding the dependence structure between several random variables. To take fully into account the dependence information while clustering, we need a distance between copulas. In this work, we compare renowned distances between distributions: the Fisher-Rao geodesic distance, related divergences and optimal transport, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Applications of such methodology can be found in the clustering of financial assets. A tutorial, experiments and implementation for reproducible research can be found at www.datagrapple.com/Tech."}
{"text": "Sparse generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) plays a pivotal role in a large family of high-dimensional statistical models, including sparse Fisher's discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and sufficient dimension reduction. Sparse GEP involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. Most existing methods and theory in the context of specific statistical models that are special cases of the sparse GEP require restrictive structural assumptions on the input matrices. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational framework to solve the sparse GEP. At the first stage, we solve a convex relaxation of the sparse GEP. Taking the solution as an initial value, we then exploit a nonconvex optimization perspective and propose the truncated Rayleigh flow method (Rifle) to estimate the leading generalized eigenvector. We show that Rifle converges linearly to a solution with the optimal statistical rate of convergence for many statistical models. Theoretically, our method significantly improves upon the existing literature by eliminating structural assumptions on the input matrices for both stages. To achieve this, our analysis involves two key ingredients: (i) a new analysis of the gradient based method on nonconvex objective functions, and (ii) a fine-grained characterization of the evolution of sparsity patterns along the solution path. Thorough numerical studies are provided to validate the theoretical results."}
{"text": "The modern data analyst must cope with data encoded in various forms, vectors, matrices, strings, graphs, or more. Consequently, statistical and machine learning models tailored to different data encodings are important. We focus on data encoded as normalized vectors, so that their \"direction\" is more important than their magnitude. Specifically, we consider high-dimensional vectors that lie either on the surface of the unit hypersphere or on the real projective plane. For such data, we briefly review common mathematical models prevalent in machine learning, while also outlining some technical aspects, software, applications, and open mathematical challenges."}
{"text": "Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are probabilistic tools of choice for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables in complex systems. Finding changepoints in the structural evolution of a GGM is therefore essential to detecting anomalies in the underlying system modeled by the GGM. In order to detect structural anomalies in a GGM, we consider the problem of estimating changes in the precision matrix of the corresponding Gaussian distribution. We take a two-step approach to solving this problem:- (i) estimating a background precision matrix using system observations from the past without any anomalies, and (ii) estimating a foreground precision matrix using a sliding temporal window during anomaly monitoring. Our primary contribution is in estimating the foreground precision using a novel contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure. In order to accurately learn only the structural changes to the GGM, we maximize a penalized log-likelihood where the penalty is the $l_1$ norm of difference between the foreground precision being estimated and the already learned background precision. We modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for sparse inverse covariance estimation to perform contrastive estimation of the foreground precision matrix. Our results on simulated GGM data show significant improvement in precision and recall for detecting structural changes to the GGM, compared to a non-contrastive sliding window baseline."}
{"text": "Separating the short jobs from the long is a known technique to improve scheduling performance. In this paper we describe a method we developed for accurately predicting the runtimes classes of the jobs to enable this separation. Our method uses the fact that the runtimes can be represented as a mixture of overlapping Gaussian distributions, in order to train a CART classifier to provide the prediction. The threshold that separates the short jobs from the long jobs is determined during the evaluation of the classifier to maximize prediction accuracy. Our results indicate overall accuracy of 90% for the data set used in our study, with sensitivity and specificity both above 90%."}
{"text": "Distributional (or distribution-valued) data are a new type of data arising from several sources and are considered as realizations of distributional variables. A new set of fuzzy c-means algorithms for data described by distributional variables is proposed.   The algorithms use the $L2$ Wasserstein distance between distributions as dissimilarity measures. Beside the extension of the fuzzy c-means algorithm for distributional data, and considering a decomposition of the squared $L2$ Wasserstein distance, we propose a set of algorithms using different automatic way to compute the weights associated with the variables as well as with their components, globally or cluster-wise. The relevance weights are computed in the clustering process introducing product-to-one constraints.   The relevance weights induce adaptive distances expressing the importance of each variable or of each component in the clustering process, acting also as a variable selection method in clustering. We have tested the proposed algorithms on artificial and real-world data. Results confirm that the proposed methods are able to better take into account the cluster structure of the data with respect to the standard fuzzy c-means, with non-adaptive distances."}
{"text": "Controlled interventions provide the most direct source of information for learning causal effects. In particular, a dose-response curve can be learned by varying the treatment level and observing the corresponding outcomes. However, interventions can be expensive and time-consuming. Observational data, where the treatment is not controlled by a known mechanism, is sometimes available. Under some strong assumptions, observational data allows for the estimation of dose-response curves. Estimating such curves nonparametrically is hard: sample sizes for controlled interventions may be small, while in the observational case a large number of measured confounders may need to be marginalized. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical Gaussian process prior that constructs a distribution over the dose-response curve by learning from observational data, and reshapes the distribution with a nonparametric affine transform learned from controlled interventions. This function composition from different sources is shown to speed-up learning, which we demonstrate with a thorough sensitivity analysis and an application to modeling the effect of therapy on cognitive skills of premature infants."}
{"text": "With the recent popularity of graphical clustering methods, there has been an increased focus on the information between samples. We show how learning cluster structure using edge features naturally and simultaneously determines the most likely number of clusters and addresses data scale issues. These results are particularly useful in instances where (a) there are a large number of clusters and (b) we have some labeled edges. Applications in this domain include image segmentation, community discovery and entity resolution. Our model is an extension of the planted partition model and our solution uses results of correlation clustering, which achieves a partition O(log(n))-close to the log-likelihood of the true clustering."}
{"text": "Biological systems are often modelled at different levels of abstraction depending on the particular aims/resources of a study. Such different models often provide qualitatively concordant predictions over specific parametrisations, but it is generally unclear whether model predictions are quantitatively in agreement, and whether such agreement holds for different parametrisations. Here we present a generally applicable statistical machine learning methodology to automatically reconcile the predictions of different models across abstraction levels. Our approach is based on defining a correction map, a random function which modifies the output of a model in order to match the statistics of the output of a different model of the same system. We use two biological examples to give a proof-of-principle demonstration of the methodology, and discuss its advantages and potential further applications."}

We prove the existence of an optimal MAPE model and we show the universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization based on the MAPE.

The behavior of the MAPE kernel regression is illustrated on simulated data."}
{"text": "Multivariate Analysis (MVA) comprises a family of well-known methods for feature extraction that exploit correlations among input variables of the data representation. One important property that is enjoyed by most such methods is uncorrelation among the extracted features. Recently, regularized versions of MVA methods have appeared in the literature, mainly with the goal to gain interpretability of the solution. In these cases, the solutions can no longer be obtained in a closed manner, and it is frequent to recur to the iteration of two steps, one of them being an orthogonal Procrustes problem. This letter shows that the Procrustes solution is not optimal from the perspective of the overall MVA method, and proposes an alternative approach based on the solution of an eigenvalue problem. Our method ensures the preservation of several properties of the original methods, most notably the uncorrelation of the extracted features, as demonstrated theoretically and through a collection of selected experiments."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose a new method to predict the final destination of vehicle trips based on their initial partial trajectories. We first review how we obtained clustering of trajectories that describes user behaviour. Then, we explain how we model main traffic flow patterns by a mixture of 2d Gaussian distributions. This yielded a density based clustering of locations, which produces a data driven grid of similar points within each pattern. We present how this model can be used to predict the final destination of a new trajectory based on their first locations using a two step procedure: We first assign the new trajectory to the clusters it mot likely belongs. Secondly, we use characteristics from trajectories inside these clusters to predict the final destination. Finally, we present experimental results of our methods for classification of trajectories and final destination prediction on datasets of timestamped GPS-Location of taxi trips. We test our methods on two different datasets, to assess the capacity of our method to adapt automatically to different subsets."}
{"text": "A very simple interpretation of matrix completion problem is introduced based on statistical models.

{"text": "Structural equation models (SEMs) have been widely adopted for inference of causal interactions in complex networks. Recent examples include unveiling topologies of hidden causal networks over which processes such as spreading diseases, or rumors propagate. The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from their simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear dependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent to adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which account for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The advocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for nonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put forth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a convex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to proximal-splitting optimization methods. To this end, solvers with complementary merits are developed by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers, and proximal gradient iterations. Experiments conducted on simulated data demonstrate that the novel approach outperforms linear SEMs with respect to edge detection errors. Furthermore, tests on a real gene expression dataset unveil interesting new edges that were not revealed by linear SEMs, which could shed more light on regulatory behavior of human genes."}

Unlike other methods, ABtree specifically produces decision rules for optimal treatment assignment on a per-individual basis. The treatment choices are selected for maximizing the overall occurrence of a desired binary outcome, conditional on a set of covariates.

{"text": "This volume is a collection of contributions from the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Interpretation in Neuroimaging (MLINI) at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015) conference. Modern multivariate statistical methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state detection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysis methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional signals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category of a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental disorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate approaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual imaging measurement in isolation.   We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how questions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is now entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally important that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly evolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, there is an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context of rich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specific paradigms that pinpoint a single function, towards schemes for measuring the interaction with natural and more varied scene are made. The goal of the workshop is to pinpoint the most pressing issues and common challenges across the neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology and machine learning fields, and to sketch future directions and open questions in the light of novel methodology."}
{"text": "Many complex ecosystems, such as those formed by multiple microbial taxa, involve intricate interactions amongst various sub-communities. The most basic relationships are frequently modeled as co-occurrence networks in which the nodes represent the various players in the community and the weighted edges encode levels of interaction. In this setting, the composition of a community may be viewed as a probability distribution on the nodes of the network. This paper develops methods for modeling the organization of such data, as well as their Euclidean counterparts, across spatial scales. Using the notion of diffusion distance, we introduce diffusion Frechet functions and diffusion Frechet vectors associated with probability distributions on Euclidean space and the vertex set of a weighted network, respectively. We prove that these functional statistics are stable with respect to the Wasserstein distance between probability measures, thus yielding robust descriptors of their shapes. We apply the methodology to investigate bacterial communities in the human gut, seeking to characterize divergence from intestinal homeostasis in patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation, a treatment used in CDI patients that has proven to be significantly more effective than traditional treatment with antibiotics. The proposed method proves useful in deriving a biomarker that might help elucidate the mechanisms that drive these processes."}
{"text": "We present a method based on the orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix tri-factorization of the normalized Laplacian matrix for community detection in complex networks. While the exact factorization of a given order may not exist and is NP hard to compute, we obtain an approximate factorization by solving an optimization problem. We establish the connection of the factors obtained through the factorization to a non-negative basis of an invariant subspace of the estimated matrix, drawing parallel with the spectral clustering. Using such factorization for clustering in networks is motivated by analyzing a block-diagonal Laplacian matrix with the blocks representing the connected components of a graph. The method is shown to be consistent for community detection in graphs generated from the stochastic block model and the degree corrected stochastic block model. Simulation results and real data analysis show the effectiveness of these methods under a wide variety of situations, including sparse and highly heterogeneous graphs where the usual spectral clustering is known to fail. Our method also performs better than the state of the art in popular benchmark network datasets, e.g., the political web blogs and the karate club data."}
{"text": "We study the problem of estimating the parameters of a regression model from a set of observations, each consisting of a response and a predictor. The response is assumed to be related to the predictor via a regression model of unknown parameters. Often, in such models the parameters to be estimated are assumed to be constant. Here we consider the more general scenario where the parameters are allowed to evolve over time, a more natural assumption for many applications. We model these dynamics via a linear update equation with additive noise that is often used in a wide range of engineering applications, particularly in the well-known and widely used Kalman filter (where the system state it seeks to estimate maps to the parameter values here). We derive an approximate algorithm to estimate both the mean and the variance of the parameter estimates in an online fashion for a generic regression model. This algorithm turns out to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter. We specialize our algorithm to the multivariate exponential family distribution to obtain a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM). Because the common regression models encountered in practice such as logistic, exponential and multinomial all have observations modeled through an exponential family distribution, our results are used to easily obtain algorithms for online mean and variance parameter estimation for all these regression models in the context of time-dependent parameters. Lastly, we propose to use these algorithms in the contextual multi-armed bandit scenario, where so far model parameters are assumed static and observations univariate and Gaussian or Bernoulli. Both of these restrictions can be relaxed using the algorithms described here, which we combine with Thompson sampling to show the resulting performance on a simulation."}
{"text": "With the rapid growth of crowdsourcing platforms it has become easy and relatively inexpensive to collect a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short time. However due to the lack of control over the quality of the annotators, some abnormal annotators may be affected by position bias which can potentially degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper we introduce a statistical framework to model and detect annotator's position bias in order to control the false discovery rate (FDR) without a prior knowledge on the amount of biased annotators - the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries being not too high, in order to assure that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. The key technical development relies on some new knockoff filters adapted to our problem and new algorithms based on the Inverse Scale Space dynamics whose discretization is potentially suitable for large scale crowdsourcing data analysis. Our studies are supported by experiments with both simulated examples and real-world data. The proposed framework provides us a useful tool for quantitatively studying annotator's abnormal behavior in crowdsourcing data arising from machine learning, sociology, computer vision, multimedia, etc."}
{"text": "Sparse versions of principal component analysis (PCA) have imposed themselves as simple, yet powerful ways of selecting relevant features of high-dimensional data in an unsupervised manner. However, when several sparse principal components are computed, the interpretation of the selected variables is difficult since each axis has its own sparsity pattern and has to be interpreted separately. To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure called globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA) that allows to obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. This allows the practitioner to identify the original variables which are relevant to describe the data. To this end, using Roweis' probabilistic interpretation of PCA and a Gaussian prior on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact computation of the marginal likelihood of a Bayesian PCA model. To avoid the drawbacks of discrete model selection, a simple relaxation of this framework is presented. It allows to find a path of models using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood is then maximized over this path. This approach is illustrated on real and synthetic data sets. In particular, using unlabeled microarray data, GSPPCA infers much more relevant gene subsets than traditional sparse PCA algorithms."}
{"text": "We extend Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to perform posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes. This development allows us to define a Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE), a Bayesian nonparametric version of the variational autoencoder that has a latent representation with stochastic dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the SB-VAE, and a semi-supervised variant, learn highly discriminative latent representations that often outperform the Gaussian VAE's."}
{"text": "We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. Popular methods rely on estimating a penalized maximum likelihood of the precision matrix. However, in these approaches structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term, the penalty can be difficult to adapt for domain-specific knowledge, and the inference is computationally demanding. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function, parametrized by a neural network that maps empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. Applying this framework, we find our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well: identifying relevant edges in both synthetic and real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain performance generally superior to analytical methods."}
{"text": "Kernel-based quadrature rules are becoming important in machine learning and statistics, as they achieve super-$\\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates in numerical integration, and thus provide alternatives to Monte Carlo integration in challenging settings where integrands are expensive to evaluate or where integrands are high dimensional. These rules are based on the assumption that the integrand has a certain degree of smoothness, which is expressed as that the integrand belongs to a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, this assumption can be violated in practice (e.g., when the integrand is a black box function), and no general theory has been established for the convergence of kernel quadratures in such misspecified settings. Our contribution is in proving that kernel quadratures can be consistent even when the integrand does not belong to the assumed RKHS, i.e., when the integrand is less smooth than assumed. Specifically, we derive convergence rates that depend on the (unknown) lesser smoothness of the integrand, where the degree of smoothness is expressed via powers of RKHSs or via Sobolev spaces."}
{"text": "In many applications, it is desirable to extract only the relevant aspects of data. A principled way to do this is the information bottleneck (IB) method, where one seeks a code that maximizes information about a 'relevance' variable, Y, while constraining the information encoded about the original data, X. Unfortunately however, the IB method is computationally demanding when data are high-dimensional and/or non-gaussian. Here we propose an approximate variational scheme for maximizing a lower bound on the IB objective, analogous to variational EM. Using this method, we derive an IB algorithm to recover features that are both relevant and sparse. Finally, we demonstrate how kernelized versions of the algorithm can be used to address a broad range of problems with non-linear relation between X and Y."}
{"text": "We extend the traditional worst-case, minimax analysis of stochastic convex optimization by introducing a localized form of minimax complexity for individual functions. Our main result gives function-specific lower and upper bounds on the number of stochastic subgradient evaluations needed to optimize either the function or its \"hardest local alternative\" to a given numerical precision. The bounds are expressed in terms of a localized and computational analogue of the modulus of continuity that is central to statistical minimax analysis. We show how the computational modulus of continuity can be explicitly calculated in concrete cases, and relates to the curvature of the function at the optimum. We also prove a superefficiency result that demonstrates it is a meaningful benchmark, acting as a computational analogue of the Fisher information in statistical estimation. The nature and practical implications of the results are demonstrated in simulations."}
{"text": "Dictionary learning is a cutting-edge area in imaging processing, that has recently led to state-of-the-art results in many signal processing tasks. The idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a learned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis. Determining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for both precision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionary learning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novel regularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method can simultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionary size. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with the non-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples are presented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"text": "The hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a specified kernel are often estimated from the data via the maximum marginal likelihood. Due to the non-convexity of marginal likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters, the optimization may not converge to the global maxima. A common approach to tackle this issue is to use multiple starting points randomly selected from a specific prior distribution. As a result the choice of prior distribution may play a vital role in the predictability of this approach. However, there exists little research in the literature to study the impact of the prior distributions on the hyperparameter estimation and the performance of GPR. In this paper, we provide the first empirical study on this problem using simulated and real data experiments. We consider different types of priors for the initial values of hyperparameters for some commonly used kernels and investigate the influence of the priors on the predictability of GPR models. The results reveal that, once a kernel is chosen, different priors for the initial hyperparameters have no significant impact on the performance of GPR prediction, despite that the estimates of the hyperparameters are very different to the true values in some cases."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of robustifying high-dimensional structured estimation. Robust techniques are key in real-world applications which often involve outliers and data corruption. We focus on trimmed versions of structurally regularized M-estimators in the high-dimensional setting, including the popular Least Trimmed Squares estimator, as well as analogous estimators for generalized linear models and graphical models, using possibly non-convex loss functions. We present a general analysis of their statistical convergence rates and consistency, and then take a closer look at the trimmed versions of the Lasso and Graphical Lasso estimators as special cases. On the optimization side, we show how to extend algorithms for M-estimators to fit trimmed variants and provide guarantees on their numerical convergence. The generality and competitive performance of high-dimensional trimmed estimators are illustrated numerically on both simulated and real-world genomics data."}
{"text": "We propose a data-driven, coarse-graining formulation in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast to existing techniques which are based on a fine-to-coarse map, we adopt the opposite strategy by prescribing a probabilistic coarse-to-fine map. This corresponds to a directed probabilistic model where the coarse variables play the role of latent generators of the fine scale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the framework proposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy method and is capable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place during the CG process. Furthermore, it can be readily extended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are reflected in the posterior of the model parameters. The latter can be used to produce not only point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions or macroscopic observables, but more importantly, predictive posterior distributions on these quantities. Predictive posterior distributions reflect the confidence of the model as a function of the amount of data and the level of coarse-graining. The issues of model complexity and model selection are seamlessly addressed by employing a hierarchical prior that favors the discovery of sparse solutions, revealing the most prominent features in the coarse-grained model. A flexible and parallelizable Monte Carlo - Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) scheme is proposed for carrying out inference and learning tasks. A comparative assessment of the proposed methodology is presented for a lattice spin system and the SPC/E water model."}
{"text": "Generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) aims at finding latent low-dimensional common structure from multiple views (feature vectors in different domains) of the same entities. Unlike principal component analysis (PCA) that handles a single view, (G)CCA is able to integrate information from different feature spaces. Here we focus on MAX-VAR GCCA, a popular formulation which has recently gained renewed interest in multilingual processing and speech modeling. The classic MAX-VAR GCCA problem can be solved optimally via eigen-decomposition of a matrix that compounds the (whitened) correlation matrices of the views; but this solution has serious scalability issues, and is not directly amenable to incorporating pertinent structural constraints such as non-negativity and sparsity on the canonical components. We posit regularized MAX-VAR GCCA as a non-convex optimization problem and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to handle it. Our algorithm alternates between {\\em inexact} solutions of a regularized least squares subproblem and a manifold-constrained non-convex subproblem, thereby achieving substantial memory and computational savings. An important benefit of our design is that it can easily handle structure-promoting regularization. We show that the algorithm globally converges to a critical point at a sublinear rate, and approaches a global optimal solution at a linear rate when no regularization is considered. Judiciously designed simulations and large-scale word embedding tasks are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "Stochastic variational inference (SVI), the state-of-the-art algorithm for scaling variational inference to large-datasets, is inherently serial. Moreover, it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single processor; this is problematic when the number of parameters is in billions. In this paper, we propose extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), an asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference for mixture models on massive real world datasets. ESVI overcomes the limitations of SVI by requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a subset of the parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESVI by running Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on UMBC-3B, a dataset that has a vocabulary of 3 million and a token size of 3 billion. In our experiments, we found that ESVI not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time, but also achieves a better quality solution. In addition, we propose a strategy to speed up computation and save memory when fitting large number of topics."}
{"text": "Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images for diagnosis of a clinical condition. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total Variation (TV) enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties but reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed towards any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: To propose an expression of the duality gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the convergence speed. We provide a convergence rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision."}
{"text": "Imaging genetic research has essentially focused on discovering unique and co-association effects, but typically ignoring to identify outliers or atypical objects in genetic as well as non-genetics variables. Identifying significant outliers is an essential and challenging issue for imaging genetics and multiple sources data analysis. Therefore, we need to examine for transcription errors of identified outliers. First, we address the influence function (IF) of kernel mean element, kernel covariance operator, kernel cross-covariance operator, kernel canonical correlation analysis (kernel CCA) and multiple kernel CCA. Second, we propose an IF of multiple kernel CCA, which can be applied for more than two datasets. Third, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations of multiple sources of data based on the IF of kernel CCA and multiple kernel CCA. Finally, the proposed methods are capable of analyzing outliers of subjects usually found in biomedical applications, in which the number of dimension is large. To examine the outliers, we use the stem-and-leaf display. Experiments on both synthesized and imaging genetics data (e.g., SNP, fMRI, and DNA methylation) demonstrate that the proposed visualization can be applied effectively."}
{"text": "In genome-wide interaction studies, to detect gene-gene interactions, most methods are divided into two folds: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based and gene-based methods. Basically, the methods based on the gene are more effective than the methods based on a single SNP. Recent years, while the kernel canonical correlation analysis (Classical kernel CCA) based U statistic (KCCU) has proposed to detect the nonlinear relationship between genes. To estimate the variance in KCCU, they have used resampling based methods which are highly computationally intensive. In addition, classical kernel CCA is not robust to contaminated data. We, therefore, first discuss robust kernel mean element, the robust kernel covariance, and cross-covariance operators. Second, we propose a method based on influence function to estimate the variance of the KCCU. Third, we propose a nonparametric robust KCCU method based on robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. Finally, we investigate the proposed methods to synthesized data and imaging genetic data set. Based on gene ontology and pathway analysis, the synthesized and genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed robust method shows the superior performance of the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "We present a novel k-way high-dimensional graphical model called the Generalized Root Model (GRM) that explicitly models dependencies between variable sets of size k > 2---where k = 2 is the standard pairwise graphical model. This model is based on taking the k-th root of the original sufficient statistics of any univariate exponential family with positive sufficient statistics, including the Poisson and exponential distributions. As in the recent work with square root graphical (SQR) models [Inouye et al. 2016]---which was restricted to pairwise dependencies---we give the conditions of the parameters that are needed for normalization using the radial conditionals similar to the pairwise case [Inouye et al. 2016]. In particular, we show that the Poisson GRM has no restrictions on the parameters and the exponential GRM only has a restriction akin to negative definiteness. We develop a simple but general learning algorithm based on L1-regularized node-wise regressions. We also present a general way of numerically approximating the log partition function and associated derivatives of the GRM univariate node conditionals---in contrast to [Inouye et al. 2016], which only provided algorithm for estimating the exponential SQR. To illustrate GRM, we model word counts with a Poisson GRM and show the associated k-sized variable sets. We finish by discussing methods for reducing the parameter space in various situations."}
{"text": "We propose a nonconvex estimator for joint multivariate regression and precision matrix estimation in the high dimensional regime, under sparsity constraints. A gradient descent algorithm with hard thresholding is developed to solve the nonconvex estimator, and it attains a linear rate of convergence to the true regression coefficients and precision matrix simultaneously, up to the statistical error. Compared with existing methods along this line of research, which have little theoretical guarantee, the proposed algorithm not only is computationally much more efficient with provable convergence guarantee, but also attains the optimal finite sample statistical rate up to a logarithmic factor. Thorough experiments on both synthetic and real datasets back up our theory."}
{"text": "We introduce the truncated Gaussian graphical model (TGGM) as a novel framework for designing statistical models for nonlinear learning. A TGGM is a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) with a subset of variables truncated to be nonnegative. The truncated variables are assumed latent and integrated out to induce a marginal model. We show that the variables in the marginal model are non-Gaussian distributed and their expected relations are nonlinear. We use expectation-maximization to break the inference of the nonlinear model into a sequence of TGGM inference problems, each of which is efficiently solved by using the properties and numerical methods of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We use the TGGM to design models for nonlinear regression and classification, with the performances of these models demonstrated on extensive benchmark datasets and compared to state-of-the-art competing results."}
{"text": "Rapid overlay of chemical structures (ROCS) is a standard tool for the calculation of 3D shape and chemical (\"color\") similarity. ROCS uses unweighted sums to combine many aspects of similarity, yielding parameter-free models for virtual screening. In this report, we decompose the ROCS color force field into \"color components\" and \"color atom overlaps\", novel color similarity features that can be weighted in a system-specific manner by machine learning algorithms. In cross-validation experiments, these additional features significantly improve virtual screening performance (ROC AUC scores) relative to standard ROCS."}
{"text": "Clustering is one of the most important unsupervised problems in machine learning and statistics. Among many existing algorithms, kernel k-means has drawn much research attention due to its ability to find non-linear cluster boundaries and its inherent simplicity. There are two main approaches for kernel k-means: SVD of the kernel matrix and convex relaxations. Despite the attention kernel clustering has received both from theoretical and applied quarters, not much is known about robustness of the methods. In this paper we first introduce a semidefinite programming relaxation for the kernel clustering problem, then prove that under a suitable model specification, both the K-SVD and SDP approaches are consistent in the limit, albeit SDP is strongly consistent, i.e. achieves exact recovery, whereas K-SVD is weakly consistent, i.e. the fraction of misclassified nodes vanish."}
{"text": "Monte Carlo (MC) sampling algorithms are an extremely widely-used technique to estimate expectations of functions f(x), especially in high dimensions. Control variates are a very powerful technique to reduce the error of such estimates, but in their conventional form rely on having an accurate approximation of f, a priori. Stacked Monte Carlo (StackMC) is a recently introduced technique designed to overcome this limitation by fitting a control variate to the data samples themselves. Done naively, forming a control variate to the data would result in overfitting, typically worsening the MC algorithm's performance. StackMC uses in-sample / out-sample techniques to remove this overfitting. Crucially, it is a post-processing technique, requiring no additional samples, and can be applied to data generated by any MC estimator. Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that StackMC improved the estimates of expectations when it was used to post-process samples produces by a \"simple sampling\" MC estimator. Here we substantially extend this earlier work. We provide an in-depth analysis of the StackMC algorithm, which we use to construct an improved version of the original algorithm, with lower estimation error. We then perform experiments of StackMC on several additional kinds of MC estimators, demonstrating improved performance when the samples are generated via importance sampling, Latin-hypercube sampling and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. We also show how to extend StackMC to combine multiple fitting functions, and how to apply it to discrete input spaces x."}
{"text": "The vast majority of the neural network literature focuses on predicting point values for a given set of response variables, conditioned on a feature vector. In many cases we need to model the full joint conditional distribution over the response variables rather than simply making point predictions. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to such conditional density estimation (CDE): Multiscale Nets (MSNs) and CDE Trend Filtering. Multiscale nets transform the CDE regression task into a hierarchical classification task by decomposing the density into a series of half-spaces and learning boolean probabilities of each split. CDE Trend Filtering applies a k-th order graph trend filtering penalty to the unnormalized logits of a multinomial classifier network, with each edge in the graph corresponding to a neighboring point on a discretized version of the density. We compare both methods against plain multinomial classifier networks and mixture density networks (MDNs) on a simulated dataset and three real-world datasets. The results suggest the two methods are complementary: MSNs work well in a high-data-per-feature regime and CDE-TF is well suited for few-samples-per-feature scenarios where overfitting is a primary concern."}
{"text": "The multivariate normal density is a monotonic function of the distance to the mean, and its ellipsoidal shape is due to the underlying Euclidean metric. We suggest to replace this metric with a locally adaptive, smoothly changing (Riemannian) metric that favors regions of high local density. The resulting locally adaptive normal distribution (LAND) is a generalization of the normal distribution to the \"manifold\" setting, where data is assumed to lie near a potentially low-dimensional manifold embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^D$. The LAND is parametric, depending only on a mean and a covariance, and is the maximum entropy distribution under the given metric. The underlying metric is, however, non-parametric. We develop a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer the distribution parameters that relies on a combination of gradient descent and Monte Carlo integration. We further extend the LAND to mixture models, and provide the corresponding EM algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of the LAND to fit non-trivial probability distributions over both synthetic data, and EEG measurements of human sleep."}
{"text": "This paper considers the quantification of the prediction performance in Gaussian process regression. The standard approach is to base the prediction error bars on the theoretical predictive variance, which is a lower bound on the mean square-error (MSE). This approach, however, does not take into account that the statistical model is learned from the data. We show that this omission leads to a systematic underestimation of the prediction errors. Starting from a generalization of the Cram\\'er-Rao bound, we derive a more accurate MSE bound which provides a measure of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes. The improved bound is easily computed and we illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples. of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes and illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples."}
{"text": "In this paper we develop a method for learning nonlinear systems with multiple outputs and inputs. We begin by modelling the errors of a nominal predictor of the system using a latent variable framework. Then using the maximum likelihood principle we derive a criterion for learning the model. The resulting optimization problem is tackled using a majorization-minimization approach. Finally, we develop a convex majorization technique and show that it enables a recursive identification method. The method learns parsimonious predictive models and is tested on both synthetic and real nonlinear systems."}
{"text": "We introduce Network Maximal Correlation (NMC) as a multivariate measure of nonlinear association among random variables. NMC is defined via an optimization that infers transformations of variables by maximizing aggregate inner products between transformed variables. For finite discrete and jointly Gaussian random variables, we characterize a solution of the NMC optimization using basis expansion of functions over appropriate basis functions. For finite discrete variables, we propose an algorithm based on alternating conditional expectation to determine NMC. Moreover we propose a distributed algorithm to compute an approximation of NMC for large and dense graphs using graph partitioning. For finite discrete variables, we show that the probability of discrepancy greater than any given level between NMC and NMC computed using empirical distributions decays exponentially fast as the sample size grows. For jointly Gaussian variables, we show that under some conditions the NMC optimization is an instance of the Max-Cut problem. We then illustrate an application of NMC in inference of graphical model for bijective functions of jointly Gaussian variables. Finally, we show NMC's utility in a data application of learning nonlinear dependencies among genes in a cancer dataset."}
{"text": "Good sparse approximations are essential for practical inference in Gaussian Processes as the computational cost of exact methods is prohibitive for large datasets. The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) and the Variational Free Energy (VFE) approximations are two recent popular methods. Despite superficial similarities, these approximations have surprisingly different theoretical properties and behave differently in practice. We thoroughly investigate the two methods for regression both analytically and through illustrative examples, and draw conclusions to guide practical application."}
{"text": "Decoding, ie prediction from brain images or signals, calls for empirical evaluation of its predictive power. Such evaluation is achieved via cross-validation, a method also used to tune decoders' hyper-parameters. This paper is a review on cross-validation procedures for decoding in neuroimaging. It includes a didactic overview of the relevant theoretical considerations. Practical aspects are highlighted with an extensive empirical study of the common decoders in within-and across-subject predictions, on multiple datasets --anatomical and functional MRI and MEG-- and simulations. Theory and experiments outline that the popular \" leave-one-out \" strategy leads to unstable and biased estimates, and a repeated random splits method should be preferred. Experiments outline the large error bars of cross-validation in neuroimaging settings: typical confidence intervals of 10%. Nested cross-validation can tune decoders' parameters while avoiding circularity bias. However we find that it can be more favorable to use sane defaults, in particular for non-sparse decoders."}
{"text": "We introduce the Mondrian kernel, a fast random feature approximation to the Laplace kernel. It is suitable for both batch and online learning, and admits a fast kernel-width-selection procedure as the random features can be re-used efficiently for all kernel widths. The features are constructed by sampling trees via a Mondrian process [Roy and Teh, 2009], and we highlight the connection to Mondrian forests [Lakshminarayanan et al., 2014], where trees are also sampled via a Mondrian process, but fit independently. This link provides a new insight into the relationship between kernel methods and random forests."}
{"text": "Regression trees are becoming increasingly popular as omnibus predicting tools and as the basis of numerous modern statistical learning ensembles. Part of their popularity is their ability to create a regression prediction without ever specifying a structure for the mean model. However, the method implicitly assumes homogeneous variance across the entire explanatory-variable space. It is unknown how the algorithm behaves when faced with heteroscedastic data. In this study, we assess the performance of the most popular regression-tree algorithm in a single-variable setting under a very simple step-function model for heteroscedasticity. We use simulation to show that the locations of splits, and hence the ability to accurately predict means, are both adversely influenced by the change in variance. We identify the pruning algorithm as the main concern, although the effects on the splitting algorithm may be meaningful in some applications."}
{"text": "Tree ensembles, such as random forest and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance, whereas their interpretability is critically limited. In this paper, we propose a post processing method that improves the model interpretability of tree ensembles. After learning a complex tree ensembles in a standard way, we approximate it by a simpler model that is interpretable for human. To obtain the simpler model, we derive the EM algorithm minimizing the KL divergence from the complex ensemble. A synthetic experiment showed that a complicated tree ensemble was approximated reasonably as interpretable."}
{"text": "This paper discusses about an R package that implements the Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been successfully applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction. The clustering part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its implementation with minimum efforts. This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also provides a simple example of usage. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository."}
{"text": "Improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of brain decoding models. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, we present a simple definition for interpretability of linear brain decoding models. Then, we propose to combine the interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our preliminary results on the toy data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative linear models. The presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability in linear brain decoding."}
{"text": "In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a group sparse vector from a small number of linear measurements. In the past the common approach has been to use various \"group sparsity-inducing\" norms such as the Group LASSO norm for this purpose. By using the theory of convex relaxations, we show that it is also possible to use $\\ell_1$-norm minimization for group sparse recovery. We introduce a new concept called group robust null space property (GRNSP), and show that, under suitable conditions, a group version of the restricted isometry property (GRIP) implies the GRNSP, and thus leads to group sparse recovery. When all groups are of equal size, our bounds are less conservative than known bounds. Moreover, our results apply even to situations where where the groups have different sizes. When specialized to conventional sparsity, our bounds reduce to one of the well-known \"best possible\" conditions for sparse recovery. This relationship between GRNSP and GRIP is new even for conventional sparsity, and substantially streamlines the proofs of some known results. Using this relationship, we derive bounds on the $\\ell_p$-norm of the residual error vector for all $p \\in [1,2]$, and not just when $p = 2$. When the measurement matrix consists of random samples of a sub-Gaussian random variable, we present bounds on the number of measurements, which are less conservative than currently known bounds."}
{"text": "We consider training probabilistic classifiers in the case of a large number of classes. The number of classes is assumed too large to perform exact normalisation over all classes. To account for this we consider a simple approach that directly approximates the likelihood. We show that this simple approach works well on toy problems and is competitive with recently introduced alternative non-likelihood based approximations. Furthermore, we relate this approach to a simple ranking objective. This leads us to suggest a specific setting for the optimal threshold in the ranking objective."}
{"text": "We study a two-level multiview learning with more than two views under the PAC-Bayesian framework. This approach, sometimes referred as late fusion, consists in learning sequentially multiple view-specific classifiers at the first level, and then combining these view-specific classifiers at the second level. Our main theoretical result is a generalization bound on the risk of the majority vote which exhibits a term of diversity in the predictions of the view-specific classifiers. From this result it comes out that controlling the trade-off between diversity and accuracy is a key element for multiview learning, which complements other results in multiview learning. Finally, we experiment our principle on multiview datasets extracted from the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collection."}
{"text": "We propose a probabilistic modeling framework for learning the dynamic patterns in the collective behaviors of social agents and developing profiles for different behavioral groups, using data collected from multiple information sources. The proposed model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian process, in which each observation is a finite mixture of an set of latent groups and the mixture proportions (i.e., group probabilities) are drawn randomly. Each group is associated with some distributions over a finite set of outcomes. Moreover, as time evolves, the structure of these groups also changes; we model the change in the group structure by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a fixed transition probability. We present an efficient inference method based on tensor decompositions and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation."}
{"text": "When observations are organized into groups where commonalties exist amongst them, the dependent random measures can be an ideal choice for modeling. One of the propositions of the dependent random measures is that the atoms of the posterior distribution are shared amongst groups, and hence groups can borrow information from each other. When normalized dependent random measures prior with independent increments are applied, we can derive appropriate exchangeable probability partition function (EPPF), and subsequently also deduce its inference algorithm given any mixture model likelihood. We provide all necessary derivation and solution to this framework. For demonstration, we used mixture of Gaussians likelihood in combination with a dependent structure constructed by linear combinations of CRMs. Our experiments show superior performance when using this framework, where the inferred values including the mixing weights and the number of clusters both respond appropriately to the number of completely random measure used."}

The paper introduces a new abnormality measure for decision making. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

{"text": "This paper proposes a novel dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process topic model that considers the dependence between successive observations. Conventional posterior inference algorithms for this kind of models require processing of the whole data through several passes. It is computationally intractable for massive or sequential data. We design the batch and online inference algorithms, based on the Gibbs sampling, for the proposed model. It allows to process sequential data, incrementally updating the model by a new observation. The model is applied to abnormal behaviour detection in video sequences. A new abnormality measure is proposed for decision making. The proposed method is compared with the method based on the non- dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, for which we also derive the online Gibbs sampler and the abnormality measure. The results with synthetic and real data show that the consideration of the dynamics in a topic model improves the classification performance for abnormal behaviour detection."}
{"text": "Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a framework for performing likelihood-free posterior inference for simulation models. Stochastic Variational inference (SVI) is an appealing alternative to the inefficient sampling approaches commonly used in ABC. However, SVI is highly sensitive to the variance of the gradient estimators, and this problem is exacerbated by approximating the likelihood. We draw upon recent advances in variance reduction for SV and likelihood-free inference using deterministic simulations to produce low variance gradient estimators of the variational lower-bound. By then exploiting automatic differentiation libraries we can avoid nearly all model-specific derivations. We demonstrate performance on three problems and compare to existing SVI algorithms. Our results demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm."}
{"text": "Deep learning methods such as multitask neural networks have recently been applied to ligand-based virtual screening and other drug discovery applications. Using a set of industrial ADMET datasets, we compare neural networks to standard baseline models and analyze multitask learning effects with both random cross-validation and a more relevant temporal validation scheme. We confirm that multitask learning can provide modest benefits over single-task models and show that smaller datasets tend to benefit more than larger datasets from multitask learning. Additionally, we find that adding massive amounts of side information is not guaranteed to improve performance relative to simpler multitask learning. Our results emphasize that multitask effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the use of dataset-specific models to maximize overall performance."}
{"text": "Contagions such as the spread of popular news stories, or infectious diseases, propagate in cascades over dynamic networks with unobservable topologies. However, \"social signals\" such as product purchase time, or blog entry timestamps are measurable, and implicitly depend on the underlying topology, making it possible to track it over time. Interestingly, network topologies often \"jump\" between discrete states that may account for sudden changes in the observed signals. The present paper advocates a switched dynamic structural equation model to capture the topology-dependent cascade evolution, as well as the discrete states driving the underlying topologies. Conditions under which the proposed switched model is identifiable are established. Leveraging the edge sparsity inherent to social networks, a recursive $\\ell_1$-norm regularized least-squares estimator is put forth to jointly track the states and network topologies. An efficient first-order proximal-gradient algorithm is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Numerical experiments on both synthetic data and real cascades measured over the span of one year are conducted, and test results corroborate the efficacy of the advocated approach."}
{"text": "We consider learning high-dimensional multi-response linear models with structured parameters. By exploiting the noise correlations among responses, we propose an alternating estimation (AltEst) procedure to estimate the model parameters based on the generalized Dantzig selector. Under suitable sample size and resampling assumptions, we show that the error of the estimates generated by AltEst, with high probability, converges linearly to certain minimum achievable level, which can be tersely expressed by a few geometric measures, such as Gaussian width of sets related to the parameter structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-asymptotic statistical guarantee for such AltEst-type algorithm applied to estimation problem with general structures."}
{"text": "Tree ensembles, such as random forests and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance. However, their interpretability is critically limited due to the enormous complexity. In this study, we present a method to make a complex tree ensemble interpretable by simplifying the model. Specifically, we formalize the simplification of tree ensembles as a model selection problem. Given a complex tree ensemble, we aim at obtaining the simplest representation that is essentially equivalent to the original one. To this end, we derive a Bayesian model selection algorithm that optimizes the simplified model while maintaining the prediction performance. Our numerical experiments on several datasets showed that complicated tree ensembles were reasonably approximated as interpretable."}
{"text": "The problem of finding overlapping communities in networks has gained much attention recently. Optimization-based approaches use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or variants, but the global optimum cannot be provably attained in general. Model-based approaches, such as the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel or MMSB (Airoldi et al., 2008), use parameters for each node to specify the overlapping communities, but standard inference techniques cannot guarantee consistency. We link the two approaches, by (a) establishing sufficient conditions for the symmetric NMF optimization to have a unique solution under MMSB, and (b) proposing a computationally efficient algorithm called GeoNMF that is provably optimal and hence consistent for a broad parameter regime. We demonstrate its accuracy on both simulated and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites play an important role in addressing health information needs. However, a significant number of posted questions remain unanswered. Automatically answering the posted questions can provide a useful source of information for online health communities. In this study, we developed an algorithm to automatically answer health-related questions based on past questions and answers (QA). We also aimed to understand information embedded within online health content that are good features in identifying valid answers. Our proposed algorithm uses information retrieval techniques to identify candidate answers from resolved QA. In order to rank these candidates, we implemented a semi-supervised leaning algorithm that extracts the best answer to a question. We assessed this approach on a curated corpus from Yahoo! Answers and compared against a rule-based string similarity baseline. On our dataset, the semi-supervised learning algorithm has an accuracy of 86.2%. UMLS-based (health-related) features used in the model enhance the algorithm's performance by proximately 8 %. A reasonably high rate of accuracy is obtained given that the data is considerably noisy. Important features distinguishing a valid answer from an invalid answer include text length, number of stop words contained in a test question, a distance between the test question and other questions in the corpus as well as a number of overlapping health-related terms between questions. Overall, our automated QA system based on historical QA pairs is shown to be effective according to the data set in this case study. It is developed for general use in the health care domain which can also be applied to other CQA sites."}
{"text": "Probabilistic programming languages represent complex data with intermingled models in a few lines of code. Efficient inference algorithms in probabilistic programming languages make possible to build unified frameworks to compute interesting probabilities of various large, real-world problems. When the structure of model is given, constructing a probabilistic program is rather straightforward. Thus, main focus have been to learn the best model parameters and compute marginal probabilities. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to build expressive probabilistic program from continue time series data when the structure of model is not given. The intuition behind of our method is to find a descriptive covariance structure of time series data in nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We report that such descriptive covariance structure efficiently derives a probabilistic programming description accurately."}
{"text": "Given a graph in which a few vertices are deemed interesting a priori, the vertex nomination task is to order the remaining vertices into a nomination list such that there is a concentration of interesting vertices at the top of the list. Previous work has yielded several approaches to this problem, with theoretical results in the setting where the graph is drawn from a stochastic block model (SBM), including a vertex nomination analogue of the Bayes optimal classifier. In this paper, we prove that maximum likelihood (ML)-based vertex nomination is consistent, in the sense that the performance of the ML-based scheme asymptotically matches that of the Bayes optimal scheme. We prove theorems of this form both when model parameters are known and unknown. Additionally, we introduce and prove consistency of a related, more scalable restricted-focus ML vertex nomination scheme. Finally, we incorporate vertex and edge features into ML-based vertex nomination and briefly explore the empirical effectiveness of this approach."}
{"text": "We propose a Bayesian nonparametric prior for time-varying networks. To each node of the network is associated a positive parameter, modeling the sociability of that node. Sociabilities are assumed to evolve over time, and are modeled via a dynamic point process model. The model is able to (a) capture smooth evolution of the interaction between nodes, allowing edges to appear/disappear over time (b) capture long term evolution of the sociabilities of the nodes (c) and yield sparse graphs, where the number of edges grows subquadratically with the number of nodes. The evolution of the sociabilities is described by a tractable time-varying gamma process. We provide some theoretical insights into the model and apply it to three real world datasets."}
{"text": "We propose a vector-valued regression problem whose solution is equivalent to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding of the Bayesian posterior distribution. This equivalence provides a new understanding of kernel Bayesian inference. Moreover, the optimization problem induces a new regularization for the posterior embedding estimator, which is faster and has comparable performance to the squared regularization in kernel Bayes' rule. This regularization coincides with a former thresholding approach used in kernel POMDPs whose consistency remains to be established. Our theoretical work solves this open problem and provides consistency analysis in regression settings. Based on our optimizational formulation, we propose a flexible Bayesian posterior regularization framework which for the first time enables us to put regularization at the distribution level. We apply this method to nonparametric state-space filtering tasks with extremely nonlinear dynamics and show performance gains over all other baselines."}
{"text": "We present a general framework for classifying partially observed dynamical systems based on the idea of learning in the model space. In contrast to the existing approaches using model point estimates to represent individual data items, we employ posterior distributions over models, thus taking into account in a principled manner the uncertainty due to both the generative (observational and/or dynamic noise) and observation (sampling in time) processes. We evaluate the framework on two testbeds - a biological pathway model and a stochastic double-well system. Crucially, we show that the classifier performance is not impaired when the model class used for inferring posterior distributions is much more simple than the observation-generating model class, provided the reduced complexity inferential model class captures the essential characteristics needed for the given classification task."}
{"text": "Additive nonparametric regression models provide an attractive tool for variable selection in high dimensions when the relationship between the response and predictors is complex. They offer greater flexibility compared to parametric non-linear regression models and better interpretability and scalability than the non-parametric regression models. However, achieving sparsity simultaneously in the number of nonparametric components as well as in the variables within each nonparametric component poses a stiff computational challenge. In this article, we develop a novel Bayesian additive regression model using a combination of hard and soft shrinkages to separately control the number of additive components and the variables within each component. An efficient algorithm is developed to select the importance variables and estimate the interaction network. Excellent performance is obtained in simulated and real data examples."}
{"text": "Ensemble of regression trees have become popular statistical tools for the estimation of conditional mean given a set of predictors. However, quantile regression trees and their ensembles have not yet garnered much attention despite the increasing popularity of the linear quantile regression model. This work proposes a Bayesian quantile additive regression trees model that shows very good predictive performance illustrated using simulation studies and real data applications. Further extension to tackle binary classification problems is also considered."}
{"text": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) exploits Hamiltonian dynamics to construct efficient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we present a generalization of HMC which exploits \\textit{non-canonical} Hamiltonian dynamics. We refer to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dynamics map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field. We establish a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples where these non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary HMC."}
{"text": "We present new methods to estimate causal effects retrospectively from micro data with the assistance of a machine learning ensemble. This approach overcomes two important limitations in conventional methods like regression modeling or matching: (i) ambiguity about the pertinent retrospective counterfactuals and (ii) potential misspecification, overfitting, and otherwise bias-prone or inefficient use of a large identifying covariate set in the estimation of causal effects. Our method targets the analysis toward a well defined ``retrospective intervention effect'' (RIE) based on hypothetical population interventions and applies a machine learning ensemble that allows data to guide us, in a controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set. We illustrate with an analysis of policy options for reducing ex-combatant recidivism in Colombia."}
{"text": "Machine learning is the science of discovering statistical dependencies in data, and the use of those dependencies to perform predictions. During the last decade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human performance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and computer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning avoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way forward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human intelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms.   Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships between the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide understanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen environments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer \"what if\" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under hypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and effect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine intelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in specific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in practice.   This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways. First, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on copulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret the problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification, yielding a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover causal structures in convolutional neural network features using our algorithms. The algorithms presented in this thesis are scalable, exhibit strong theoretical guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of real-world benchmarks."}
{"text": "Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as mixture models, are used for cluster analysis. These models have two types of variables: observable and latent. In cluster analysis, the latent variable is estimated, and it is expected that additional information will improve the accuracy of the estimation of the latent variable. Many proposed learning methods are able to use additional data; these include semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. However, from a statistical point of view, a complex probabilistic model that encompasses both the initial and additional data might be less accurate due to having a higher-dimensional parameter. The present paper presents a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of such a model and clarifies which factor has the greatest effect on its accuracy, the advantages of obtaining additional data, and the disadvantages of increasing the complexity."}
{"text": "We study the density estimation problem with observations generated by certain dynamical systems that admit a unique underlying invariant Lebesgue density. Observations drawn from dynamical systems are not independent and moreover, usual mixing concepts may not be appropriate for measuring the dependence among these observations. By employing the $\\mathcal{C}$-mixing concept to measure the dependence, we conduct statistical analysis on the consistency and convergence of the kernel density estimator. Our main results are as follows: First, we show that with properly chosen bandwidth, the kernel density estimator is universally consistent under $L_1$-norm; Second, we establish convergence rates for the estimator with respect to several classes of dynamical systems under $L_1$-norm. In the analysis, the density function $f$ is only assumed to be H\\\"{o}lder continuous which is a weak assumption in the literature of nonparametric density estimation and also more realistic in the dynamical system context. Last but not least, we prove that the same convergence rates of the estimator under $L_\\infty$-norm and $L_1$-norm can be achieved when the density function is H\\\"{o}lder continuous, compactly supported and bounded. The bandwidth selection problem of the kernel density estimator for dynamical system is also discussed in our study via numerical simulations."}
{"text": "An important problem in sequential decision-making under uncertainty is to use limited data to compute a safe policy, i.e., a policy that is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a given baseline strategy. In this paper, we develop and analyze a new model-based approach to compute a safe policy when we have access to an inaccurate dynamics model of the system with known accuracy guarantees. Our proposed robust method uses this (inaccurate) model to directly minimize the (negative) regret w.r.t. the baseline policy. Contrary to the existing approaches, minimizing the regret allows one to improve the baseline policy in states with accurate dynamics and seamlessly fall back to the baseline policy, otherwise. We show that our formulation is NP-hard and propose an approximate algorithm. Our empirical results on several domains show that even this relatively simple approximate algorithm can significantly outperform standard approaches."}
{"text": "Spectral embedding uses eigenfunctions of the discrete Laplacian on a weighted graph to obtain coordinates for an embedding of an abstract data set into Euclidean space. We propose a new pre-processing step of first using the eigenfunctions to simulate a low-frequency wave moving over the data and using both position as well as change in time of the wave to obtain a refined metric to which classical methods of dimensionality reduction can then applied. This is motivated by the behavior of waves, symmetries of the wave equation and the hunting technique of bats. It is shown to be effective in practice and also works for other partial differential equations -- the method yields improved results even for the classical heat equation."}
{"text": "This work falls within the context of predicting the value of a real function at some input locations given a limited number of observations of this function. The Kriging interpolation technique (or Gaussian process regression) is often considered to tackle such a problem but the method suffers from its computational burden when the number of observation points is large. We introduce in this article nested Kriging predictors which are constructed by aggregating sub-models based on subsets of observation points. This approach is proven to have better theoretical properties than other aggregation methods that can be found in the literature. Contrarily to some other methods it can be shown that the proposed aggregation method is consistent. Finally, the practical interest of the proposed method is illustrated on simulated datasets and on an industrial test case with $10^4$ observations in a 6-dimensional space."}
{"text": "Concentration inequalities are indispensable tools for studying the generalization capacity of learning models. Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities are commonly used, giving bounds independent of the data distribution. Although this makes them widely applicable, a drawback is that the bounds can be too loose in some specific cases. Although efforts have been devoted to improving the bounds, we find that the bounds can be further tightened in some distribution-dependent scenarios and conditions for the inequalities can be relaxed. In particular, we propose four types of conditions for probabilistic boundedness and bounded differences, and derive several distribution-dependent extensions of Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities. These extensions provide bounds for functions not satisfying the conditions of the existing inequalities, and in some special cases, tighter bounds. Furthermore, we obtain generalization bounds for unbounded and hierarchy-bounded loss functions. Finally we discuss the potential applications of our extensions to learning theory."}
{"text": "We propose a method that performs anomaly detection and localisation within heterogeneous data using a pairwise undirected mixed graphical model. The data are a mixture of categorical and quantitative variables, and the model is learned over a dataset that is supposed not to contain any anomaly. We then use the model over temporal data, potentially a data stream, using a version of the two-sided CUSUM algorithm. The proposed decision statistic is based on a conditional likelihood ratio computed for each variable given the others. Our results show that this function allows to detect anomalies variable by variable, and thus to localise the variables involved in the anomalies more precisely than univariate methods based on simple marginals."}
{"text": "Most high-dimensional estimation and prediction methods propose to minimize a cost function (empirical risk) that is written as a sum of losses associated to each data point. In this paper we focus on the case of non-convex losses, which is practically important but still poorly understood. Classical empirical process theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting M-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently.   In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to study the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and their properties. We establish uniform convergence of the gradient and Hessian of the empirical risk to their population counterparts, as soon as the number of samples becomes larger than the number of unknown parameters (modulo logarithmic factors). Consequently, good properties of the population risk can be carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one correspondence of their stationary points. We demonstrate that in several problems such as non-convex binary classification, robust regression, and Gaussian mixture model, this result implies a complete characterization of the landscape of the empirical risk, and of the convergence properties of descent algorithms.   We extend our analysis to the very high-dimensional setting in which the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, and provide a characterization of the empirical risk landscape under a nearly information-theoretically minimal condition. Namely, if the number of samples exceeds the sparsity of the unknown parameters vector (modulo logarithmic factors), then a suitable uniform convergence result takes place. We apply this result to non-convex binary classification and robust regression in very high-dimension."}
{"text": "Mixture models with Gamma and or inverse-Gamma distributed mixture components are useful for medical image tissue segmentation or as post-hoc models for regression coefficients obtained from linear regression within a Generalised Linear Modeling framework (GLM), used in this case to separate stochastic (Gaussian) noise from some kind of positive or negative \"activation\" (modeled as Gamma or inverse-Gamma distributed). To date, the most common choice in this context it is Gaussian/Gamma mixture models learned through a maximum likelihood (ML) approach; we recently extended such algorithm for mixture models with inverse-Gamma components. Here, we introduce a fully analytical Variational Bayes (VB) learning framework for both Gamma and/or inverse-Gamma components. We use synthetic and resting state fMRI data to compare the performance of the ML and VB algorithms in terms of area under the curve and computational cost. We observed that the ML Gaussian/Gamma model is very expensive specially when considering high resolution images; furthermore, these solutions are highly variable and they occasionally can overestimate the activations severely. The Bayesian Gauss-Gamma is in general the fastest algorithm but provides too dense solutions. The maximum likelihood Gaussian/inverse-Gamma is also very fast but provides in general very sparse solutions. The variational Gaussian/inverse-Gamma mixture model is the most robust and its cost is acceptable even for high resolution images. Further, the presented methodology represents an essential building block that can be directly used in more complex inference tasks, specially designed to analyse MRI-fMRI data; such models include for example analytical variational mixture models with adaptive spatial regularization or better source models for new spatial blind source separation approaches."}
{"text": "Preterm births occur at an alarming rate of 10-15%. Preemies have a higher risk of infant mortality, developmental retardation and long-term disabilities. Predicting preterm birth is difficult, even for the most experienced clinicians. The most well-designed clinical study thus far reaches a modest sensitivity of 18.2-24.2% at specificity of 28.6-33.3%. We take a different approach by exploiting databases of normal hospital operations. We aims are twofold: (i) to derive an easy-to-use, interpretable prediction rule with quantified uncertainties, and (ii) to construct accurate classifiers for preterm birth prediction. Our approach is to automatically generate and select from hundreds (if not thousands) of possible predictors using stability-aware techniques. Derived from a large database of 15,814 women, our simplified prediction rule with only 10 items has sensitivity of 62.3% at specificity of 81.5%."}
{"text": "We prove a central limit theorem for the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to the $d$ largest eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix of a finite dimensional random dot product graph. As a corollary, we show that for stochastic blockmodel graphs, the rows of the spectral embedding of the normalized Laplacian converge to multivariate normals and furthermore the mean and the covariance matrix of each row are functions of the associated vertex's block membership. Together with prior results for the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, we then compare, via the Chernoff information between multivariate normal distributions, how the choice of embedding method impacts subsequent inference. We demonstrate that neither embedding method dominates with respect to the inference task of recovering the latent block assignments."}
{"text": "Nonlinear similarity measures defined in kernel space, such as correntropy, can extract higher-order statistics of data and offer potentially significant performance improvement over their linear counterparts especially in non-Gaussian signal processing and machine learning. In this work, we propose a new similarity measure in kernel space, called the kernel risk-sensitive loss (KRSL), and provide some important properties. We apply the KRSL to adaptive filtering and investigate the robustness, and then develop the MKRSL algorithm and analyze the mean square convergence performance. Compared with correntropy, the KRSL can offer a more efficient performance surface, thereby enabling a gradient based method to achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy while still maintaining the robustness to outliers. Theoretical analysis results and superior performance of the new algorithm are confirmed by simulation."}
{"text": "We study probability measures induced by set functions with constraints. Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds."}
{"text": "We study the problem of demixing a pair of sparse signals from noisy, nonlinear observations of their superposition. Mathematically, we consider a nonlinear signal observation model, $y_i = g(a_i^Tx) + e_i, \\ i=1,\\ldots,m$, where $x = \\Phi w+\\Psi z$ denotes the superposition signal, $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ are orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and $w, z\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ are sparse coefficient vectors of the constituent signals, and $e_i$ represents the noise. Moreover, $g$ represents a nonlinear link function, and $a_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $i$-th row of the measurement matrix, $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$. Problems of this nature arise in several applications ranging from astronomy, computer vision, and machine learning. In this paper, we make some concrete algorithmic progress for the above demixing problem. Specifically, we consider two scenarios: (i) the case when the demixing procedure has no knowledge of the link function, and (ii) the case when the demixing algorithm has perfect knowledge of the link function. In both cases, we provide fast algorithms for recovery of the constituents $w$ and $z$ from the observations. Moreover, we support these algorithms with a rigorous theoretical analysis, and derive (nearly) tight upper bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms for achieving stable recovery of the component signals. We also provide a range of numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms on both real and synthetic signals and images."}
{"text": "A genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlates marker variation with trait variation in a sample of individuals. Each study subject is genotyped at a multitude of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) spanning the genome. Here we assume that subjects are unrelated and collected at random and that trait values are normally distributed or transformed to normality. Over the past decade, researchers have been remarkably successful in applying GWAS analysis to hundreds of traits. The massive amount of data produced in these studies present unique computational challenges. Penalized regression with LASSO or MCP penalties is capable of selecting a handful of associated SNPs from millions of potential SNPs. Unfortunately, model selection can be corrupted by false positives and false negatives, obscuring the genetic underpinning of a trait. This paper introduces the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm to the GWAS analysis of continuous traits. Our parallel implementation of IHT accommodates SNP genotype compression and exploits multiple CPU cores and graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows statistical geneticists to leverage commodity desktop computers in GWAS analysis and to avoid supercomputing. We evaluate IHT performance on both simulated and real GWAS data and conclude that it reduces false positive and false negative rates while remaining competitive in computational time with penalized regression.

In that method, the basin of attraction for valid initialization is required to be a ball around the truth. Using Stein's Lemma, we extend these results in the case of estimating the centers of a two-component Gaussian mixture in $d$ dimensions. In particular, we significantly expand the basin of attraction to be the intersection of a half space and a ball around the origin. If the signal-to-noise ratio is at least a constant multiple of $ \\sqrt{d\\log d} $, we show that a random initialization strategy is feasible."}
{"text": "Boosting combines weak (biased) learners to obtain effective learning algorithms for classification and prediction. In this paper, we show a connection between boosting and kernel-based methods, highlighting both theoretical and practical applications. In the context of $\\ell_2$ boosting, we start with a weak linear learner defined by a kernel $K$. We show that boosting with this learner is equivalent to estimation with a special {\\it boosting kernel} that depends on $K$, as well as on the regression matrix, noise variance, and hyperparameters. The number of boosting iterations is modeled as a continuous hyperparameter, and fit along with other parameters using standard techniques.   We then generalize the boosting kernel to a broad new class of boosting approaches for more general weak learners, including those based on the $\\ell_1$, hinge and Vapnik losses. The approach allows fast hyperparameter tuning for this general class, and has a wide range of applications, including robust regression and classification. We illustrate some of these applications with numerical examples on synthetic and real data."}
{"text": "Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) are powerful models for sequential data but they do not scale well with long sequences. We propose a scalable inference and learning algorithm for FHMMs that draws on ideas from the stochastic variational inference, neural network and copula literatures. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed algorithm requires no message passing procedure among latent variables and can be distributed to a network of computers to speed up learning. Our experiments corroborate that the proposed algorithm does not introduce further approximation bias compared to the proven structured mean-field algorithm, and achieves better performance with long sequences and large FHMMs."}
{"text": "Machine learning methods are used to discover complex nonlinear relationships in biological and medical data. However, sophisticated learning models are computationally unfeasible for data with millions of features. Here we introduce the first feature selection method for nonlinear learning problems that can scale up to large, ultra-high dimensional biological data. More specifically, we scale up the novel Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion Lasso (HSIC Lasso) to handle millions of features with tens of thousand samples. The proposed method is guaranteed to find an optimal subset of maximally predictive features with minimal redundancy, yielding higher predictive power and improved interpretability. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through applications to classify phenotypes based on module expression in human prostate cancer patients and to detect enzymes among protein structures. We achieve high accuracy with as few as 20 out of one million features --- a dimensionality reduction of 99.998%. Our algorithm can be implemented on commodity cloud computing platforms. The dramatic reduction of features may lead to the ubiquitous deployment of sophisticated prediction models in mobile health care applications."}
{"text": "This paper considers \\emph{volume minimization} (VolMin)-based structured matrix factorization (SMF). VolMin is a factorization criterion that decomposes a given data matrix into a basis matrix times a structured coefficient matrix via finding the minimum-volume simplex that encloses all the columns of the data matrix. Recent work showed that VolMin guarantees the identifiability of the factor matrices under mild conditions that are realistic in a wide variety of applications. This paper focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of VolMin. On the theory side, exact equivalence of two independently developed sufficient conditions for VolMin identifiability is proven here, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of this aspect of VolMin. On the algorithm side, computational complexity and sensitivity to outliers are two key challenges associated with real-world applications of VolMin. These are addressed here via a new VolMin algorithm that handles volume regularization in a computationally simple way, and automatically detects and {iteratively downweights} outliers, simultaneously. Simulations and real-data experiments using a remotely sensed hyperspectral image and the Reuters document corpus are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "Datasets with a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes are routinely encountered in many application domains. In this work we examine an approach to clustering such datasets using homogeneity analysis. Homogeneity analysis determines a euclidean representation of the data. This can be analyzed by leveraging the large body of tools and techniques for data with a euclidean representation. Experiments conducted as part of this study suggest that this approach can be useful in the analysis and exploration of big datasets with a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes."}
{"text": "Exploration of hydrocarbon resources is a highly complicated and expensive process where various geological, geochemical and geophysical factors are developed then combined together. It is highly significant how to design the seismic data acquisition survey and locate the exploratory wells since incorrect or imprecise locations lead to waste of time and money during the operation. The objective of this study is to locate high-potential oil and gas field in 1: 250,000 sheet of Ahwaz including 20 oil fields to reduce both time and costs in exploration and production processes. In this regard, 17 maps were developed using GIS functions for factors including: minimum and maximum of total organic carbon (TOC), yield potential for hydrocarbons production (PP), Tmax peak, production index (PI), oxygen index (OI), hydrogen index (HI) as well as presence or proximity to high residual Bouguer gravity anomalies, proximity to anticline axis and faults, topography and curvature maps obtained from Asmari Formation subsurface contours. To model and to integrate maps, this study employed artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The results obtained from model validation demonstrated that the 17x10x5 neural network with R=0.8948, RMS=0.0267, and kappa=0.9079 can be trained better than other models such as ANFIS and predicts the potential areas more accurately. However, this method failed to predict some oil fields and wrongly predict some areas as potential zones."}
{"text": "The Kalman filter (KF) is used in a variety of applications for computing the posterior distribution of latent states in a state space model. The model requires a linear relationship between states and observations. Extensions to the Kalman filter have been proposed that incorporate linear approximations to nonlinear models, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). However, we argue that in cases where the dimensionality of observed variables greatly exceeds the dimensionality of state variables, a model for $p(\\text{state}|\\text{observation})$ proves both easier to learn and more accurate for latent space estimation. We derive and validate what we call the discriminative Kalman filter (DKF): a closed-form discriminative version of Bayesian filtering that readily incorporates off-the-shelf discriminative learning techniques. Further, we demonstrate that given mild assumptions, highly non-linear models for $p(\\text{state}|\\text{observation})$ can be specified. We motivate and validate on synthetic datasets and in neural decoding from non-human primates, showing substantial increases in decoding performance versus the standard Kalman filter."}

{"text": "We improve current instability-based methods for the selection of the number of clusters $k$ in cluster analysis by developing a normalized cluster instability measure that corrects for the distribution of cluster sizes, a previously unaccounted driver of cluster instability. We show that our normalized instability measure outperforms current instability-based measures across the whole sequence of possible $k$ and especially overcomes limitations in the context of large $k$. We also compare, for the first time, model-based and model-free approaches to determine cluster-instability and find their performance to be comparable. We make our method available in the R-package \\verb+cstab+."}
{"text": "The unscented transformation (UT) is an efficient method to solve the state estimation problem for a non-linear dynamic system, utilizing a derivative-free higher-order approximation by approximating a Gaussian distribution rather than approximating a non-linear function. Applying the UT to a Kalman filter type estimator leads to the well-known unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Although the UKF works very well in Gaussian noises, its performance may deteriorate significantly when the noises are non-Gaussian, especially when the system is disturbed by some heavy-tailed impulsive noises. To improve the robustness of the UKF against impulsive noises, a new filter for nonlinear systems is proposed in this work, namely the maximum correntropy unscented filter (MCUF). In MCUF, the UT is applied to obtain the prior estimates of the state and covariance matrix, and a robust statistical linearization regression based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is then used to obtain the posterior estimates of the state and covariance. The satisfying performance of the new algorithm is confirmed by two illustrative examples."}
{"text": "Kernel-based K-means clustering has gained popularity due to its simplicity and the power of its implicit non-linear representation of the data. A dominant concern is the memory requirement since memory scales as the square of the number of data points. We provide a new analysis of a class of approximate kernel methods that have more modest memory requirements, and propose a specific one-pass randomized kernel approximation followed by standard K-means on the transformed data. The analysis and experiments suggest the method is accurate, while requiring drastically less memory than standard kernel K-means and significantly less memory than Nystrom based approximations."}
{"text": "Manifold Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been introduced to sample more effectively from challenging target densities exhibiting multiple modes or strong correlations. Such algorithms exploit the local geometry of the parameter space, thus enabling chains to achieve a faster convergence rate when measured in number of steps. However, acquiring local geometric information can often increase computational complexity per step to the extent that sampling from high-dimensional targets becomes inefficient in terms of total computational time. This paper analyzes the computational complexity of manifold Langevin Monte Carlo and proposes a geometric adaptive Monte Carlo sampler aimed at balancing the benefits of exploiting local geometry with computational cost to achieve a high effective sample size for a given computational cost. The suggested sampler is a discrete-time stochastic process in random environment. The random environment allows to switch between local geometric and adaptive proposal kernels with the help of a schedule. An exponential schedule is put forward that enables more frequent use of geometric information in early transient phases of the chain, while saving computational time in late stationary phases. The average complexity can be manually set depending on the need for geometric exploitation posed by the underlying model."}
{"text": "An incremental/online state dynamic learning method is proposed for identification of the nonlinear Gaussian state space models. The method embeds the stochastic variational sparse Gaussian process as the probabilistic state dynamic model inside a particle filter framework. Model updating is done at measurement sample rate using stochastic gradient descent based optimization implemented in the state estimation filtering loop. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian process based batch learning methods. Finally, it is shown that the state estimation performance significantly improves due to the online learning of state dynamics."}
{"text": "Gaussian graphical models are widely used to represent conditional dependence among random variables. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for data arising from a group of Gaussian graphical models that are themselves dependent. A motivating example is that of modeling gene expression collected on multiple tissues from the same individual: here the multivariate outcome is affected by dependencies acting not only at the level of the specific tissues, but also at the level of the whole body; existing methods that assume independence among graphs are not applicable in this case. To estimate multiple dependent graphs, we decompose the problem into two graphical layers: the systemic layer, which affects all outcomes and thereby induces cross- graph dependence, and the category-specific layer, which represents graph-specific variation. We propose a graphical EM technique that estimates both layers jointly, establish estimation consistency and selection sparsistency of the proposed estimator, and confirm by simulation that the EM method is superior to a simple one-step method. We apply our technique to mouse genomics data and obtain biologically plausible results."}
{"text": "Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, that are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). However, these methods don't exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks was proposed in \\cite{Gregor10}, coined LISTA, which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately.   In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails."}
{"text": "We develop an automated variational method for inference in models with Gaussian process (GP) priors and general likelihoods. The method supports multiple outputs and multiple latent functions and does not require detailed knowledge of the conditional likelihood, only needing its evaluation as a black-box function. Using a mixture of Gaussians as the variational distribution, we show that the evidence lower bound and its gradients can be estimated efficiently using samples from univariate Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, the method is scalable to large datasets which is achieved by using an augmented prior via the inducing-variable approach underpinning most sparse GP approximations, along with parallel computation and stochastic optimization. We evaluate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively with experiments on small datasets, medium-scale datasets and large datasets, showing its competitiveness under different likelihood models and sparsity levels. On the large-scale experiments involving prediction of airline delays and classification of handwritten digits, we show that our method is on par with the state-of-the-art hard-coded approaches for scalable GP regression and classification."}
{"text": "This work presents PESMOC, Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Constraints, an information-based strategy for the simultaneous optimization of multiple expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions under the presence of several constraints. PESMOC can hence be used to solve a wide range of optimization problems. Iteratively, PESMOC chooses an input location on which to evaluate the objective functions and the constraints so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the Pareto set of the corresponding optimization problem. The constraints considered in PESMOC are assumed to have similar properties to those of the objective functions in typical Bayesian optimization problems. That is, they do not have a known expression (which prevents gradient computation), their evaluation is considered to be very expensive, and the resulting observations may be corrupted by noise. These constraints arise in a plethora of expensive black-box optimization problems. We carry out synthetic experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of PESMOC, where we sample both the objectives and the constraints from a Gaussian process prior. The results obtained show that PESMOC is able to provide better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations than a strategy based on random search."}
{"text": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, the interpretability of PCA remains limited. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as Sparse PCA, have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images accounting for most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining l1 and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes higher order information about the structure of the data. This paper presents the structured sparse PCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of SPCA-TV on three different data sets. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches are significant,since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easy to interpret, and are more stable across different samples."}
{"text": "We develop an automated variational inference method for Bayesian structured prediction problems with Gaussian process (GP) priors and linear-chain likelihoods. Our approach does not need to know the details of the structured likelihood model and can scale up to a large number of observations. Furthermore, we show that the required expected likelihood term and its gradients in the variational objective (ELBO) can be estimated efficiently by using expectations over very low-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Optimization of the ELBO is fully parallelizable over sequences and amenable to stochastic optimization, which we use along with control variate techniques and state-of-the-art incremental optimization to make our framework useful in practice. Results on a set of natural language processing tasks show that our method can be as good as (and sometimes better than) hard-coded approaches including SVM-struct and CRFs, and overcomes the scalability limitations of previous inference algorithms based on sampling. Overall, this is a fundamental step to developing automated inference methods for Bayesian structured prediction."}
{"text": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates proposals for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by simulating the dynamics of a Hamiltonian system. However, HMC is sensitive to large time discretizations and performs poorly if there is a mismatch between the spatial geometry of the target distribution and the scales of the momentum distribution. In particular the mass matrix of HMC is hard to tune well. In order to alleviate these problems we propose relativistic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a version of HMC based on relativistic dynamics that introduce a maximum velocity on particles. We also derive stochastic gradient versions of the algorithm and show that the resulting algorithms bear interesting relationships to gradient clipping, RMSprop, Adagrad and Adam, popular optimisation methods in deep learning. Based on this, we develop relativistic stochastic gradient descent by taking the zero-temperature limit of relativistic stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In experiments we show that the relativistic algorithms perform better than classical Newtonian variants and Adam."}
{"text": "Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) is an elegant approach for unsupervised segmentation if the data points of each cluster are located in linear subspaces. This model applies, for instance, in motion segmentation if some restrictions on the camera model hold. SSC requires that problems based on the $l_1$-norm are solved to infer which points belong to the same subspace. If these unknown subspaces are well-separated this algorithm is guaranteed to succeed. The algorithm rests upon the assumption that points on the same subspace are well spread. The question what happens if this condition is violated has not yet been investigated. In this work, the effect of particular distributions on the same subspace will be analyzed. It will be shown that SSC fails to infer correct labels if points on the same subspace fall into more than one cluster."}
{"text": "Understanding the relationships between different properties of data, such as whether a connectome or genome has information about disease status, is becoming increasingly important in modern biological datasets. While existing approaches can test whether two properties are related, they often require unfeasibly large sample sizes in real data scenarios, and do not provide any insight into how or why the procedure reached its decision. Our approach, \"Multiscale Graph Correlation\" (MGC), is a dependence test that juxtaposes previously disparate data science techniques, including k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods (such as support vector machines), and multiscale analysis (such as wavelets). Other methods typically require double or triple the number samples to achieve the same statistical power as MGC in a benchmark suite including high-dimensional and nonlinear relationships - spanning polynomial (linear, quadratic, cubic), trigonometric (sinusoidal, circular, ellipsoidal, spiral), geometric (square, diamond, W-shape), and other functions, with dimensionality ranging from 1 to 1000. Moreover, MGC uniquely provides a simple and elegant characterization of the potentially complex latent geometry underlying the relationship, providing insight while maintaining computational efficiency. In several real data applications, including brain imaging and cancer genetics, MGC is the only method that can both detect the presence of a dependency and provide specific guidance for the next experiment and/or analysis to conduct."}
{"text": "We extend the adaptive regression spline model by incorporating saturation, the natural requirement that a function extend as a constant outside a certain range. We fit saturating splines to data using a convex optimization problem over a space of measures, which we solve using an efficient algorithm based on the conditional gradient method. Unlike many existing approaches, our algorithm solves the original infinite-dimensional (for splines of degree at least two) optimization problem without pre-specified knot locations. We then adapt our algorithm to fit generalized additive models with saturating splines as coordinate functions and show that the saturation requirement allows our model to simultaneously perform feature selection and nonlinear function fitting. Finally, we briefly sketch how the method can be extended to higher order splines and to different requirements on the extension outside the data range."}
{"text": "In many applications (in particular information systems, such as pattern recognition, machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics to name but a few) the assessment of uncertainty is essential - i.e., the estimation of the underlying probability distribution function. More often than not, the form of this function is unknown and it becomes necessary to non-parametrically construct/estimate it from a given sample. One of the methods of choice to non-parametrically estimate the unknown probability distribution function for a given random variable (defined on binary space) has been the expansion of the estimation function in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions. In this paper we demonstrate that the expansion of the probability distribution function estimation in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions is equivalent to the expansion of the function estimation in a set of \"Dirac kernel\" functions. The latter approach can ameliorate the computational bottleneck and notational awkwardness often associated with the Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions approach, in particular when the binary input space is large."}
{"text": "The softmax representation of probabilities for categorical variables plays a prominent role in modern machine learning with numerous applications in areas such as large scale classification, neural language modeling and recommendation systems. However, softmax estimation is very expensive for large scale inference because of the high cost associated with computing the normalizing constant. Here, we introduce an efficient approximation to softmax probabilities which takes the form of a rigorous lower bound on the exact probability. This bound is expressed as a product over pairwise probabilities and it leads to scalable estimation based on stochastic optimization. It allows us to perform doubly stochastic estimation by subsampling both training instances and class labels. We show that the new bound has interesting theoretical properties and we demonstrate its use in classification problems."}
{"text": "Variational inference lies at the core of many state-of-the-art algorithms. To improve the approximation of the posterior beyond parametric families, it was proposed to include MCMC steps into the variational lower bound. In this work we explore this idea using steps of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, an efficient MCMC method. In particular, we incorporate the acceptance step of the HMC algorithm, guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the true posterior. Additionally, we introduce some extensions to the HMC algorithm geared towards faster convergence. The theoretical advantages of these modifications are reflected by performance improvements in our experimental results."}
{"text": "With the scale of data growing every day, reducing the dimensionality (a.k.a. sketching) of high-dimensional data has emerged as a task of paramount importance. Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume of data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format of acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these challenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning approach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical (bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit and Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process lying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies on low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized maximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via alternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical data `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new incomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight first-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an extra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly along with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models. Performance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite data streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary point set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear regret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes for real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification."}
{"text": "To date, the instability of prognostic predictors in a sparse high dimensional model, which hinders their clinical adoption, has received little attention. Stable prediction is often overlooked in favour of performance. Yet, stability prevails as key when adopting models in critical areas as healthcare. Our study proposes a stabilization scheme by detecting higher order feature correlations. Using a linear model as basis for prediction, we achieve feature stability by regularising latent correlation in features. Latent higher order correlation among features is modelled using an autoencoder network. Stability is enhanced by combining a recent technique that uses a feature graph, and augmenting external unlabelled data for training the autoencoder network. Our experiments are conducted on a heart failure cohort from an Australian hospital. Stability was measured using Consistency index for feature subsets and signal-to-noise ratio for model parameters. Our methods demonstrated significant improvement in feature stability and model estimation stability when compared to baselines."}
{"text": "Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical models that are useful for representing high-dimensional probability distributions. There has been a great deal of interest in recent years in the NP-hard problem of learning the structure of a BN from observed data. Typically, one assigns a score to various structures and the search becomes an optimization problem that can be approached with either deterministic or stochastic methods. In this paper, we walk through the space of graphs by modeling the appearance and disappearance of edges as a birth and death process and compare our novel approach to the popular Metropolis-Hastings search strategy. We give empirical evidence that the birth and death process has superior mixing properties."}
{"text": "Gaussian processes are powerful, yet analytically tractable models for supervised learning. A Gaussian process is characterized by a mean function and a covariance function (kernel), which are determined by a model selection criterion. The functions to be compared do not just differ in their parametrization but in their fundamental structure. It is often not clear which function structure to choose, for instance to decide between a squared exponential and a rational quadratic kernel. Based on the principle of approximation set coding, we develop a framework for model selection to rank kernels for Gaussian process regression. In our experiments approximation set coding shows promise to become a model selection criterion competitive with maximum evidence (also called marginal likelihood) and leave-one-out cross-validation."}
{"text": "Motivated by electricity consumption metering, we extend existing nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms to use linear measurements as observations, instead of matrix entries. The objective is to estimate multiple time series at a fine temporal scale from temporal aggregates measured on each individual series. Furthermore, our algorithm is extended to take into account individual autocorrelation to provide better estimation, using a recent convex relaxation of quadratically constrained quadratic program. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world electricity consumption datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our matrix recovery algorithms."}
{"text": "Constrained adaptive filtering algorithms inculding constrained least mean square (CLMS), constrained affine projection (CAP) and constrained recursive least squares (CRLS) have been extensively studied in many applications. Most existing constrained adaptive filtering algorithms are developed under mean square error (MSE) criterion, which is an ideal optimality criterion under Gaussian noises. This assumption however fails to model the behavior of non-Gaussian noises found in practice. Motivated by the robustness and simplicity of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) in non-Gaussian impulsive noises, this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering algorithm called constrained maximum correntropy criterion (CMCC). Specifically, CMCC incorporates a linear constraint into a MCC filter to solve a constrained optimization problem explicitly. The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm is easy to implement and has low computational complexity, and in terms of convergence accuracy (say lower mean square deviation) and stability, can significantly outperform those MSE based constrained adaptive algorithms in presence of heavy-tailed impulsive noises. Additionally, the mean square convergence behaviors are studied under energy conservation relation, and a sufficient condition to ensure the mean square convergence and the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) of the proposed algorithm are obtained. Simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions under both Gaussian and non- Gaussian noises, and demonstrate the excellent performance of the novel algorithm by comparing it with other conventional methods."}
{"text": "The reparameterization gradient has become a widely used method to obtain Monte Carlo gradients to optimize the variational objective. However, this technique does not easily apply to commonly used distributions such as beta or gamma without further approximations, and most practical applications of the reparameterization gradient fit Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we introduce the generalized reparameterization gradient, a method that extends the reparameterization gradient to a wider class of variational distributions. Generalized reparameterizations use invertible transformations of the latent variables which lead to transformed distributions that weakly depend on the variational parameters. This results in new Monte Carlo gradients that combine reparameterization gradients and score function gradients. We demonstrate our approach on variational inference for two complex probabilistic models. The generalized reparameterization is effective: even a single sample from the variational distribution is enough to obtain a low-variance gradient."}
{"text": "We propose a nonparametric sequential test that aims to address two practical problems pertinent to online randomized experiments: (i) how to do a hypothesis test for complex metrics; (ii) how to prevent type $1$ error inflation under continuous monitoring. The proposed test does not require knowledge of the underlying probability distribution generating the data. We use the bootstrap to estimate the likelihood for blocks of data followed by mixture sequential probability ratio test. We validate this procedure on data from a major online e-commerce website. We show that the proposed test controls type $1$ error at any time, has good power, is robust to misspecification in the distribution generating the data, and allows quick inference in online randomized experiments."}
{"text": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are successful deep generative models. GANs are based on a two-player minimax game. However, the objective function derived in the original motivation is changed to obtain stronger gradients when learning the generator. We propose a novel algorithm that repeats the density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. Our algorithm offers a new perspective toward the understanding of GANs and is able to make use of multiple viewpoints obtained in the research of density ratio estimation, e.g. what divergence is stable and relative density ratio is useful."}
{"text": "We derive a novel variational expectation maximization approach based on truncated posterior distributions. Truncated distributions are proportional to exact posteriors within subsets of a discrete state space and equal zero otherwise. The treatment of the distributions' subsets as variational parameters distinguishes the approach from previous variational approaches. The specific structure of truncated distributions allows for deriving novel and mathematically grounded results, which in turn can be used to formulate novel efficient algorithms to optimize the parameters of probabilistic generative models. Most centrally, we find the variational lower bounds that correspond to truncated distributions to be given by very concise and efficiently computable expressions, while update equations for model parameters remain in their standard form. Based on these findings, we show how efficient and easily applicable meta-algorithms can be formulated that guarantee a monotonic increase of the variational bound. Example applications of the here derived framework provide novel theoretical results and learning procedures for latent variable models as well as mixture models. Furthermore, we show that truncated variation EM naturally interpolates between standard EM with full posteriors and EM based on the maximum a-posteriori state (MAP). The approach can, therefore, be regarded as a generalization of the popular `hard EM' approach towards a similarly efficient method which can capture more of the true posterior structure."}

{"text": "We study statistical inference and distributionally robust solution methods for stochastic optimization problems, focusing on confidence intervals for optimal values and solutions that achieve exact coverage asymptotically. We develop a generalized empirical likelihood framework---based on distributional uncertainty sets constructed from nonparametric $f$-divergence balls---for Hadamard differentiable functionals, and in particular, stochastic optimization problems. As consequences of this theory, we provide a principled method for choosing the size of distributional uncertainty regions to provide one- and two-sided confidence intervals that achieve exact coverage. We also give an asymptotic expansion for our distributionally robust formulation, showing how robustification regularizes problems by their variance. Finally, we show that optimizers of the distributionally robust formulations we study enjoy (essentially) the same consistency properties as those in classical sample average approximations. Our general approach applies to quickly mixing stationary sequences, including geometrically ergodic Harris recurrent Markov chains."}
{"text": "Sources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument, and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq, are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data is not properly calibrated. We propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider clustering data that is assumed to come from one of finitely many pointed convex polyhedral cones. This model is referred to as the Union of Polyhedral Cones (UOPC) model. Similar to the Union of Subspaces (UOS) model where each data from each subspace is generated from a (unknown) basis, in the UOPC model each data from each cone is assumed to be generated from a finite number of (unknown) \\emph{extreme rays}.To cluster data under this model, we consider several algorithms - (a) Sparse Subspace Clustering by Non-negative constraints Lasso (NCL), (b) Least squares approximation (LSA), and (c) K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to arrive at affinity between data points. Spectral Clustering (SC) is then applied on the resulting affinity matrix to cluster data into different polyhedral cones. We show that on an average KNN outperforms both NCL and LSA and for this algorithm we provide the deterministic conditions for correct clustering. For an affinity measure between the cones it is shown that as long as the cones are not very coherent and as long as the density of data within each cone exceeds a threshold, KNN leads to accurate clustering. Finally, simulation results on real datasets (MNIST and YaleFace datasets) depict that the proposed algorithm works well on real data indicating the utility of the UOPC model and the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "We propose a communication-efficient distributed estimation method for sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the high dimensional regime. Our method distributes the data of size $N$ into $m$ machines, and estimates a local sparse LDA estimator on each machine using the data subset of size $N/m$. After the distributed estimation, our method aggregates the debiased local estimators from $m$ machines, and sparsifies the aggregated estimator. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimation method, as long as the number of machines $m$ is chosen appropriately. Moreover, we prove that our method can attain the model selection consistency under a milder condition than the centralized method. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "Density matrices are positively semi-definite Hermitian matrices with unit trace that describe the states of quantum systems. Many quantum systems of physical interest can be represented as high-dimensional low rank density matrices. A popular problem in {\\it quantum state tomography} (QST) is to estimate the unknown low rank density matrix of a quantum system by conducting Pauli measurements. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we establish the minimax lower bounds in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$ for low rank density matrices estimation by Pauli measurements. In our previous paper, these minimax lower bounds are proved under the trace regression model with Gaussian noise and the noise is assumed to have common variance. In this paper, we prove these bounds under the Binomial observation model which meets the actual model in QST.   Second, we study the Dantzig estimator (DE) for estimating the unknown low rank density matrix under the Binomial observation model by using Pauli measurements. In our previous papers, we studied the least squares estimator and the projection estimator, where we proved the optimal convergence rates for the least squares estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq 2$ and, under a stronger condition, the optimal convergence rates for the projection estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$. In this paper, we show that the results of these two distinct estimators can be simultaneously obtained by the Dantzig estimator. Moreover, better convergence rates in Schatten norm distances can be proved for Dantzig estimator under conditions weaker than those needed in previous papers. When the objective function of DE is replaced by the negative von Neumann entropy, we obtain sharp convergence rate in Kullback-Leibler divergence."}
{"text": "Quantitative modeling of post-transcriptional regulation process is a challenging problem in systems biology. A mechanical model of the regulatory process needs to be able to describe the available spatio-temporal protein concentration and mRNA expression data and recover the continuous spatio-temporal fields. Rigorous methods are required to identify model parameters. A promising approach to deal with these difficulties is proposed using Gaussian process as a prior distribution over the latent function of protein concentration and mRNA expression. In this study, we consider a partial differential equation mechanical model with differential operators and latent function. Since the operators at stake are linear, the information from the physical model can be encoded into the kernel function. Hybrid Monte Carlo methods are employed to carry out Bayesian inference of the partial differential equation parameters and Gaussian process kernel parameters. The spatio-temporal field of protein concentration and mRNA expression are reconstructed without explicitly solving the partial differential equation."}
{"text": "Importance sampling is widely used in machine learning and statistics, but its power is limited by the restriction of using simple proposals for which the importance weights can be tractably calculated. We address this problem by studying black-box importance sampling methods that calculate importance weights for samples generated from any unknown proposal or black-box mechanism. Our method allows us to use better and richer proposals to solve difficult problems, and (somewhat counter-intuitively) also has the additional benefit of improving the estimation accuracy beyond typical importance sampling. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are provided."}
{"text": "We propose a unified framework for estimating low-rank matrices through nonconvex optimization based on gradient descent algorithm. Our framework is quite general and can be applied to both noisy and noiseless observations. In the general case with noisy observations, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix up to minimax optimal statistical error, provided an appropriate initial estimator. While in the generic noiseless setting, our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate and enables exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. In addition, we develop a new initialization algorithm to provide a desired initial estimator, which outperforms existing initialization algorithms for nonconvex low-rank matrix estimation. We illustrate the superiority of our framework through three examples: matrix regression, matrix completion, and one-bit matrix completion. We also corroborate our theory through extensive experiments on synthetic data."}
{"text": "We investigate the capabilities and limitations of Gaussian process models by jointly exploring three complementary directions: (i) scalable and statistically efficient inference; (ii) flexible kernels; and (iii) objective functions for hyperparameter learning alternative to the marginal likelihood. Our approach outperforms all previously reported GP methods on the standard MNIST dataset; performs comparatively to previous kernel-based methods using the RECTANGLES-IMAGE dataset; and breaks the 1% error-rate barrier in GP models using the MNIST8M dataset, showing along the way the scalability of our method at unprecedented scale for GP models (8 million observations) in classification problems. Overall, our approach represents a significant breakthrough in kernel methods and GP models, bridging the gap between deep learning approaches and kernel machines."}
{"text": "We provide a theoretical foundation for non-parametric estimation of functions of random variables using kernel mean embeddings. We show that for any continuous function $f$, consistent estimators of the mean embedding of a random variable $X$ lead to consistent estimators of the mean embedding of $f(X)$. For Mat\\'ern kernels and sufficiently smooth functions we also provide rates of convergence. Our results extend to functions of multiple random variables. If the variables are dependent, we require an estimator of the mean embedding of their joint distribution as a starting point; if they are independent, it is sufficient to have separate estimators of the mean embeddings of their marginal distributions. In either case, our results cover both mean embeddings based on i.i.d. samples as well as \"reduced set\" expansions in terms of dependent expansion points. The latter serves as a justification for using such expansions to limit memory resources when applying the approach as a basis for probabilistic programming."}
{"text": "The determination of cluster centers generally depends on the scale that we use to analyze the data to be clustered. Inappropriate scale usually leads to unreasonable cluster centers and thus unreasonable results. In this study, we first consider the similarity of elements in the data as the connectivity of nodes in an undirected graph, then present the concept of a connection center and regard it as the cluster center of the data. Based on this definition, the determination of cluster centers and the assignment of class are very simple, natural and effective. One more crucial finding is that the cluster centers of different scales can be obtained easily by the different powers of a similarity matrix and the change of power from small to large leads to the dynamic evolution of cluster centers from local (microscopic) to global (microscopic). Further, in this process of evolution, the number of categories changes discontinuously, which means that the presented method can automatically skip the unreasonable number of clusters, suggest appropriate observation scales and provide corresponding cluster results."}
{"text": "Effective and accurate model selection is an important problem in modern data analysis. One of the major challenges is the computational burden required to handle large data sets that cannot be stored or processed on one machine. Another challenge one may encounter is the presence of outliers and contaminations that damage the inference quality. The parallel \"divide and conquer\" model selection strategy divides the observations of the full data set into roughly equal subsets and perform inference and model selection independently on each subset. After local subset inference, this method aggregates the posterior model probabilities or other model/variable selection criteria to obtain a final model by using the notion of geometric median. This approach leads to improved concentration in finding the \"correct\" model and model parameters and also is provably robust to outliers and data contamination."}
{"text": "Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful method for blind source separation based on the assumption that sources are statistically independent. Though ICA has proven useful and has been employed in many applications, complete statistical independence can be too restrictive an assumption in practice. Additionally, important prior information about the data, such as sparsity, is usually available. Sparsity is a natural property of the data, a form of diversity, which, if incorporated into the ICA model, can relax the independence assumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance. In this work, we propose a new variant of ICA by entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM)-a flexible, yet parameter-free algorithm-through the direct exploitation of sparsity. Using this new SparseICA-EBM algorithm, we study the synergy of independence and sparsity through simulations on synthetic as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-like data."}
{"text": "The goal of two-sample tests is to assess whether two samples, $S_P \\sim P^n$ and $S_Q \\sim Q^m$, are drawn from the same distribution. Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis \"$P = Q$\" is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level. As we will show, such Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ. The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST. First, we analyze their main theoretical properties. Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives. Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery."}
{"text": "Recent advances in Bayesian learning with large-scale data have witnessed emergence of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC), such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian MCMC (SGHMC), and the stochastic gradient thermostat. While finite-time convergence properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In this paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and develop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their asymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric splitting integrator, the {\\em mean square error} (MSE) of the posterior average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$ iterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs are also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method in two large-scale real applications."}
{"text": "We present a sparse estimation and dictionary learning framework for compressed fiber sensing based on a probabilistic hierarchical sparse model. To handle severe dictionary coherence, selective shrinkage is achieved using a Weibull prior, which can be related to non-convex optimization with $p$-norm constraints for $0 < p < 1$. In addition, we leverage the specific dictionary structure to promote collective shrinkage based on a local similarity model. This is incorporated in form of a kernel function in the joint prior density of the sparse coefficients, thereby establishing a Markov random field-relation. Approximate inference is accomplished using a hybrid technique that combines Hamilton Monte Carlo and Gibbs sampling. To estimate the dictionary parameter, we pursue two strategies, relying on either a deterministic or a probabilistic model for the dictionary parameter. In the first strategy, the parameter is estimated based on alternating estimation. In the second strategy, it is jointly estimated along with the sparse coefficients. The performance is evaluated in comparison to an existing method in various scenarios using simulations and experimental data."}
{"text": "Gradient matching with Gaussian processes is a promising tool for learning parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODE's). The essence of gradient matching is to model the prior over state variables as a Gaussian process which implies that the joint distribution given the ODE's and GP kernels is also Gaussian distributed. The state-derivatives are integrated out analytically since they are modelled as latent variables. However, the state variables themselves are also latent variables because they are contaminated by noise. Previous work sampled the state variables since integrating them out is \\textit{not} analytically tractable. In this paper we use mean-field approximation to establish tight variational lower bounds that decouple state variables and are therefore, in contrast to the integral over state variables, analytically tractable and even concave for a restricted family of ODE's, including nonlinear and periodic ODE's. Such variational lower bounds facilitate \"hill climbing\" to determine the maximum a posteriori estimate of ODE parameters. An additional advantage of our approach over sampling methods is the determination of a proxy to the intractable posterior distribution over state variables given observations and the ODE's."}
{"text": "Independent component analysis (ICA) is the most popular method for blind source separation (BSS) with a diverse set of applications, such as biomedical signal processing, video and image analysis, and communications. Maximum likelihood (ML), an optimal theoretical framework for ICA, requires knowledge of the true underlying probability density function (PDF) of the latent sources, which, in many applications, is unknown. ICA algorithms cast in the ML framework often deviate from its theoretical optimality properties due to poor estimation of the source PDF. Therefore, accurate estimation of source PDFs is critical in order to avoid model mismatch and poor ICA performance. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient ICA algorithm based on entropy maximization with kernels, (ICA-EMK), which uses both global and local measuring functions as constraints to dynamically estimate the PDF of the sources with reasonable complexity. In addition, the new algorithm performs optimization with respect to each of the cost function gradient directions separately, enabling parallel implementations on multi-core computers. We demonstrate the superior performance of ICA-EMK over competing ICA algorithms using simulated as well as real-world data."}
{"text": "In this paper, we develop a new sequential regression modeling approach for data streams. Data streams are commonly found around us, e.g in a retail enterprise sales data is continuously collected every day. A demand forecasting model is an important outcome from the data that needs to be continuously updated with the new incoming data. The main challenge in such modeling arises when there is a) high dimensional and sparsity, b) need for an adaptive use of prior knowledge, and/or c) structural changes in the system. The proposed approach addresses these challenges by incorporating an adaptive L1-penalty and inertia terms in the loss function, and thus called Inertial Regularization and Selection (IRS). The former term performs model selection to handle the first challenge while the latter is shown to address the last two challenges. A recursive estimation algorithm is developed, and shown to outperform the commonly used state-space models, such as Kalman Filters, in experimental studies and real data."}
{"text": "Datasets containing large samples of time-to-event data arising from several small heterogeneous groups are commonly encountered in statistics. This presents problems as they cannot be pooled directly due to their heterogeneity or analyzed individually because of their small sample size. Bayesian nonparametric modelling approaches can be used to model such datasets given their ability to flexibly share information across groups. In this paper, we will compare three popular Bayesian nonparametric methods for modelling the survival functions of heterogeneous groups. Specifically, we will first compare the modelling accuracy of the Dirichlet process, the hierarchical Dirichlet process, and the nested Dirichlet process on simulated datasets of different sizes, where group survival curves differ in shape or in expectation. We, then, will compare the models on a real-world injury dataset."}
{"text": "We introduce a mixture model for censored durations (C-mix), and develop maximum likelihood inference for the joint estimation of the time distributions and latent regression parameters of the model. We consider a high-dimensional setting, with datasets containing a large number of biomedical covariates. We therefore penalize the negative log-likelihood by the Elastic-Net, which leads to a sparse parameterization of the model. Inference is achieved using an efficient Quasi-Newton Expectation Maximization (QNEM) algorithm, for which we provide convergence properties. We then propose a score by assessing the patients risk of early adverse event. The statistical performance of the method is examined on an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, and finally illustrated on three genetic datasets with high-dimensional covariates. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, namely both the CURE and Cox proportional hazards models for this task, both in terms of C-index and AUC(t)."}
{"text": "We propose a parallelizable sparse inverse formulation Gaussian process (SpInGP) for temporal models. It uses a sparse precision GP formulation and sparse matrix routines to speed up the computations. Due to the state-space formulation used in the algorithm, the time complexity of the basic SpInGP is linear, and because all the computations are parallelizable, the parallel form of the algorithm is sublinear in the number of data points. We provide example algorithms to implement the sparse matrix routines and experimentally test the method using both simulated and real data."}
{"text": "In this paper we investigate a link between state- space models and Gaussian Processes (GP) for time series modeling and forecasting. In particular, several widely used state- space models are transformed into continuous time form and corresponding Gaussian Process kernels are derived. Experimen- tal results demonstrate that the derived GP kernels are correct and appropriate for Gaussian Process Regression. An experiment with a real world dataset shows that the modeling is identical with state-space models and with the proposed GP kernels. The considered connection allows the researchers to look at their models from a different angle and facilitate sharing ideas between these two different modeling approaches."}
{"text": "Directed networks are pervasive both in nature and engineered systems, often underlying the complex behavior observed in biological systems, microblogs and social interactions over the web, as well as global financial markets. Since their structures are often unobservable, in order to facilitate network analytics, one generally resorts to approaches capitalizing on measurable nodal processes to infer the unknown topology. Structural equation models (SEMs) are capable of incorporating exogenous inputs to resolve inherent directional ambiguities. However, conventional SEMs assume full knowledge of exogenous inputs, which may not be readily available in some practical settings. The present paper advocates a novel SEM-based topology inference approach that entails factorization of a three-way tensor, constructed from the observed nodal data, using the well-known parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. It turns out that second-order piecewise stationary statistics of exogenous variables suffice to identify the hidden topology. Capitalizing on the uniqueness properties inherent to high-order tensor factorizations, it is shown that topology identification is possible under reasonably mild conditions. In addition, to facilitate real-time operation and inference of time-varying networks, an adaptive (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition scheme which tracks the topology-revealing tensor factors is developed. Extensive tests on simulated and real stock quote data demonstrate the merits of the novel tensor-based approach."}
{"text": "Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These \"recurrent\" switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable."}
{"text": "Despite the fundamental nature of the inhomogeneous Poisson process in the theory and application of stochastic processes, and its attractive generalizations (e.g. Cox process), few tractable nonparametric modeling approaches of intensity functions exist, especially when observed points lie in a high-dimensional space. In this paper we develop a new, computationally tractable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) formulation for the inhomogeneous Poisson process. We model the square root of the intensity as an RKHS function. Whereas RKHS models used in supervised learning rely on the so-called representer theorem, the form of the inhomogeneous Poisson process likelihood means that the representer theorem does not apply. However, we prove that the representer theorem does hold in an appropriately transformed RKHS, guaranteeing that the optimization of the penalized likelihood can be cast as a tractable finite-dimensional problem. The resulting approach is simple to implement, and readily scales to high dimensions and large-scale datasets."}
{"text": "The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been widely used in statistical estimation for large-scale data due to its computational and memory efficiency. While most existing works focus on the convergence of the objective function or the error of the obtained solution, we investigate the problem of statistical inference of true model parameters based on SGD when the population loss function is strongly convex and satisfies certain smoothness conditions. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, in the fixed dimension setup, we propose two consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariance of the average iterate from SGD: (1) a plug-in estimator, and (2) a batch-means estimator, which is computationally more efficient and only uses the iterates from SGD. Both proposed estimators allow us to construct asymptotically exact confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Second, for high-dimensional linear regression, using a variant of the SGD algorithm, we construct a debiased estimator of each regression coefficient that is asymptotically normal. This gives a one-pass algorithm for computing both the sparse regression coefficients and confidence intervals, which is computationally attractive and applicable to online data."}
{"text": "GPflow is a Gaussian process library that uses TensorFlow for its core computations and Python for its front end. The distinguishing features of GPflow are that it uses variational inference as the primary approximation method, provides concise code through the use of automatic differentiation, has been engineered with a particular emphasis on software testing and is able to exploit GPU hardware."}
{"text": "This paper proposes a subspace decomposition method based on an over-complete dictionary in sparse representation, called \"Sparse Signal Subspace Decomposition\" (or 3SD) method. This method makes use of a novel criterion based on the occurrence frequency of atoms of the dictionary over the data set. This criterion, well adapted to subspace-decomposition over a dependent basis set, adequately re ects the intrinsic characteristic of regularity of the signal. The 3SD method combines variance, sparsity and component frequency criteria into an unified framework. It takes benefits from using an over-complete dictionary which preserves details and from subspace decomposition which rejects strong noise. The 3SD method is very simple with a linear retrieval operation. It does not require any prior knowledge on distributions or parameters. When applied to image denoising, it demonstrates high performances both at preserving fine details and suppressing strong noise."}
{"text": "Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a popular tool for data exploration. Bayesian NMF promises to also characterize uncertainty in the factorization. Unfortunately, current inference approaches such as MCMC mix slowly and tend to get stuck on single modes. We introduce a novel approach using rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) to asymptotically cover regions of high posterior density. These are placed in a principled Bayesian framework via an online extension to nonparametric variational inference. On experiments on real and synthetic data, we obtain greater coverage of the posterior and higher ELBO values than standard NMF inference approaches."}
{"text": "We propose a geometric algorithm for topic learning and inference that is built on the convex geometry of topics arising from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and its nonparametric extensions. To this end we study the optimization of a geometric loss function, which is a surrogate to the LDA's likelihood. Our method involves a fast optimization based weighted clustering procedure augmented with geometric corrections, which overcomes the computational and statistical inefficiencies encountered by other techniques based on Gibbs sampling and variational inference, while achieving the accuracy comparable to that of a Gibbs sampler. The topic estimates produced by our method are shown to be statistically consistent under some conditions. The algorithm is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "Regularised canonical correlation analysis was recently extended to more than two sets of variables by the multiblock method Regularised generalised canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA). Further, Sparse GCCA (SGCCA) was proposed to address the issue of variable selection. However, for technical reasons, the variable selection offered by SGCCA was restricted to a covariance link between the blocks (i.e., with $\\tau=1$). One of the main contributions of this paper is to go beyond the covariance link and to propose an extension of SGCCA for the full RGCCA model (i.e., with $\\tau\\in[0, 1]$). In addition, we propose an extension of SGCCA that exploits structural relationships between variables within blocks. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that allows structured and sparsity-inducing penalties to be included in the RGCCA optimisation problem. The proposed multiblock method is illustrated on a real three-block high-grade glioma data set, where the aim is to predict the location of the brain tumours, and on a simulated data set, where the aim is to illustrate the method's ability to reconstruct the true underlying weight vectors."}
{"text": "Exploiting the fact that most arrival processes exhibit cyclic behaviour, we propose a simple procedure for estimating the intensity of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The estimator is the super-resolution analogue to Shao 2010 and Shao & Lii 2011, which is a sum of $p$ sinusoids where $p$ and the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each wave are not known and need to be estimated. This results in an interpretable yet flexible specification that is suitable for use in modelling as well as in high resolution simulations.   Our estimation procedure sits in between classic periodogram methods and atomic/total variation norm thresholding. Through a novel use of window functions in the point process domain, our approach attains super-resolution without semidefinite programming. Under suitable conditions, finite sample guarantees can be derived for our procedure. These resolve some open questions and expand existing results in spectral estimation literature."}
{"text": "We propose a methodology to explore and measure the pairwise correlations that exist between variables in a dataset. The methodology leverages copulas for encoding dependence between two variables, state-of-the-art optimal transport for providing a relevant geometry to the copulas, and clustering for summarizing the main dependence patterns found between the variables. Some of the clusters centers can be used to parameterize a novel dependence coefficient which can target or forget specific dependence patterns. Finally, we illustrate and benchmark the methodology on several datasets. Code and numerical experiments are available online for reproducible research."}
{"text": "The analysis of nonstationary time series is of great importance in many scientific fields such as physics and neuroscience. In recent years, Gaussian process regression has attracted substantial attention as a robust and powerful method for analyzing time series. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing nonstationary time series using locally stationary Gaussian process analysis with parameters that are coupled through a hidden Markov model. The main advantage of this framework is that arbitrary complex nonstationary covariance functions can be obtained by combining simpler stationary building blocks whose hidden parameters can be estimated in closed-form. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by analyzing two examples of synthetic nonstationary signals: oscillations with time varying frequency and time series with two dynamical states. Finally, we report an example application on real magnetoencephalographic measurements of brain activity."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of constructing diffusion operators high dimensional data $X$ to address counterfactual functions $F$, such as individualized treatment effectiveness. We propose and construct a new diffusion metric $K_F$ that captures both the local geometry of $X$ and the directions of variance of $F$. The resulting diffusion metric is then used to define a localized filtration of $F$ and answer counterfactual questions pointwise, particularly in situations such as drug trials where an individual patient's outcomes cannot be studied long term both taking and not taking a medication. We validate the model on synthetic and real world clinical trials, and create individualized notions of benefit from treatment."}
{"text": "We propose a new method of discovering causal relationships in temporal data based on the notion of causal compression. To this end, we adopt the Pearlian graph setting and the directed information as an information theoretic tool for quantifying causality. We introduce chain rule for directed information and use it to motivate causal sparsity. We show two applications of the proposed method: causal time series segmentation which selects time points capturing the incoming and outgoing causal flow between time points belonging to different signals, and causal bipartite graph recovery. We prove that modelling of causality in the adopted set-up only requires estimating the copula density of the data distribution and thus does not depend on its marginals. We evaluate the method on time resolved gene expression data."}
{"text": "Kernel dependence measures yield accurate estimates of nonlinear relations between random variables, and they are also endorsed with solid theoretical properties and convergence rates. Besides, the empirical estimates are easy to compute in closed form just involving linear algebra operations. However, they are hampered by two important problems: the high computational cost involved, as two kernel matrices of the sample size have to be computed and stored, and the interpretability of the measure, which remains hidden behind the implicit feature map. We here address these two issues. We introduce the Sensitivity Maps (SMs) for the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Sensitivity maps allow us to explicitly analyze and visualize the relative relevance of both examples and features on the dependence measure. We also present the randomized HSIC (RHSIC) and its corresponding sensitivity maps to cope with large scale problems. We build upon the framework of random features and the Bochner's theorem to approximate the involved kernels in the canonical HSIC. The power of the RHSIC measure scales favourably with the number of samples, and it approximates HSIC and the sensitivity maps efficiently. Convergence bounds of both the measure and the sensitivity map are also provided. Our proposal is illustrated in synthetic examples, and challenging real problems of dependence estimation, feature selection, and causal inference from empirical data."}
{"text": "Semi-supervised and unsupervised systems provide operators with invaluable support and can tremendously reduce the operators load. In the light of the necessity to process large volumes of video data and provide autonomous decisions, this work proposes new learning algorithms for activity analysis in video. The activities and behaviours are described by a dynamic topic model. Two novel learning algorithms based on the expectation maximisation approach and variational Bayes inference are proposed. Theoretical derivations of the posterior of model parameters are given. The designed learning algorithms are compared with the Gibbs sampling inference scheme introduced earlier in the literature. A detailed comparison of the learning algorithms is presented on real video data. We also propose an anomaly localisation procedure, elegantly embedded in the topic modeling framework. The proposed framework can be applied to a number of areas, including transportation systems, security and surveillance."}
{"text": "Many machine learning algorithms require precise estimates of covariance matrices. The sample covariance matrix performs poorly in high-dimensional settings, which has stimulated the development of alternative methods, the majority based on factor models and shrinkage. Recent work of Ledoit and Wolf has extended the shrinkage framework to Nonlinear Shrinkage (NLS), a more powerful covariance estimator based on Random Matrix Theory.   Our contribution shows that, contrary to claims in the literature, cross-validation based covariance matrix estimation (CVC) yields comparable performance at strongly reduced complexity and runtime. On two real world data sets, we show that the CVC estimator yields superior results than competing shrinkage and factor based methods."}
{"text": "We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian model for survival analysis. The model is centred on a parametric baseline hazard, and uses a Gaussian process to model variations away from it nonparametrically, as well as dependence on covariates. As opposed to many other methods in survival analysis, our framework does not impose unnecessary constraints in the hazard rate or in the survival function. Furthermore, our model handles left, right and interval censoring mechanisms common in survival analysis. We propose a MCMC algorithm to perform inference and an approximation scheme based on random Fourier features to make computations faster. We report experimental results on synthetic and real data, showing that our model performs better than competing models such as Cox proportional hazards, ANOVA-DDP and random survival forests."}
{"text": "Tensor decomposition is an important technique for capturing the high-order interactions among multiway data. Multi-linear tensor composition methods, such as the Tucker decomposition and the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), assume that the complex interactions among objects are multi-linear, and are thus insufficient to represent nonlinear relationships in data. Another assumption of these methods is that a predefined rank should be known. However, the rank of tensors is hard to estimate, especially for cases with missing values. To address these issues, we design a Bayesian generative model for tensor decomposition. Different from the traditional Bayesian methods, the high-order interactions of tensor entries are modeled with variational auto-encoder. The proposed model takes advantages of Neural Networks and nonparametric Bayesian models, by replacing the multi-linear product in traditional Bayesian tensor decomposition with a complex nonlinear function (via Neural Networks) whose parameters can be learned from data. Experimental results on synthetic data and real-world chemometrics tensor data have demonstrated that our new model can achieve significantly higher prediction performance than the state-of-the-art tensor decomposition approaches."}
{"text": "In this article, we study spectral methods for community detection based on $ \\alpha$-parametrized normalized modularity matrix hereafter called $ {\\bf L}_\\alpha $ in heterogeneous graph models. We show, in a regime where community detection is not asymptotically trivial, that $ {\\bf L}_\\alpha $ can be well approximated by a more tractable random matrix which falls in the family of spiked random matrices. The analysis of this equivalent spiked random matrix allows us to improve spectral methods for community detection and assess their performances in the regime under study. In particular, we prove the existence of an optimal value $ \\alpha_{\\rm opt} $ of the parameter $ \\alpha $ for which the detection of communities is best ensured and we provide an on-line estimation of $ \\alpha_{\\rm opt} $ only based on the knowledge of the graph adjacency matrix. Unlike classical spectral methods for community detection where clustering is performed on the eigenvectors associated with extreme eigenvalues, we show through our theoretical analysis that a regularization should instead be performed on those eigenvectors prior to clustering in heterogeneous graphs. Finally, through a deeper study of the regularized eigenvectors used for clustering, we assess the performances of our new algorithm for community detection. Numerical simulations in the course of the article show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art spectral methods on dense heterogeneous graphs."}

We discuss the upper convergence rates of Tikhonov regularizer under general source condition corresponding to increasing monotone index function. The convergence issues are studied for general regularization schemes by using the concept of operator monotone index functions in minimax setting. Further we also address the minimum possible error for any learning algorithm."}
{"text": "Game theory finds nowadays a broad range of applications in engineering and machine learning. However, in a derivative-free, expensive black-box context, very few algorithmic solutions are available to find game equilibria. Here, we propose a novel Gaussian-process based approach for solving games in this context. We follow a classical Bayesian optimization framework, with sequential sampling decisions based on acquisition functions. Two strategies are proposed, based either on the probability of achieving equilibrium or on the Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction paradigm. Practical and numerical aspects are discussed in order to enhance the scalability and reduce computation time. Our approach is evaluated on several synthetic game problems with varying number of players and decision space dimensions. We show that equilibria can be found reliably for a fraction of the cost (in terms of black-box evaluations) compared to classical, derivative-based algorithms. The method is available in the R package GPGame available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=GPGame."}
{"text": "The vision for precision medicine is to use individual patient characteristics to inform a personalized treatment plan that leads to the best healthcare possible for each patient. Mobile technologies have an important role to play in this vision as they offer a means to monitor a patient's health status in real-time and subsequently to deliver interventions if, when, and in the dose that they are needed. Dynamic treatment regimes formalize individualized treatment plans as sequences of decision rules, one per stage of clinical intervention, that map current patient information to a recommended treatment. However, existing methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes are designed for a small number of fixed decision points occurring on a coarse time-scale. We propose a new reinforcement learning method for estimating an optimal treatment regime that is applicable to data collected using mobile technologies in an outpatient setting. The proposed method accommodates an indefinite time horizon and minute-by-minute decision making that are common in mobile health applications. We show the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. The proposed methods are applied to estimate an optimal dynamic treatment regime for controlling blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes."}
{"text": "We investigate if kernel regularization methods can achieve minimax convergence rates over a source condition regularity assumption for the target function. These questions have been considered in past literature, but only under specific assumptions about the decay, typically polynomial, of the spectrum of the the kernel mapping covariance operator. In the perspective of distribution-free results, we investigate this issue under much weaker assumption on the eigenvalue decay, allowing for more complex behavior that can reflect different structure of the data at different scales."}
{"text": "Spectral dimensionality reduction is frequently used to identify low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data. However, learning manifolds, especially from the streaming data, is computationally and memory expensive. In this paper, we argue that a stable manifold can be learned using only a fraction of the stream, and the remaining stream can be mapped to the manifold in a significantly less costly manner. Identifying the transition point at which the manifold is stable is the key step. We present error metrics that allow us to identify the transition point for a given stream by quantitatively assessing the quality of a manifold learned using Isomap. We further propose an efficient mapping algorithm, called S-Isomap, that can be used to map new samples onto the stable manifold. We describe experiments on a variety of data sets that show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy."}
{"text": "It has been proposed that complex populations, such as those that arise in genomics studies, may exhibit dependencies among observations as well as among variables. This gives rise to the challenging problem of analyzing unreplicated high-dimensional data with unknown mean and dependence structures. Matrix-variate approaches that impose various forms of (inverse) covariance sparsity allow flexible dependence structures to be estimated, but cannot directly be applied when the mean and covariance matrices are estimated jointly. We present a practical method utilizing generalized least squares and penalized (inverse) covariance estimation to address this challenge. We establish consistency and obtain rates of convergence for estimating the mean parameters and covariance matrices. The advantages of our approaches are: (i) dependence graphs and covariance structures can be estimated in the presence of unknown mean structure, (ii) the mean structure becomes more efficiently estimated when accounting for the dependence structure among observations; and (iii) inferences about the mean parameters become correctly calibrated. We use simulation studies and analysis of genomic data from a twin study of ulcerative colitis to illustrate the statistical convergence and the performance of our methods in practical settings. Several lines of evidence show that the test statistics for differential gene expression produced by our methods are correctly calibrated and improve power over conventional methods."}
{"text": "The ability to track a moving vehicle is of crucial importance in numerous applications. The task has often been approached by the importance sampling technique of particle filters due to its ability to model non-linear and non-Gaussian dynamics, of which a vehicle travelling on a road network is a good example. Particle filters perform poorly when observations are highly informative. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing particle filters that sample around the most recent observation. The proposal leads to an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy and efficiency over conventional particle filters, especially when observations are infrequent but low-noise."}
{"text": "In this paper we combine two important extensions of ordinary least squares regression: regularization and optimal scaling. Optimal scaling (sometimes also called optimal scoring) has originally been developed for categorical data, and the process finds quantifications for the categories that are optimal for the regression model in the sense that they maximize the multiple correlation. Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types; typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline) functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted to be monotonic, preserving the ordinal information in the data. In addition to optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge regression, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net. The resulting method will be called ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the basic OS algorithm provides straightforward and efficient estimation of the regularized regression coefficients, automatically gives the Group Lasso and Blockwise Sparse Regression, and extends them with monotonicity properties. We will show that Optimal Scaling linearizes nonlinear relationships between predictors and outcome, and improves upon the condition of the predictor correlation matrix, increasing (on average) the conditional independence of the predictors. Alternative options for regularization of either regression coefficients or category quantifications are mentioned. Extended examples are provided.   Keywords: Categorical Data, Optimal Scaling, Conditional Independence, Step Functions, Splines, Monotonic Transformations, Regularization, Lasso, Elastic Net, Group Lasso, Blockwise Sparse Regression."}
{"text": "We propose a method for finding alternate features missing in the Lasso optimal solution. In ordinary Lasso problem, one global optimum is obtained and the resulting features are interpreted as task-relevant features. However, this can overlook possibly relevant features not selected by the Lasso. With the proposed method, we can provide not only the Lasso optimal solution but also possible alternate features to the Lasso solution. We show that such alternate features can be computed efficiently by avoiding redundant computations. We also demonstrate how the proposed method works in the 20 newsgroup data, which shows that reasonable features are found as alternate features."}
{"text": "This work brings together two powerful concepts in Gaussian processes: the variational approach to sparse approximation and the spectral representation of Gaussian processes. This gives rise to an approximation that inherits the benefits of the variational approach but with the representational power and computational scalability of spectral representations. The work hinges on a key result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances. We derive these expressions for Matern kernels in one dimension, and generalize to more dimensions using kernels with specific structures. Under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise, our method requires only a single pass through the dataset, making for very fast and accurate computation. We fit a model to 4 million training points in just a few minutes on a standard laptop. With non-conjugate likelihoods, our MCMC scheme reduces the cost of computation from O(NM2) (for a sparse Gaussian process) to O(NM) per iteration, where N is the number of data and M is the number of features."}
{"text": "Over the years, ensemble methods have become a staple of machine learning. Similarly, generalized linear models (GLMs) have become very popular for a wide variety of statistical inference tasks. The former have been shown to enhance out- of-sample predictive power and the latter possess easy interpretability. Recently, ensembles of GLMs have been proposed as a possibility. On the downside, this approach loses the interpretability that GLMs possess. We show that minimum description length (MDL)-motivated compression of the inferred ensembles can be used to recover interpretability without much, if any, downside to performance and illustrate on a number of standard classification data sets."}
{"text": "There is a widespread need for techniques that can discover structure from time series data. Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to find structure within a single time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of temporal patterns, it is difficult to extend and can be brittle in practice. This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii) represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in Venture. The paper demonstrates an application to time series clustering that involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over both non-parametric and standard regression baselines."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimating the expected value of information (the knowledge gradient) for Bayesian learning problems where the belief model is nonlinear in the parameters. Our goal is to maximize some metric, while simultaneously learning the unknown parameters of the nonlinear belief model, by guiding a sequential experimentation process which is expensive. We overcome the problem of computing the expected value of an experiment, which is computationally intractable, by using a sampled approximation, which helps to guide experiments but does not provide an accurate estimate of the unknown parameters. We then introduce a resampling process which allows the sampled model to adapt to new information, exploiting past experiments. We show theoretically that the method converges asymptotically to the true parameters, while simultaneously maximizing our metric. We show empirically that the process exhibits rapid convergence, yielding good results with a very small number of experiments."}
{"text": "We present the Wright-Fisher Indian buffet process (WF-IBP), a probabilistic model for time-dependent data assumed to have been generated by an unknown number of latent features. This model is suitable as a prior in Bayesian nonparametric feature allocation models in which the features underlying the observed data exhibit a dependency structure over time. More specifically, we establish a new framework for generating dependent Indian buffet processes, where the Poisson random field model from population genetics is used as a way of constructing dependent beta processes. Inference in the model is complex, and we describe a sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for exact posterior simulation. We apply our construction to develop a nonparametric focused topic model for collections of time-stamped text documents and test it on the full corpus of NIPS papers published from 1987 to 2015."}
{"text": "Decision makers, such as doctors and judges, make crucial decisions such as recommending treatments to patients, and granting bails to defendants on a daily basis. Such decisions typically involve weighting the potential benefits of taking an action against the costs involved. In this work, we aim to automate this task of learning {cost-effective, interpretable and actionable treatment regimes. We formulate this as a problem of learning a decision list -- a sequence of if-then-else rules -- which maps characteristics of subjects (eg., diagnostic test results of patients) to treatments. We propose a novel objective to construct a decision list which maximizes outcomes for the population, and minimizes overall costs. We model the problem of learning such a list as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a variant of the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy which leverages customized checks for pruning the search space effectively. Experimental results on real world observational data capturing treatment recommendations for asthma patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

{"text": "The construction of synthetic complex-valued signals from real-valued observations is an important step in many time series analysis techniques. The most widely used approach is based on the Hilbert transform, which maps the real-valued signal into its quadrature component. In this paper, we define a probabilistic generalization of this approach. We model the observable real-valued signal as the real part of a latent complex-valued Gaussian process. In order to obtain the appropriate statistical relationship between its real and imaginary parts, we define two new classes of complex-valued covariance functions. Through an analysis of simulated chirplets and stochastic oscillations, we show that the resulting Gaussian process complex-valued signal provides a better estimate of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency than the established approaches. Furthermore, the complex-valued Gaussian process regression allows to incorporate prior information about the structure in signal and noise and thereby to tailor the analysis to the features of the signal. As a example, we analyze the non-stationary dynamics of brain oscillations in the alpha band, as measured using magneto-encephalography."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-dimensional tensor regression problems with low-rank structure. One of the core challenges associated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the underlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations could lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On the other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In this paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees for learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank structural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied to a potentially non-convex constraint set $\\Theta$ in terms of its \\emph{localized Gaussian width}. We juxtapose our theoretical results for non-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on regularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and non-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the non-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has desirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical upper bound perspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of examples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which address these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and convex approaches. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that, under several common settings of generalized low rank tensor regression, the projected gradient descent approach is superior both in terms of statistical error and run-time provided the step-sizes of the projected descent algorithm are suitably chosen."}

Typical variational inference methods, however, require to use inference networks with computationally tractable proba- bility density functions. This largely limits the design and implementation of vari- ational inference methods. We consider wild variational inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the inference networks, and hence can be applied in more challenging cases. As an example of application, we treat stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as an inference network, and use our methods to automatically adjust the step sizes of SGLD, yielding significant improvement over the hand-designed step size schemes"}
{"text": "We aim to create a framework for transfer learning using latent factor models to learn the dependence structure between a larger source dataset and a target dataset. The methodology is motivated by our goal of building a risk-assessment model for surgery patients, using both institutional and national surgical outcomes data. The national surgical outcomes data is collected through NSQIP (National Surgery Quality Improvement Program), a database housing almost 4 million patients from over 700 different hospitals. We build a latent factor model with a hierarchical prior on the loadings matrix to appropriately account for the different covariance structure in our data. We extend this model to handle more complex relationships between the populations by deriving a scale mixture formulation using stick-breaking properties. Our model provides a transfer learning framework that utilizes all information from both the source and target data, while modeling the underlying inherent differences between them."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel approach for parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationships, for which existing techniques exploiting graphical model structure are not applicable. Our approach is motivated by a model of seismic events and signals, where events detected in distant regions are approximately independent given those in intermediate regions. We perform parallel inference by coloring a factor graph defined over regions of latent space, rather than individual model variables. Evaluating on a model of seismic event detection, we achieve significant speedups over serial MCMC with no degradation in inference quality."}
{"text": "Noise injection (NI) is an efficient technique to mitigate over-fitting in neural networks (NNs). The Bernoulli NI procedure as implemented in dropout and shakeout has connections with $l_1$ and $l_2$ regularization for the NN model parameters. We propose whiteout, a family NI regularization techniques (NIRT) through injecting adaptive Gaussian noises during the training of NNs. Whiteout is the first NIRT than imposes a broad range of the $l_{\\gamma}$ sparsity regularization $(\\gamma\\in(0,2))$ without having to involving the $l_2$ regularization. Whiteout can also be extended to offer regularizations similar to the adaptive lasso and group lasso. We establish the regularization effect of whiteout in the framework of generalized linear models with closed-form penalty terms and show that whiteout stabilizes the training of NNs with decreased sensitivity to small perturbations in the input. We establish that the noise-perturbed empirical loss function (pelf) with whiteout converges almost surely to the ideal loss function (ilf), and the minimizer of the pelf is consistent for the minimizer of the ilf. We derive the tail bound on the pelf to establish the practical feasibility in its minimization. The superiority of whiteout over the Bernoulli NIRTs, dropout and shakeout, in learning NNs with relatively small-sized training sets and non-inferiority in large-sized training sets is demonstrated in both simulated and real-life data sets. This work represents the first in-depth theoretical, methodological, and practical examination of the regularization effects of both additive and multiplicative Gaussian NI in deep NNs."}
{"text": "Supervised topic models can help clinical researchers find interpretable cooccurence patterns in count data that are relevant for diagnostics. However, standard formulations of supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation have two problems. First, when documents have many more words than labels, the influence of the labels will be negligible. Second, due to conditional independence assumptions in the graphical model the impact of supervised labels on the learned topic-word probabilities is often minimal, leading to poor predictions on heldout data. We investigate penalized optimization methods for training sLDA that produce interpretable topic-word parameters and useful heldout predictions, using recognition networks to speed-up inference. We report preliminary results on synthetic data and on predicting successful anti-depressant medication given a patient's diagnostic history."}
{"text": "Bagging is a device intended for reducing the prediction error of learning algorithms. In its simplest form, bagging draws bootstrap samples from the training sample, applies the learning algorithm to each bootstrap sample, and then averages the resulting prediction rules.   We extend the definition of bagging from statistics to statistical functionals and study the von Mises expansion of bagged statistical functionals. We show that the expansion is related to the Efron-Stein ANOVA expansion of the raw (unbagged) functional. The basic observation is that a bagged functional is always smooth in the sense that the von Mises expansion exists and is finite of length 1 + resample size $M$. This holds even if the raw functional is rough or unstable. The resample size $M$ acts as a smoothing parameter, where a smaller $M$ means more smoothing."}
{"text": "We focus on the maximum regularization parameter for anisotropic total-variation denoising. It corresponds to the minimum value of the regularization parameter above which the solution remains constant. While this value is well know for the Lasso, such a critical value has not been investigated in details for the total-variation. Though, it is of importance when tuning the regularization parameter as it allows fixing an upper-bound on the grid for which the optimal parameter is sought. We establish a closed form expression for the one-dimensional case, as well as an upper-bound for the two-dimensional case, that appears reasonably tight in practice. This problem is directly linked to the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the divergence, which can be quickly obtained by performing convolutions in the Fourier domain."}

We compare the results of our algorithm with those of existing algorithms on synthetic data, and we provide examples of applications to real world text corpora for both single topic model and LDA, obtaining meaningful results."}
{"text": "The stochastic variational inference (SVI) paradigm, which combines variational inference, natural gradients, and stochastic updates, was recently proposed for large-scale data analysis in conjugate Bayesian models and demonstrated to be effective in several problems. This paper studies a family of Bayesian latent variable models with two levels of hidden variables but without any conjugacy requirements, making several contributions in this context. The first is observing that SVI, with an improved structured variational approximation, is applicable under more general conditions than previously thought with the only requirement being that the approximating variational distribution be in the same family as the prior. The resulting approach, Monte Carlo Structured SVI (MC-SSVI), significantly extends the scope of SVI, enabling large-scale learning in non-conjugate models. For models with latent Gaussian variables we propose a hybrid algorithm, using both standard and natural gradients, which is shown to improve stability and convergence. Applications in mixed effects models, sparse Gaussian processes, probabilistic matrix factorization and correlated topic models demonstrate the generality of the approach and the advantages of the proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "Spectral analysis of neighborhood graphs is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data analysis, with applications ranging from machine learning to social sciences. In such applications, it is typical to first encode relationships between the data samples using an appropriate similarity function. Popular neighborhood construction techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are known to be very sensitive to the choice of parameters, and more importantly susceptible to noise and varying densities. In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of the local scales. In addition to being highly resilient to noise or outlying data, the proposed approach does not require extensive parameter tuning unlike several existing methods. Using applications in spectral clustering and single-example label propagation, we show that the proposed neighborhood graphs outperform existing locally scaled graph construction approaches."}
{"text": "Many popular network models rely on the assumption of (vertex) exchangeability, in which the distribution of the graph is invariant to relabelings of the vertices. However, the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or empty with probability one, whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure."}

The idea is to treat indicators of causal relationships between variables as `labels' and to exploit available data on the variables of interest to provide features for the labelling task.

To illustrate the key ideas, we develop a distance-based approach (based on bivariate histograms) within a manifold regularization framework. We present empirical results on three different biological data sets (including examples where causal effects can be verified by experimental intervention), that together demonstrate the efficacy and general nature of the approach as well as its simplicity from a user's point of view."}
{"text": "Tuning parameter selection is of critical importance for kernel ridge regression. To this date, data driven tuning method for divide-and-conquer kernel ridge regression (d-KRR) has been lacking in the literature, which limits the applicability of d-KRR for large data sets. In this paper, by modifying the Generalized Cross-validation (GCV, Wahba, 1990) score, we propose a distributed Generalized Cross-Validation (dGCV) as a data-driven tool for selecting the tuning parameters in d-KRR. Not only the proposed dGCV is computationally scalable for massive data sets, it is also shown, under mild conditions, to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that minimizing the dGCV score is equivalent to minimizing the true global conditional empirical loss of the averaged function estimator, extending the existing optimality results of GCV to the divide-and-conquer framework."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel multivariate random process producing Bernoulli outputs per dimension, that can possibly formalize binary interactions in various graphical structures and can be used to model opinion dynamics, epidemics, financial and biological time series data, etc. We call this a Bernoulli Autoregressive Process (BAR). A BAR process models a discrete-time vector random sequence of $p$ scalar Bernoulli processes with autoregressive dynamics and corresponds to a particular Markov Chain. The benefit from the autoregressive dynamics is the description of a $2^p\\times 2^p$ transition matrix by at most $pd$ effective parameters for some $d\\ll p$ or by two sparse matrices of dimensions $p\\times p^2$ and $p\\times p$, respectively, parameterizing the transitions. Additionally, we show that the BAR process mixes rapidly, by proving that the mixing time is $O(\\log p)$. The hidden constant in the previous mixing time bound depends explicitly on the values of the chain parameters and implicitly on the maximum allowed in-degree of a node in the corresponding graph. For a network with $p$ nodes, where each node has in-degree at most $d$ and corresponds to a scalar Bernoulli process generated by a BAR, we provide a greedy algorithm that can efficiently learn the structure of the underlying directed graph with a sample complexity proportional to the mixing time of the BAR process. The sample complexity of the proposed algorithm is nearly order-optimal as it is only a $\\log p$ factor away from an information-theoretic lower bound. We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our algorithm in various setups, including a model for a biological signaling network."}

In detail, the proposed method distributes the $d$-dimensional data of size $N$ generated from a transelliptical graphical model into $m$ worker machines, and estimates the latent precision matrix on each worker machine based on the data of size $n=N/m$. It then debiases the local estimators on the worker machines and send them back to the master machine. Finally, on the master machine, it aggregates the debiased local estimators by averaging and hard thresholding. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimator based on all the data, provided that the number of machines satisfies $m \\lesssim \\min\\{N\\log d/d,\\sqrt{N/(s^2\\log d)}\\}$, where $s$ is the maximum number of nonzero entries in each column of the latent precision matrix.

We show how, by using second-order multi-set statistics in J-BSS, a specific double coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (DC-CPD) problem can be formulated. We propose an algebraic DC-CPD algorithm based on a coupled rank-1 detection mapping. This algorithm converts a possibly underdetermined DC-CPD to a set of overdetermined CPDs. The latter can be solved algebraically via a generalized eigenvalue decomposition based scheme. Therefore, this algorithm is deterministic and returns the exact solution in the noiseless case. In the noisy case, it can be used to effectively initialize optimization based DC-CPD algorithms. In addition, we obtain the determini- stic and generic uniqueness conditions for DC-CPD, which are shown to be more relaxed than their CPD counterpart. Experiment results are given to illustrate the superiority of DC-CPD over standard CPD based BSS methods and several existing J-BSS methods, with regards to uniqueness and accuracy."}
{"text": "Personalized treatment of patients based on tissue-specific cancer subtypes has strongly increased the efficacy of the chosen therapies. Even though the amount of data measured for cancer patients has increased over the last years, most cancer subtypes are still diagnosed based on individual data sources (e.g. gene expression data). We propose an unsupervised data integration method based on kernel principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in data analysis. Unfortunately, the straight-forward multiple-kernel extension of this method leads to the use of only one of the input matrices, which does not fit the goal of gaining information from all data sources. Therefore, we present a scoring function to determine the impact of each input matrix. The approach enables visualizing the integrated data and subsequent clustering for cancer subtype identification. Due to the nature of the method, no free parameters have to be set. We apply the methodology to five different cancer data sets and demonstrate its advantages in terms of results and usability."}

In the case with noisy observations, we prove that our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate up to the minimax optimal statistical error. And in the noiseless setting, our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix and achieves exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. Most notably, the overall computational complexity of our proposed algorithm, which is defined as the iteration complexity times per iteration time complexity, is lower than the state-of-the-art algorithms based on gradient descent. Experiments on synthetic data corroborate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms."}

The goal is to understand the brain by trying to find the function that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of the stimulus. Experimental stimuli are becoming increasingly complex with more and more people being interested in studying real life phenomena such as the perception of natural images or natural sentences. There is therefore a need for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the stimulus, that we can obtain using advances in machine learning.   In parallel, new ML approaches, many of which in deep learning, are inspired to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently, processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings about brain function, and it is unclear whether it is at all beneficial for machine learning to try to emulate brain function in order to achieve the same tasks that the brain achieves."}
{"text": "Recent years have seen an increasing popularity of learning the sparse \\emph{changes} in Markov Networks. Changes in the structure of Markov Networks reflect alternations of interactions between random variables under different regimes and provide insights into the underlying system. While each individual network structure can be complicated and difficult to learn, the overall change from one network to another can be simple. This intuition gave birth to an approach that \\emph{directly} learns the sparse changes without modelling and learning the individual (possibly dense) networks. In this paper, we review such a direct learning method with some latest developments along this line of research."}
{"text": "Gaussian graphical model is a graphical representation of the dependence structure for a Gaussian random vector. It is recognized as a powerful tool in different applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech language, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection is a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample of a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection are suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family of individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach leads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical procedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic of these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing literature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect edge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also important to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type II error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection problem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of statistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses. Additive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We construct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine them to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure. We show that the obtained procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the linear combination of expected numbers of Type I and Type II errors in the class of unbiased multiple decision procedures."}
{"text": "We propose a generic framework based on a new stochastic variance-reduced gradient descent algorithm for accelerating nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery. Starting from an appropriate initial estimator, our proposed algorithm performs projected gradient descent based on a novel semi-stochastic gradient specifically designed for low-rank matrix recovery. Based upon the mild restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions, we derive a projected notion of the restricted Lipschitz continuous gradient property, and prove that our algorithm enjoys linear convergence rate to the unknown low-rank matrix with an improved computational complexity. Moreover, our algorithm can be employed to both noiseless and noisy observations, where the optimal sample complexity and the minimax optimal statistical rate can be attained respectively. We further illustrate the superiority of our generic framework through several specific examples, both theoretically and experimentally."}
{"text": "In this article, a large dimensional performance analysis of kernel least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is provided under the assumption of a two-class Gaussian mixture model for the input data. Building upon recent advances in random matrix theory, we show, when the dimension of data $p$ and their number $n$ are both large, that the LS-SVM decision function can be well approximated by a normally distributed random variable, the mean and variance of which depend explicitly on a local behavior of the kernel function. This theoretical result is then applied to the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets which, despite their non-Gaussianity, exhibit a convincingly close behavior. Most importantly, our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism into play in SVM-type methods and in particular of the impact on the choice of the kernel function as well as some of their theoretical limits in separating high dimensional Gaussian vectors."}
{"text": "More and more processes governing our lives use in some part an automatic decision step, where -- based on a feature vector derived from an applicant -- an algorithm has the decision power over the final outcome. Here we present a simple idea which gives some of the power back to the applicant by providing her with alternatives which would make the decision algorithm decide differently. It is based on a formalization reminiscent of methods used for evasion attacks, and consists in enumerating the subspaces where the classifiers decides the desired output. This has been implemented for the specific case of decision forests (ensemble methods based on decision trees), mapping the problem to an iterative version of enumerating $k$-cliques."}
{"text": "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a multivariate statistical technique for finding the linear relationship between two sets of variables. The kernel generalization of CCA named kernel CCA has been proposed to find nonlinear relations between datasets. Despite their wide usage, they have one common limitation that is the lack of sparsity in their solution. In this paper, we consider sparse kernel CCA and propose a novel sparse kernel CCA algorithm (SKCCA). Our algorithm is based on a relationship between kernel CCA and least squares. Sparsity of the dual transformations is introduced by penalizing the $\\ell_{1}$-norm of dual vectors. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm not only performs well in computing sparse dual transformations but also can alleviate the over-fitting problem of kernel CCA."}
{"text": "Regression models are increasingly built using datasets which do not follow a design of experiment. Instead, the data is e.g. gathered by an automated monitoring of a technical system. As a consequence, already the input data represents phenomena of the system and violates statistical assumptions of distributions. The input data can show correlations, clusters or other patterns. Further, the distribution of input data influences the reliability of regression models. We propose criteria to quantify typical phenomena of input data for regression and show their suitability with simulated benchmark datasets.   -----   Regressionen werden zunehmend auf Datens\\\"atzen angewendet, deren Eingangsvektoren nicht durch eine statistische Versuchsplanung festgelegt wurden.

{"text": "Gaussian processes (GPs) have been proven to be powerful tools in various areas of machine learning. However, there are very few applications of GPs in the scenario of multi-view learning. In this paper, we present a new GP model for multi-view learning. Unlike existing methods, it combines multiple views by regularizing marginal likelihood with the consistency among the posterior distributions of latent functions from different views. Moreover, we give a general point selection scheme for multi-view learning and improve the proposed model by this criterion. Experimental results on multiple real world data sets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model and witnessed the performance improvement through employing this novel point selection scheme."}
{"text": "Random forest (RF) missing data algorithms are an attractive approach for dealing with missing data. They have the desirable properties of being able to handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings. Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms but relatively little guidance about their efficacy, which motivated us to study their performance. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting---the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Performance of algorithms was assessed by ability to impute data accurately. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing not at random."}
{"text": "Estimation of individual treatment effect in observational data is complicated due to the challenges of confounding and selection bias. A useful inferential framework to address this is the counterfactual (potential outcomes) model which takes the hypothetical stance of asking what if an individual had received both treatments. Making use of random forests (RF) within the counterfactual framework we estimate individual treatment effects by directly modeling the response. We find accurate estimation of individual treatment effects is possible even in complex heterogeneous settings but that the type of RF approach plays an important role in accuracy. Methods designed to be adaptive to confounding, when used in parallel with out-of-sample estimation, do best. One method found to be especially promising is counterfactual synthetic forests. We illustrate this new methodology by applying it to a large comparative effectiveness trial, Project Aware, in order to explore the role drug use plays in sexual risk. The analysis reveals important connections between risky behavior, drug usage, and sexual risk."}
{"text": "Stability is an important aspect of a classification procedure because unstable predictions can potentially reduce users' trust in a classification system and also harm the reproducibility of scientific conclusions. The major goal of our work is to introduce a novel concept of classification instability, i.e., decision boundary instability (DBI), and incorporate it with the generalization error (GE) as a standard for selecting the most accurate and stable classifier. Specifically, we implement a two-stage algorithm: (i) initially select a subset of classifiers whose estimated GEs are not significantly different from the minimal estimated GE among all the candidate classifiers; (ii) the optimal classifier is chosen as the one achieving the minimal DBI among the subset selected in stage (i). This general selection principle applies to both linear and nonlinear classifiers. Large-margin classifiers are used as a prototypical example to illustrate the above idea. Our selection method is shown to be consistent in the sense that the optimal classifier simultaneously achieves the minimal GE and the minimal DBI. Various simulations and real examples further demonstrate the advantage of our method over several alternative approaches."}
{"text": "Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified."}
{"text": "We consider the demixing problem of two (or more) high-dimensional vectors from nonlinear observations when the number of such observations is far less than the ambient dimension of the underlying vectors. Specifically, we demonstrate an algorithm that stably estimate the underlying components under general \\emph{structured sparsity} assumptions on these components. Specifically, we show that for certain types of structured superposition models, our method provably recovers the components given merely $n = \\mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$ denotes the number of nonzero entries in the underlying components. Moreover, our method achieves a fast (linear) convergence rate, and also exhibits fast (near-linear) per-iteration complexity for certain types of structured models. We also provide a range of simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "Random sinusoidal features are a popular approach for speeding up kernel-based inference in large datasets. Prior to the inference stage, the approach suggests performing dimensionality reduction by first multiplying each data vector by a random Gaussian matrix, and then computing an element-wise sinusoid. Theoretical analysis shows that collecting a sufficient number of such features can be reliably used for subsequent inference in kernel classification and regression.   In this work, we demonstrate that with a mild increase in the dimension of the embedding, it is also possible to reconstruct the data vector from such random sinusoidal features, provided that the underlying data is sparse enough. In particular, we propose a numerically stable algorithm for reconstructing the data vector given the nonlinear features, and analyze its sample complexity. Our algorithm can be extended to other types of structured inverse problems, such as demixing a pair of sparse (but incoherent) vectors. We support the efficacy of our approach via numerical experiments."}
{"text": "Heavy-tailed distributions are widely used in robust mixture modelling due to possessing thick tails. As a computationally tractable subclass of the stable distributions, sub-Gaussian $\\alpha$-stable distribution received much interest in the literature. Here, we introduce a type of expectation maximization algorithm that estimates parameters of a mixture of sub-Gaussian stable distributions. A comparative study, in the presence of some well-known mixture models, is performed to show the robustness and performance of the mixture of sub-Gaussian $\\alpha$-stable distributions for modelling, simulated, synthetic, and real data."}
{"text": "Subset selection in multiple linear regression aims to choose a subset of candidate explanatory variables that tradeoff fitting error (explanatory power) and model complexity (number of variables selected). We build mathematical programming models for regression subset selection based on mean square and absolute errors, and minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criteria. The proposed models are tested using a linear-program-based branch-and-bound algorithm with tailored valid inequalities and big M values and are compared against the algorithms in the literature. For high dimensional cases, an iterative heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the mathematical programming models and a core set concept, and a randomized version of the algorithm is derived to guarantee convergence to the global optimum. From the computational experiments, we find that our models quickly find a quality solution while the rest of the time is spent to prove optimality; the iterative algorithms find solutions in a relatively short time and are competitive compared to state-of-the-art algorithms; using ad-hoc big M values is not recommended."}
{"text": "Given functional data from a survival process with time-dependent covariates, we derive a smooth convex representation for its nonparametric log-likelihood functional and obtain its functional gradient. From this we devise a generic gradient boosting procedure for estimating the hazard function nonparametrically. An illustrative implementation of the procedure using regression trees is described to show how to recover the unknown hazard. We show that the generic estimator is consistent if the model is correctly specified; alternatively an oracle inequality can be demonstrated for tree-based models. To avoid overfitting, boosting employs several regularization devices. One of them is step-size restriction, but the rationale for this is somewhat mysterious from the viewpoint of consistency. Our work brings some clarity to this issue by revealing that step-size restriction is a mechanism for preventing the curvature of the risk from derailing convergence."}
{"text": "Prototypal analysis is introduced to overcome two shortcomings of archetypal analysis: its sensitivity to outliers and its non-locality, which reduces its applicability as a learning tool. Same as archetypal analysis, prototypal analysis finds prototypes through convex combination of the data points and approximates the data through convex combination of the archetypes, but it adds a penalty for using prototypes distant from the data points for their reconstruction. Prototypal analysis can be extended---via kernel embedding---to probability distributions, since the convexity of the prototypes makes them interpretable as mixtures. Finally, prototypal regression is developed, a robust supervised procedure which allows the use of distributions as either features or labels."}
{"text": "Forward regression is a statistical model selection and estimation procedure which inductively selects covariates that add predictive power into a working statistical regression model. Once a model is selected, unknown regression parameters are estimated by least squares. This paper analyzes forward regression in high-dimensional sparse linear models. Probabilistic bounds for prediction error norm and number of selected covariates are proved. The analysis in this paper gives sharp rates and does not require beta-min or irrepresentability conditions."}
{"text": "This paper presents a novel data-driven technique based on the spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) for energy/power prediction for complex dynamical systems. Built on symbolic dynamic filtering, the STPN framework is used to capture not only the individual system characteristics but also the pair-wise causal dependencies among different sub-systems. For quantifying the causal dependency, a mutual information based metric is presented. An energy prediction approach is subsequently proposed based on the STPN framework. For validating the proposed scheme, two case studies are presented, one involving wind turbine power prediction (supply side energy) using the Western Wind Integration data set generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics, and the other, residential electric energy disaggregation (demand side energy) using the Building America 2010 data set from NREL for exploring the temporal features. In the energy disaggregation context, convex programming techniques beyond the STPN framework are developed and applied to achieve improved disaggregation performance."}
{"text": "A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.   In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and other heuristics for posterior estimation."}
{"text": "Consumer Demand Response (DR) is an important research and industry problem, which seeks to categorize, predict and modify consumer's energy consumption. Unfortunately, traditional clustering methods have resulted in many hundreds of clusters, with a given consumer often associated with several clusters, making it difficult to classify consumers into stable representative groups and to predict individual energy consumption patterns. In this paper, we present a shape-based approach that better classifies and predicts consumer energy consumption behavior at the household level. The method is based on Dynamic Time Warping. DTW seeks an optimal alignment between energy consumption patterns reflecting the effect of hidden patterns of regular consumer behavior. Using real consumer 24-hour load curves from Opower Corporation, our method results in a 50% reduction in the number of representative groups and an improvement in prediction accuracy measured under DTW distance. We extend the approach to estimate which electrical devices will be used and in which hours."}
{"text": "This paper proposes a hierarchical feature extractor for non-stationary streaming time series based on the concept of switching observable Markov chain models. The slow time-scale non-stationary behaviors are considered to be a mixture of quasi-stationary fast time-scale segments that are exhibited by complex dynamical systems. The idea is to model each unique stationary characteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique characteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one low-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in the recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build an online algorithm suited for handling quasi-stationary data at a lower level and a non-stationary behavior at a higher level without a priori knowledge. A key observation made in this study is that the rate of change of data likelihood seems to be a better indicator of change in data characteristics compared to the traditional methods that mostly consider data likelihood for change detection. The algorithm minimizes model complexity and captures data likelihood. Efficacy demonstration and comparative evaluation of the proposed algorithm are performed using time series data simulated from systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. We discuss results that show that the proposed hierarchical SDF algorithm can identify underlying features with significantly high degree of accuracy, even under very noisy conditions. Algorithm is demonstrated to perform better than the baseline Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The low computational complexity of algorithm makes it suitable for on-board, real time operations."}
{"text": "In this work a robust clustering algorithm for stationary time series is proposed. The algorithm is based on the use of estimated spectral densities, which are considered as functional data, as the basic characteristic of stationary time series for clustering purposes. A robust algorithm for functional data is then applied to the set of spectral densities. Trimming techniques and restrictions on the scatter within groups reduce the effect of noise in the data and help to prevent the identification of spurious clusters. The procedure is tested in a simulation study, and is also applied to a real data set."}
{"text": "We propose a framework for modeling and estimating the state of controlled dynamical systems, where an agent can affect the system through actions and receives partial observations. Based on this framework, we propose the Predictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFFPSR). A key property in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditional distribution of future observations given future actions. RFF-PSRs combine this representation with moment-matching, kernel embedding and local optimization to achieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can represent controlled environments which can be affected by actions; it has an efficient and theoretically justified learning algorithm; it uses a non-parametric representation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-linear dynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method."}
{"text": "As data collections become larger, exploratory regression analysis becomes more important but more challenging. When observations are hierarchically clustered the problem is even more challenging because model selection with mixed effect models can produce misleading results when nonlinear effects are not included into the model (Bauer and Cai, 2009). A machine learning method called boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001) is a good approach for exploratory regression analysis in real data sets because it can detect predictors with nonlinear and interaction effects while also accounting for missing data. We propose an extension to boosted decision decision trees called metboost for hierarchically clustered data. It works by constraining the structure of each tree to be the same across groups, but allowing the terminal node means to differ. This allows predictors and split points to lead to different predictions within each group, and approximates nonlinear group specific effects. Importantly, metboost remains computationally feasible for thousands of observations and hundreds of predictors that may contain missing values. We apply the method to predict math performance for 15,240 students from 751 schools in data collected in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002 (Ingels et al., 2007), allowing 76 predictors to have unique effects for each school. When comparing results to boosted decision trees, metboost has 15% improved prediction performance. Results of a large simulation study show that metboost has up to 70% improved variable selection performance and up to 30% improved prediction performance compared to boosted decision trees when group sizes are small"}
{"text": "Statistical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) allows researchers to study local climate change effects decades into the future. A wide range of statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in machine learning have not been explored. In this paper, we compare four fundamental statistical methods, Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD), Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine, with three more advanced machine learning methods, Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning (MSSL), BCSD coupled with MSSL, and Convolutional Neural Networks to downscale daily precipitation in the Northeast United States. Metrics to evaluate of each method's ability to capture daily anomalies, large scale climate shifts, and extremes are analyzed. We find that linear methods, led by BCSD, consistently outperform non-linear approaches. The direct application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches."}
{"text": "Flow cytometry is a high-throughput technology used to quantify multiple surface and intracellular markers at the level of a single cell. This enables to identify cell sub-types, and to determine their relative proportions. Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells from a blood sample using multiple markers. This results in high-dimensional datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent (e.g. longitudinal studies). Here, we propose to use a Bayesian nonparametric approach with Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of multivariate skew $t$-distributions to perform model based clustering of flow-cytometry data. DPM models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding model selection issues, and skew $t$-distributions provides robustness to outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the DALIA-1 data. We have made the method available for the community in the R package NPflow."}
{"text": "Many modern data sets are sampled with error from complex high-dimensional surfaces. Methods such as tensor product splines or Gaussian processes are effective/well suited for characterizing a surface in two or three dimensions but may suffer from difficulties when representing higher dimensional surfaces. Motivated by high throughput toxicity testing where observed dose-response curves are cross sections of a surface defined by a chemical's structural properties, a model is developed to characterize this surface to predict untested chemicals' dose-responses. This manuscript proposes a novel approach that models the multidimensional surface as a sum of learned basis functions formed as the tensor product of lower dimensional functions, which are themselves representable by a basis expansion learned from the data. The model is described, a Gibbs sampling algorithm proposed, and is investigated in a simulation study as well as data taken from the US EPA's ToxCast high throughput toxicity testing platform."}
{"text": "We study additive models built with trend filtering, i.e., additive models whose components are each regularized by the (discrete) total variation of their $k$th (discrete) derivative, for a chosen integer $k \\geq 0$. This results in $k$th degree piecewise polynomial components, (e.g., $k=0$ gives piecewise constant components, $k=1$ gives piecewise linear, $k=2$ gives piecewise quadratic, etc.). Analogous to its advantages in the univariate case, additive trend filtering has favorable theoretical and computational properties, thanks in large part to the localized nature of the (discrete) total variation regularizer that it uses. On the theory side, we derive fast error rates for additive trend filtering estimates, and show these rates are minimax optimal when the underlying function is additive and has component functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation. We also show that these rates are unattainable by additive smoothing splines (and by additive models built from linear smoothers, in general). On the computational side, as per the standard in additive models, backfitting is an appealing method for optimization, but it is particularly appealing for additive trend filtering because we can leverage a few highly efficient univariate trend filtering solvers. Going one step further, we describe a new backfitting algorithm whose iterations can be run in parallel, which (as far as we know) is the first of its kind. Lastly, we present experiments to examine the empirical performance of additive trend filtering."}
{"text": "Estimating the state of a dynamical system from a series of noise-corrupted observations is fundamental in many areas of science and engineering. The most well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. Finally, we empirically validate our approach via the analysis of measured brain signals."}
{"text": "This paper introduces a method for efficiently inferring a high-dimensional distributed quantity from a few observations. The quantity of interest (QoI) is approximated in a basis (dictionary) learned from a training set. The coefficients associated with the approximation of the QoI in the basis are determined by minimizing the misfit with the observations. To obtain a probabilistic estimate of the quantity of interest, a Bayesian approach is employed. The QoI is treated as a random field endowed with a hierarchical prior distribution so that closed-form expressions can be obtained for the posterior distribution. The main contribution of the present work lies in the derivation of \\emph{a representation basis consistent with the observation chain} used to infer the associated coefficients. The resulting dictionary is then tailored to be both observable by the sensors and accurate in approximating the posterior mean. An algorithm for deriving such an observable dictionary is presented. The method is illustrated with the estimation of the velocity field of an open cavity flow from a handful of wall-mounted point sensors. Comparison with standard estimation approaches relying on Principal Component Analysis and K-SVD dictionaries is provided and illustrates the superior performance of the present approach."}
{"text": "SAGA is a fast incremental gradient method on the finite sum problem and its effectiveness has been tested on a vast of applications. In this paper, we analyze SAGA on a class of non-strongly convex and non-convex statistical problem such as Lasso, group Lasso, Logistic regression with $\\ell_1$ regularization, linear regression with SCAD regularization and Correct Lasso. We prove that SAGA enjoys the linear convergence rate up to the statistical estimation accuracy, under the assumption of restricted strong convexity (RSC). It significantly extends the applicability of SAGA in convex and non-convex optimization."}
{"text": "Background: Statistical mechanics results (Dauphin et al. (2014); Choromanska et al. (2015)) suggest that local minima with high error are exponentially rare in high dimensions. However, to prove low error guarantees for Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs), previous works so far required either a heavily modified MNN model or training method, strong assumptions on the labels (e.g., \"near\" linear separability), or an unrealistic hidden layer with $\\Omega\\left(N\\right)$ units.   Results: We examine a MNN with one hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a single output, and a quadratic loss. We prove that, with high probability in the limit of $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ datapoints, the volume of differentiable regions of the empiric loss containing sub-optimal differentiable local minima is exponentially vanishing in comparison with the same volume of global minima, given standard normal input of dimension $d_{0}=\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\sqrt{N}\\right)$, and a more realistic number of $d_{1}=\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(N/d_{0}\\right)$ hidden units. We demonstrate our results numerically: for example, $0\\%$ binary classification training error on CIFAR with only $N/d_{0}\\approx 16$ hidden neurons."}
{"text": "Hypothesis tests in models whose dimension far exceeds the sample size can be formulated much like the classical studentized tests only after the initial bias of estimation is removed successfully. The theory of debiased estimators can be developed in the context of quantile regression models for a fixed quantile value. However, it is frequently desirable to formulate tests based on the quantile regression process, as this leads to more robust tests and more stable confidence sets. Additionally, inference in quantile regression requires estimation of the so called sparsity function, which depends on the unknown density of the error. In this paper we consider a debiasing approach for the uniform testing problem. We develop high-dimensional regression rank scores and show how to use them to estimate the sparsity function, as well as how to adapt them for inference involving the quantile regression process. Furthermore, we develop a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in a location-shift high-dimensional models and confidence sets that are uniformly valid for many quantile values. The main technical result are the development of a Bahadur representation of the debiasing estimator that is uniform over a range of quantiles and uniform convergence of the quantile process to the Brownian bridge process, which are of independent interest. Simulation studies illustrate finite sample properties of our procedure."}
{"text": "Many statistical learning problems can be posed as minimization of a sum of two convex functions, one typically a composition of non-smooth and linear functions. Examples include regression under structured sparsity assumptions. Popular algorithms for solving such problems, e.g., ADMM, often involve non-trivial optimization subproblems or smoothing approximation. We consider two classes of primal-dual algorithms that do not incur these difficulties, and unify them from a perspective of monotone operator theory. From this unification we propose a continuum of preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting algorithms amenable to parallel and distributed computing. For the entire region of convergence of the whole continuum of algorithms, we establish its rates of convergence. For some known instances of this continuum, our analysis closes the gap in theory. We further exploit the unification to propose a continuum of accelerated algorithms. We show that the whole continuum attains the theoretically optimal rate of convergence. The scalability of the proposed algorithms, as well as their convergence behavior, is demonstrated up to 1.2 million variables with a distributed implementation."}

{"text": "We propose a unified framework to solve general low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery problems based on matrix factorization, which covers a broad family of objective functions satisfying the restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions. Based on projected gradient descent and the double thresholding operator, our proposed generic algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unknown low-rank and sparse matrices at a locally linear rate, while matching the best-known robustness guarantee (i.e., tolerance for sparsity). At the core of our theory is a novel structural Lipschitz gradient condition for low-rank plus sparse matrices, which is essential for proving the linear convergence rate of our algorithm, and we believe is of independent interest to prove fast rates for general superposition-structured models. We illustrate the application of our framework through two concrete examples: robust matrix sensing and robust PCA. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods have been heavily exploited to analyse the association between two blocs of data. These powerful approaches can be applied to data sets where the number of variables is greater than the number of observations and in presence of high collinearity between variables. Different sparse versions of PLS have been developed to integrate multiple data sets while simultaneously selecting the contributing variables. Sparse modelling is a key factor in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between multiple data sets. The cornerstone of the sparsity version of PLS methods is the link between the SVD of a matrix (constructed from deflated versions of the original matrices of data) and least squares minimisation in linear regression. We present here an accurate description of the most popular PLS methods, alongside their mathematical proofs. A unified algorithm is proposed to perform all four types of PLS including their regularised versions. Various approaches to decrease the computation time are offered, and we show how the whole procedure can be scalable to big data sets."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose PCKID, a novel, robust, kernel function for spectral clustering, specifically designed to handle incomplete data. By combining posterior distributions of Gaussian Mixture Models for incomplete data on different scales, we are able to learn a kernel for incomplete data that does not depend on any critical hyperparameters, unlike the commonly used RBF kernel. To evaluate our method, we perform experiments on two real datasets. PCKID outperforms the baseline methods for all fractions of missing values and in some cases outperforms the baseline methods with up to 25 percentage points."}
{"text": "Learning rates for least-squares regression are typically expressed in terms of $L_2$-norms. In this paper we extend these rates to norms stronger than the $L_2$-norm without requiring the regression function to be contained in the hypothesis space. In the special case of Sobolev reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces used as hypotheses spaces, these stronger norms coincide with fractional Sobolev norms between the used Sobolev space and $L_2$. As a consequence, not only the target function but also some of its derivatives can be estimated without changing the algorithm. From a technical point of view, we combine the well-known integral operator techniques with an embedding property, which so far has only been used in combination with empirical process arguments. This combination results in new finite sample bounds with respect to the stronger norms. From these finite sample bounds our rates easily follow. Finally, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our results in many cases."}
{"text": "We present an approach to deep estimation of discrete conditional probability distributions. Such models have several applications, including generative modeling of audio, image, and video data. Our approach combines two main techniques: dyadic partitioning and graph-based smoothing of the discrete space. By recursively decomposing each dimension into a series of binary splits and smoothing over the resulting distribution using graph-based trend filtering, we impose a strict structure to the model and achieve much higher sample efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model through a series of benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets, in some cases reducing the error by nearly half in comparison to other popular methods in the literature. All of our models are implemented in Tensorflow and publicly available at https://github.com/tansey/sdp ."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimating a regression function in the common situation where the number of features is small, where interpretability of the model is a high priority, and where simple linear or additive models fail to provide adequate performance. To address this problem, we present GapTV, an approach that is conceptually related both to CART and to the more recent CRISP algorithm, a state-of-the-art alternative method for interpretable nonlinear regression. GapTV divides the feature space into blocks of constant value and fits the value of all blocks jointly via a convex optimization routine. Our method is fully data-adaptive, in that it incorporates highly robust routines for tuning all hyperparameters automatically. We compare our approach against CART and CRISP and demonstrate that GapTV finds a much better trade-off between accuracy and interpretability."}
{"text": "Microwave-based breast cancer detection has been proposed as a complementary approach to compensate for some drawbacks of existing breast cancer detection techniques. Among the existing microwave breast cancer detection methods, machine learning-type algorithms have recently become more popular. These focus on detecting the existence of breast tumours rather than performing imaging to identify the exact tumour position. A key step of the machine learning approaches is feature extraction. One of the most widely used feature extraction method is principle component analysis (PCA). However, it can be sensitive to signal misalignment. This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based feature extraction method, which is more robust to the misalignment. Experimental results involving clinical data sets combined with numerically simulated tumour responses show that combined features from EMD and PCA improve the detection performance with an ensemble selection-based classifier."}
{"text": "We present a model for random simple graphs with a degree distribution that obeys a power law (i.e., is heavy-tailed). To attain this behavior, the edge probabilities in the graph are constructed from Bertoin-Fujita-Roynette-Yor (BFRY) random variables, which have been recently utilized in Bayesian statistics for the construction of power law models in several applications. Our construction readily extends to capture the structure of latent factors, similarly to stochastic blockmodels, while maintaining its power law degree distribution. The BFRY random variables are well approximated by gamma random variables in a variational Bayesian inference routine, which we apply to several network datasets for which power law degree distributions are a natural assumption. By learning the parameters of the BFRY distribution via probabilistic inference, we are able to automatically select the appropriate power law behavior from the data. In order to further scale our inference procedure, we adopt stochastic gradient ascent routines where the gradients are computed on minibatches (i.e., subsets) of the edges in the graph."}
{"text": "The pseudo-likelihood method is one of the most popular algorithms for learning sparse binary pairwise Markov networks. In this paper, we formulate the $L_1$ regularized pseudo-likelihood problem as a sparse multiple logistic regression problem. In this way, many insights and optimization procedures for sparse logistic regression can be applied to the learning of discrete Markov networks. Specifically, we use the coordinate descent algorithm for generalized linear models with convex penalties, combined with strong screening rules, to solve the pseudo-likelihood problem with $L_1$ regularization. Therefore a substantial speedup without losing any accuracy can be achieved. Furthermore, this method is more stable than the node-wise logistic regression approach on unbalanced high-dimensional data when penalized by small regularization parameters. Thorough numerical experiments on simulated data and real world data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel kernel that models input-dependent couplings across multiple latent processes. The pairwise joint kernel measures covariance along inputs and across different latent signals in a mutually-dependent fashion. A latent correlation Gaussian process (LCGP) model combines these non-stationary latent components into multiple outputs by an input-dependent mixing matrix. Probit classification and support for multiple observation sets are derived by Variational Bayesian inference. Results on several datasets indicate that the LCGP model can recover the correlations between latent signals while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance. We highlight the latent covariances with an EEG classification dataset where latent brain processes and their couplings simultaneously emerge from the model."}
{"text": "Training Gaussian process-based models typically involves an $ O(N^3)$ computational bottleneck due to inverting the covariance matrix. Popular methods for overcoming this matrix inversion problem cannot adequately model all types of latent functions, and are often not parallelizable. However, judicious choice of model structure can ameliorate this problem. A mixture-of-experts model that uses a mixture of $K$ Gaussian processes offers modeling flexibility and opportunities for scalable inference. Our embarrassingly parallel algorithm combines low-dimensional matrix inversions with importance sampling to yield a flexible, scalable mixture-of-experts model that offers comparable performance to Gaussian process regression at a much lower computational cost."}
{"text": "We propose a novel method for semi-supervised learning (SSL) based on data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) using optimal transport metrics. Our proposed method enhances generalization error by using the unlabeled data to restrict the support of the worst case distribution in our DRO formulation. We enable the implementation of our DRO formulation by proposing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm which allows to easily implement the training procedure. We demonstrate that our Semi-supervised DRO method is able to improve the generalization error over natural supervised procedures and state-of-the-art SSL estimators. Finally, we include a discussion on the large sample behavior of the optimal uncertainty region in the DRO formulation. Our discussion exposes important aspects such as the role of dimension reduction in SSL."}
{"text": "We study a fundamental class of regression models called the second order linear model (SLM). The SLM extends the linear model to high order functional space and has attracted considerable research interest recently. Yet how to efficiently learn the SLM under full generality using nonconvex solver still remains an open question due to several fundamental limitations of the conventional gradient descent learning framework. In this study, we try to attack this problem from a gradient-free approach which we call the moment-estimation-sequence (MES) method. We show that the conventional gradient descent heuristic is biased by the skewness of the distribution therefore is no longer the best practice of learning the SLM. Based on the MES framework, we design a nonconvex alternating iteration process to train a $d$-dimension rank-$k$ SLM within $O(kd)$ memory and one-pass of the dataset. The proposed method converges globally and linearly, achieves $\\epsilon$ recovery error after retrieving $O[k^{2}d\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(kd/\\epsilon)]$ samples. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals that not all SLMs can be learned on every sub-gaussian distribution. When the instances are sampled from a so-called $\\tau$-MIP distribution, the SLM can be learned by $O(p/\\tau^{2})$ samples where $p$ and $\\tau$ are positive constants depending on the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution. For non-MIP distribution, an addition diagonal-free oracle is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the learnability of the SLM. Numerical simulations verify the sharpness of our bounds on the sampling complexity and the linear convergence rate of our algorithm."}
{"text": "We consider a modification of the covariance function in Gaussian processes to correctly account for known linear constraints. By modelling the target function as a transformation of an underlying function, the constraints are explicitly incorporated in the model such that they are guaranteed to be fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. We also propose a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and illustrate the result on both simulated and real-data examples."}
{"text": "Computing partition function is the most important statistical inference task arising in applications of Graphical Models (GM). Since it is computationally intractable, approximate methods have been used to resolve the issue in practice, where mean-field (MF) and belief propagation (BP) are arguably the most popular and successful approaches of a variational type. In this paper, we propose two new variational schemes, coined Gauged-MF (G-MF) and Gauged-BP (G-BP), improving MF and BP, respectively. Both provide lower bounds for the partition function by utilizing the so-called gauge transformation which modifies factors of GM while keeping the partition function invariant. Moreover, we prove that both G-MF and G-BP are exact for GMs with a single loop of a special structure, even though the bare MF and BP perform badly in this case. Our extensive experiments, on complete GMs of relatively small size and on large GM (up-to 300 variables) confirm that the newly proposed algorithms outperform and generalize MF and BP."}
{"text": "This paper studies a new Bayesian algorithm for the joint reconstruction and classification of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images, with application to the identification of human skin lentigo. The proposed Bayesian approach takes advantage of the distribution of the multiplicative speckle noise affecting the true reflectivity of these images and of appropriate priors for the unknown model parameters. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the model parameters and the image of true reflectivity while classifying images according to the distribution of their reflectivity. Precisely, a Metropolis-whitin-Gibbs sampler is investigated to sample the posterior distribution of the Bayesian model associated with RCM images and to build estimators of its parameters, including labels indicating the class of each RCM image. The resulting algorithm is applied to synthetic data and to real images from a clinical study containing healthy and lentigo patients."}
{"text": "Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling."}
{"text": "Yield curve forecasting is an important problem in finance. In this work we explore the use of Gaussian Processes in conjunction with a dynamic modeling strategy, much like the Kalman Filter, to model the yield curve. Gaussian Processes have been successfully applied to model functional data in a variety of applications. A Gaussian Process is used to model the yield curve. The hyper-parameters of the Gaussian Process model are updated as the algorithm receives yield curve data. Yield curve data is typically available as a time series with a frequency of one day. We compare existing methods to forecast the yield curve with the proposed method. The results of this study showed that while a competing method (a multivariate time series method) performed well in forecasting the yields at the short term structure region of the yield curve, Gaussian Processes perform well in the medium and long term structure regions of the yield curve. Accuracy in the long term structure region of the yield curve has important practical implications. The Gaussian Process framework yields uncertainty and probability estimates directly in contrast to other competing methods. Analysts are frequently interested in this information. In this study the proposed method has been applied to yield curve forecasting, however it can be applied to model high frequency time series data or data streams in other domains."}
{"text": "We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines. Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense."}
{"text": "We study two procedures (reverse-mode and forward-mode) for computing the gradient of the validation error with respect to the hyperparameters of any iterative learning algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent. These procedures mirror two methods of computing gradients for recurrent neural networks and have different trade-offs in terms of running time and space requirements. Our formulation of the reverse-mode procedure is linked to previous work by Maclaurin et al. [2015] but does not require reversible dynamics. The forward-mode procedure is suitable for real-time hyperparameter updates, which may significantly speed up hyperparameter optimization on large datasets. We present experiments on data cleaning and on learning task interactions. We also present one large-scale experiment where the use of previous gradient-based methods would be prohibitive."}
{"text": "Inspired by the importance of diversity in biological system, we built an heterogeneous system that could achieve this goal. Our architecture could be summarized in two basic steps. First, we generate a diverse set of classification hypothesis using both Convolutional Neural Networks, currently the state-of-the-art technique for this task, among with other traditional and innovative machine learning techniques. Then, we optimally combine them through Meta-Nets, a family of recently developed and performing ensemble methods."}
{"text": "Deep generative models have been wildly successful at learning coherent latent representations for continuous data such as video and audio. However, generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions and molecular structures still poses significant challenges. Crucially, state-of-the-art methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which encodes and decodes directly to and from these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always valid. Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs, it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and molecular synthesis."}
{"text": "We discuss a Bayesian formulation to coarse-graining (CG) of PDEs where the coefficients (e.g. material parameters) exhibit random, fine scale variability. The direct solution to such problems requires grids that are small enough to resolve this fine scale variability which unavoidably requires the repeated solution of very large systems of algebraic equations. We establish a physically inspired, data-driven coarse-grained model which learns a low- dimensional set of microstructural features that are predictive of the fine-grained model (FG) response. Once learned, those features provide a sharp distribution over the coarse scale effec- tive coefficients of the PDE that are most suitable for prediction of the fine scale model output. This ultimately allows to replace the computationally expensive FG by a generative proba- bilistic model based on evaluating the much cheaper CG several times. Sparsity enforcing pri- ors further increase predictive efficiency and reveal microstructural features that are important in predicting the FG response. Moreover, the model yields probabilistic rather than single-point predictions, which enables the quantification of the unavoidable epistemic uncertainty that is present due to the information loss that occurs during the coarse-graining process."}
{"text": "The goal of the paper is to design sequential strategies which lead to efficient optimization of an unknown function under the only assumption that it has a finite Lipschitz constant. We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H\\\"older like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization."}
{"text": "We study dual volume sampling, a method for selecting k columns from an n x m short and wide matrix (n <= k <= m) such that the probability of selection is proportional to the volume spanned by the rows of the induced submatrix. This method was proposed by Avron and Boutsidis (2013), who showed it to be a promising method for column subset selection and its multiple applications. However, its wider adoption has been hampered by the lack of polynomial time sampling algorithms. We remove this hindrance by developing an exact (randomized) polynomial time sampling algorithm as well as its derandomization. Thereafter, we study dual volume sampling via the theory of real stable polynomials and prove that its distribution satisfies the \"Strong Rayleigh\" property. This result has numerous consequences, including a provably fast-mixing Markov chain sampler that makes dual volume sampling much more attractive to practitioners. This sampler is closely related to classical algorithms for popular experimental design methods that are to date lacking theoretical analysis but are known to empirically work well."}
{"text": "Density ratio estimation is a vital tool in both machine learning and statistical community. However, due to the unbounded nature of density ratio, the estimation procedure can be vulnerable to corrupted data points, which often pushes the estimated ratio toward infinity. In this paper, we present a robust estimator which automatically identifies and trims outliers. The proposed estimator has a convex formulation, and the global optimum can be obtained via subgradient descent. We analyze the parameter estimation error of this estimator under high-dimensional settings. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the estimator."}
{"text": "We present mlrMBO, a flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization (MBO), also known as Bayesian optimization, which addresses the problem of expensive black-box optimization by approximating the given objective function through a surrogate regression model. It is designed for both single- and multi-objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and conditional parameters. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal, parallelization, visualization, logging and error-handling. mlrMBO is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases, e.g., any regression learner from the mlr toolbox for machine learning can be used, and infill criteria and infill optimizers are easily exchangeable. We empirically demonstrate that mlrMBO provides state-of-the-art performance by comparing it on different benchmark scenarios against a wide range of other optimizers, including DiceOptim, rBayesianOptimization, SPOT, SMAC, Spearmint, and Hyperopt."}
{"text": "Indian Buffet Process based models are an elegant way for discovering underlying features within a data set, but inference in such models can be slow. Inferring underlying features using Markov chain Monte Carlo either relies on an uncollapsed representation, which leads to poor mixing, or on a collapsed representation, which leads to a quadratic increase in computational complexity. Existing attempts at distributing inference have introduced additional approximation within the inference procedure. In this paper we present a novel algorithm to perform asymptotically exact parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo inference for Indian Buffet Process models. We take advantage of the fact that the features are conditionally independent under the beta-Bernoulli process. Because of this conditional independence, we can partition the features into two parts: one part containing only the finitely many instantiated features and the other part containing the infinite tail of uninstantiated features. For the finite partition, parallel inference is simple given the instantiation of features. But for the infinite tail, performing uncollapsed MCMC leads to poor mixing and hence we collapse out the features. The resulting hybrid sampler, while being parallel, produces samples asymptotically from the true posterior."}
{"text": "We show that DBSCAN can estimate the connected components of the $\\lambda$-density level set $\\{ x : f(x) \\ge \\lambda\\}$ given $n$ i.i.d. samples from an unknown density $f$.

When the data lies in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ we obtain a rate of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\\beta + D)})$, which matches known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. When the data lies on an embedded unknown $d$-dimensional manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, then we obtain a rate of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\\beta + d\\cdot \\max\\{1, \\beta \\})})$. Finally, we provide adaptive parameter tuning in order to attain these rates with no a priori knowledge of the intrinsic dimension, density, or $\\beta$."}
{"text": "The present study proposes a deep learning model, named DeepSleepNet, for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw single-channel EEG. Most of the existing methods rely on hand-engineered features which require prior knowledge of sleep analysis. Only a few of them encode the temporal information such as transition rules, which is important for identifying the next sleep stages, into the extracted features. In the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to extract time-invariant features, and bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory to learn transition rules among sleep stages automatically from EEG epochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm to train our model efficiently. We evaluated our model using different single-channel EEGs (F4-EOG(Left), Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) from two public sleep datasets, that have different properties (e.g., sampling rate) and scoring standards (AASM and R&K). The results showed that our model achieved similar overall accuracy and macro F1-score (MASS: 86.2%-81.7, Sleep-EDF: 82.0%-76.9) compared to the state-of-the-art methods (MASS: 85.9%-80.5, Sleep-EDF: 78.9%-73.7) on both datasets. This demonstrated that, without changing the model architecture and the training algorithm, our model could automatically learn features for sleep stage scoring from different raw single-channel EEGs from different datasets without utilizing any hand-engineered features."}
{"text": "We propose a novel Bayesian Optimization approach for black-box functions with an environmental variable whose value determines the tradeoff between evaluation cost and the fidelity of the evaluations. Further, we use a novel approach to sampling support points, allowing faster construction of the acquisition function. This allows us to achieve optimization with lower overheads than previous approaches and is implemented for a more general class of problem. We show this approach to be effective on synthetic and real world benchmark problems."}
{"text": "Gaussian process model for vector-valued function has been shown to be useful for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to re-formulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, re-formulation is not always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student$-t$ distribution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce a novel multivariate Student$-t$ process regression model (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and real data examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets."}
{"text": "We present a method for conditional time series forecasting based on an adaptation of the recent deep convolutional WaveNet architecture. The proposed network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad range of history when forecasting, a ReLU activation function and conditioning is performed by applying multiple convolutional filters in parallel to separate time series which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. We test and analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally as well as conditionally for financial time series forecasting using the S&P500, the volatility index, the CBOE interest rate and several exchange rates and extensively compare it to the performance of the well-known autoregressive model and a long-short term memory network. We show that a convolutional network is well-suited for regression-type problems and is able to effectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long historical time series, is a time-efficient and easy to implement alternative to recurrent-type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models."}
{"text": "We propose a probabilistic model to aggregate the answers of respondents answering multiple-choice questions. The model does not assume that everyone has access to the same information, and so does not assume that the consensus answer is correct. Instead, it infers the most probable world state, even if only a minority vote for it. Each respondent is modeled as receiving a signal contingent on the actual world state, and as using this signal to both determine their own answer and predict the answers given by others. By incorporating respondent's predictions of others' answers, the model infers latent parameters corresponding to the prior over world states and the probability of different signals being received in all possible world states, including counterfactual ones. Unlike other probabilistic models for aggregation, our model applies to both single and multiple questions, in which case it estimates each respondent's expertise. The model shows good performance, compared to a number of other probabilistic models, on data from seven studies covering different types of expertise."}
{"text": "The goal of data clustering is to partition data points into groups to minimize a given objective function. While most existing clustering algorithms treat each data point as vector, in many applications each datum is not a vector but a point pattern or a set of points. Moreover, many existing clustering methods require the user to specify the number of clusters, which is not available in advance. This paper proposes a new class of models for data clustering that addresses set-valued data as well as unknown number of clusters, using a Dirichlet Process mixture of Poisson random finite sets. We also develop an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior inference technique that can learn the number of clusters and mixture parameters automatically from the data. Numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the salient features of this new model, in particular its capacity to discover extremely unbalanced clusters in data."}
{"text": "We propose a data aggregation-based algorithm with monotonic convergence to a global optimum for a generalized version of the L1-norm error fitting model with an assumption of the fitting function. The proposed algorithm generalizes the recent algorithm in the literature, aggregate and iterative disaggregate (AID), which selectively solves three specific L1-norm error fitting problems. With the proposed algorithm, any L1-norm error fitting model can be solved optimally if it follows the form of the L1-norm error fitting problem and if the fitting function satisfies the assumption. The proposed algorithm can also solve multi-dimensional fitting problems with arbitrary constraints on the fitting coefficients matrix. The generalized problem includes popular models such as regression and the orthogonal Procrustes problem. The results of the computational experiment show that the proposed algorithms are faster than the state-of-the-art benchmarks for L1-norm regression subset selection and L1-norm regression over a sphere. Further, the relative performance of the proposed algorithm improves as data size increases."}
{"text": "This work addresses various open questions in the theory of active learning for nonparametric classification. Our contributions are both statistical and algorithmic: -We establish new minimax-rates for active learning under common \\textit{noise conditions}. These rates display interesting transitions -- due to the interaction between noise \\textit{smoothness and margin} -- not present in the passive setting. Some such transitions were previously conjectured, but remained unconfirmed. -We present a generic algorithmic strategy for adaptivity to unknown noise smoothness and margin; our strategy achieves optimal rates in many general situations; furthermore, unlike in previous work, we avoid the need for \\textit{adaptive confidence sets}, resulting in strictly milder distributional requirements."}
{"text": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning is one of the most popular methods in machine learning. Some of its theoretical properties such as bounds for the generalization error and the convergence of the graph Laplacian regularizer have been studied in computer science and statistics literatures. However, a fundamental statistical property, the consistency of the estimator from this method has not been proved. In this article, we study the consistency problem under a non-parametric framework. We prove the consistency of graph-based learning in the case that the estimated scores are enforced to be equal to the observed responses for the labeled data. The sample sizes of both labeled and unlabeled data are allowed to grow in this result. When the estimated scores are not required to be equal to the observed responses, a tuning parameter is used to balance the loss function and the graph Laplacian regularizer. We give a counterexample demonstrating that the estimator for this case can be inconsistent. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies."}
{"text": "Bandit methods for black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation, are used in a variety of applications including hyper-parameter tuning and experiment design. Recently, \\emph{multi-fidelity} methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. In many practical applications however, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space $(N,T)$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments."}

In Section 2, we present both the intuition behind and a theoretically sound framework to construct coresets for general problems and apply it to $k$-means clustering. In Section 3 we summarize existing coreset construction algorithms for a variety of machine learning problems such as maximum likelihood estimation of mixture models, Bayesian non-parametric models, principal component analysis, regression and general empirical risk minimization."}
{"text": "The massive amount of available data potentially used to discover patters in machine learning is a challenge for kernel based algorithms with respect to runtime and storage capacities. Local approaches might help to relieve these issues. From a statistical point of view local approaches allow additionally to deal with different structures in the data in different ways. This paper analyses properties of localized kernel based, non-parametric statistical machine learning methods, in particular of support vector machines (SVMs) and methods close to them. We will show there that locally learnt kernel methods are universal consistent. Furthermore, we give an upper bound for the maxbias in order to show statistical robustness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "Kernel embeddings of distributions and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), the resulting distance between distributions, are useful tools for fully nonparametric two-sample testing and learning on distributions. However, it is rarely that all possible differences between samples are of interest -- discovered differences can be due to different types of measurement noise, data collection artefacts or other irrelevant sources of variability. We propose distances between distributions which encode invariance to additive symmetric noise, aimed at testing whether the assumed true underlying processes differ. Moreover, we construct invariant features of distributions, leading to learning algorithms robust to the impairment of the input distributions with symmetric additive noise."}
{"text": "We present the first treatment of the arc length of the Gaussian Process (GP) with more than a single output dimension. GPs are commonly used for tasks such as trajectory modelling, where path length is a crucial quantity of interest. Previously, only paths in one dimension have been considered, with no theoretical consideration of higher dimensional problems. We fill the gap in the existing literature by deriving the moments of the arc length for a stationary GP with multiple output dimensions. A new method is used to derive the mean of a one-dimensional GP over a finite interval, by considering the distribution of the arc length integrand. This technique is used to derive an approximate distribution over the arc length of a vector valued GP in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by moment matching the distribution. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical derivations."}
{"text": "The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has recently been successfully applied in robust regression, classification and adaptive filtering, where the correntropy is maximized instead of minimizing the well-known mean square error (MSE) to improve the robustness with respect to outliers (or impulsive noises). Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop various robust adaptive algorithms under MCC, but so far little insight has been gained as to how the optimal solution will be affected by outliers. In this work, we study this problem in the context of parameter estimation for a simple linear errors-in-variables (EIV) model where all variables are scalar. Under certain conditions, we derive an upper bound on the absolute value of the estimation error and show that the optimal solution under MCC can be very close to the true value of the unknown parameter even with outliers (whose values can be arbitrarily large) in both input and output variables. Illustrative examples are presented to verify and clarify the theory."}
{"text": "Inferring the correct answers to binary tasks based on multiple noisy answers in an unsupervised manner has emerged as the canonical question for micro-task crowdsourcing or more generally aggregating opinions. In graphon estimation, one is interested in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes using a single snapshot of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from graphon estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than the {\\em majority voting} scheme for a setup that goes beyond the {\\em rank one} models considered in the literature. We use known explicit lower bounds for crowdsourcing to provide refined lower bounds for graphon estimation."}
{"text": "How can we train a statistical mixture model on a massive data set? In this work we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians. A coreset is a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models fitting the coreset also provide a good fit for the original data set. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size polynomial in dimension and the number of mixture components, while being independent of the data set size. Hence, one can harness computationally intensive algorithms to compute a good approximation on a significantly smaller data set. More importantly, such coresets can be efficiently constructed both in distributed and streaming settings and do not impose restrictions on the data generating process. Our results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in computational geometry and new combinatorial complexity results for mixtures of Gaussians. Empirical evaluation on several real-world datasets suggests that our coreset-based approach enables significant reduction in training-time with negligible approximation error."}
{"text": "There is growing interest in applying machine learning methods to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Across different institutions, however, EMR quality can vary widely. This work investigated the impact of this disparity on the performance of three advanced machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and recurrent neural network. The EMR disparity was emulated using different permutations of the EMR collected at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU). The algorithms were trained using patients from the PICU to predict in-ICU mortality for patients in a held out set of PICU and CTICU patients. The disparate patient populations between the PICU and CTICU provide an estimate of generalization errors across different ICUs. We quantified and evaluated the generalization of these algorithms on varying EMR size, input types, and fidelity of data."}
{"text": "This paper deals with the problem of large-scale linear supervised learning in settings where a large number of continuous features are available. We propose to combine the well-known trick of one-hot encoding of continuous features with a new penalization called \\emph{binarsity}. In each group of binary features coming from the one-hot encoding of a single raw continuous feature, this penalization uses total-variation regularization together with an extra linear constraint. This induces two interesting properties on the model weights of the one-hot encoded features: they are piecewise constant, and are eventually block sparse. Non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for generalized linear models are proposed. Moreover, under a sparse additive model assumption, we prove that our procedure matches the state-of-the-art in this setting. Numerical experiments illustrate the good performances of our approach on several datasets. It is also noteworthy that our method has a numerical complexity comparable to standard $\\ell_1$ penalization."}
{"text": "Integrating visual and linguistic information into a single multimodal representation is an unsolved problem with wide-reaching applications to both natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we present a simple method to build multimodal representations by learning a language-to-vision mapping and using its output to build multimodal embeddings. In this sense, our method provides a cognitively plausible way of building representations, consistent with the inherently re-constructive and associative nature of human memory. Using seven benchmark concept similarity tests we show that the mapped vectors not only implicitly encode multimodal information, but also outperform strong unimodal baselines and state-of-the-art multimodal methods, thus exhibiting more \"human-like\" judgments---particularly in zero-shot settings."}
{"text": "Existing strategies for finite-armed stochastic bandits mostly depend on a parameter of scale that must be known in advance. Sometimes this is in the form of a bound on the payoffs, or the knowledge of a variance or subgaussian parameter. The notable exceptions are the analysis of Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance by Cowan and Katehakis [2015] and of uniform distributions with unknown support [Cowan and Katehakis, 2015]. The results derived in these specialised cases are generalised here to the non-parametric setup, where the learner knows only a bound on the kurtosis of the noise, which is a scale free measure of the extremity of outliers."}
{"text": "We consider the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in linear quadratic (LQ) control problems, where the state dynamics is linear and the cost function is quadratic in states and controls. We analyze the regret of Thompson sampling (TS) (a.k.a. posterior-sampling for reinforcement learning) in the frequentist setting, i.e., when the parameters characterizing the LQ dynamics are fixed. Despite the empirical and theoretical success in a wide range of problems from multi-armed bandit to linear bandit, we show that when studying the frequentist regret TS in control problems, we need to trade-off the frequency of sampling optimistic parameters and the frequency of switches in the control policy. This results in an overall regret of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is significantly worse than the regret $O(\\sqrt{T})$ achieved by the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty algorithm in LQ control problems."}
{"text": "We implemented several multilabel classification algorithms in the machine learning package mlr. The implemented methods are binary relevance, classifier chains, nested stacking, dependent binary relevance and stacking, which can be used with any base learner that is accessible in mlr. Moreover, there is access to the multilabel classification versions of randomForestSRC and rFerns. All these methods can be easily compared by different implemented multilabel performance measures and resampling methods in the standardized mlr framework. In a benchmark experiment with several multilabel datasets, the performance of the different methods is evaluated."}
{"text": "In the scenario of real-time monitoring of hospital patients, high-quality inference of patients' health status using all information available from clinical covariates and lab tests is essential to enable successful medical interventions and improve patient outcomes. Developing a computational framework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) and make accurate real-time predictions is a critical step. In this work, we develop and explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on Gaussian process (GP) regression for hospital patient monitoring. We propose MedGP, a statistical framework that incorporates 24 clinical and lab covariates and supports a rich reference data set from which relationships between observed covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of patient state over time. To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP kernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points while estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and periodicity in patient observations. MedGP has a number of benefits over current methods, including (i) not requiring an alignment of the time series data, (ii) quantifying confidence regions in the predictions, (iii) exploiting a vast and rich database of patients, and (iv) inferring interpretable relationships among clinical covariates. We evaluate and compare results from MedGP on the task of online prediction for three patient subgroups from two medical data sets across 8,043 patients. We found MedGP improves online prediction over baseline methods for nearly all covariates across different disease subgroups and studies. The publicly available code is at https://github.com/bee-hive/MedGP."}
{"text": "The development of computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction methods that significantly reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining high image quality is an important area of research in low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging. We propose a new penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) reconstruction method that exploits regularization based on an efficient Union of Learned TRAnsforms (PWLS-ULTRA). The union of square transforms is pre-learned from numerous image patches extracted from a dataset of CT images or volumes. The proposed PWLS-based cost function is optimized by alternating between a CT image reconstruction step, and a sparse coding and clustering step. The CT image reconstruction step is accelerated by a relaxed linearized augmented Lagrangian method with ordered-subsets that reduces the number of forward and back projections. Simulations with 2-D and 3-D axial CT scans of the extended cardiac-torso phantom and 3D helical chest and abdomen scans show that for both normal-dose and low-dose levels, the proposed method significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images compared to PWLS reconstruction with a nonadaptive edge-preserving regularizer (PWLS-EP). PWLS with regularization based on a union of learned transforms leads to better image reconstructions than using a single learned square transform. We also incorporate patch-based weights in PWLS-ULTRA that enhance image quality and help improve image resolution uniformity. The proposed approach achieves comparable or better image quality compared to learned overcomplete synthesis dictionaries, but importantly, is much faster (computationally more efficient)."}
{"text": "Objectives: Discussions of fairness in criminal justice risk assessments typically lack conceptual precision. Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this paper, we seek to clarify the tradeoffs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy.   Methods: We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments.   Results: We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy.   Conclusions: Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time, and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging tradeoffs."}
{"text": "Analyzing multivariate time series data is important to predict future events and changes of complex systems in finance, manufacturing, and administrative decisions. The expressiveness power of Gaussian Process (GP) regression methods has been significantly improved by compositional covariance structures. In this paper, we present a new GP model which naturally handles multiple time series by placing an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior on the presence of shared kernels. Our selective covariance structure decomposition allows exploiting shared parameters over a set of multiple, selected time series. We also investigate the well-definedness of the models when infinite latent components are introduced. We present a pragmatic search algorithm which explores a larger structure space efficiently. Experiments conducted on five real-world data sets demonstrate that our new model outperforms existing methods in term of structure discoveries and predictive performances."}
{"text": "We consider a generalization of low-rank matrix completion to the case where the data belongs to an algebraic variety, i.e. each data point is a solution to a system of polynomial equations. In this case the original matrix is possibly high-rank, but it becomes low-rank after mapping each column to a higher dimensional space of monomial features. Many well-studied extensions of linear models, including affine subspaces and their union, can be described by a variety model. In addition, varieties can be used to model a richer class of nonlinear quadratic and higher degree curves and surfaces. We study the sampling requirements for matrix completion under a variety model with a focus on a union of affine subspaces. We also propose an efficient matrix completion algorithm that minimizes a convex or non-convex surrogate of the rank of the matrix of monomial features. Our algorithm uses the well-known \"kernel trick\" to avoid working directly with the high-dimensional monomial matrix. We show the proposed algorithm is able to recover synthetically generated data up to the predicted sampling complexity bounds. The proposed algorithm also outperforms standard low rank matrix completion and subspace clustering techniques in experiments with real data."}
{"text": "In high-dimensional and/or non-parametric regression problems, regularization (or penalization) is used to control model complexity and induce desired structure. Each penalty has a weight parameter that indicates how strongly the structure corresponding to that penalty should be enforced. Typically the parameters are chosen to minimize the error on a separate validation set using a simple grid search or a gradient-free optimization method. It is more efficient to tune parameters if the gradient can be determined, but this is often difficult for problems with non-smooth penalty functions. Here we show that for many penalized regression problems, the validation loss is actually smooth almost-everywhere with respect to the penalty parameters. We can therefore apply a modified gradient descent algorithm to tune parameters. Through simulation studies on example regression problems, we find that increasing the number of penalty parameters and tuning them using our method can decrease the generalization error."}
{"text": "Spectral clustering is a popular and versatile clustering method based on a relaxation of the normalised graph cut objective. Despite its popularity, however, there is no single agreed upon method for tuning the important scaling parameter, nor for determining automatically the number of clusters to extract. Popular heuristics exist, but corresponding theoretical results are scarce. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic value of the normalised cut for an increasing sample assumed to arise from an underlying probability distribution, and based on this result provide recommendations for improving spectral clustering methodology. A corresponding algorithm is proposed with strong empirical performance."}
{"text": "The trade-off between the cost of acquiring and processing data, and uncertainty due to a lack of data is fundamental in machine learning. A basic instance of this trade-off is the problem of deciding when to make noisy and costly observations of a discrete-time Gaussian random walk, so as to minimise the posterior variance plus observation costs. We present the first proof that a simple policy, which observes when the posterior variance exceeds a threshold, is optimal for this problem. The proof generalises to a wide range of cost functions other than the posterior variance.   This result implies that optimal policies for linear-quadratic-Gaussian control with costly observations have a threshold structure. It also implies that the restless bandit problem of observing multiple such time series, has a well-defined Whittle index. We discuss computation of that index, give closed-form formulae for it, and compare the performance of the associated index policy with heuristic policies.   The proof is based on a new verification theorem that demonstrates threshold structure for Markov decision processes, and on the relation between binary sequences known as mechanical words and the dynamics of discontinuous nonlinear maps, which frequently arise in physics, control and biology."}
{"text": "Objective: In this work, we perform margin assessment of human breast tissue from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using deep neural networks (DNNs). This work simulates an intraoperative setting for breast cancer lumpectomy. Methods: To train the DNNs, we use both the state-of-the-art methods (Weight Decay and DropOut) and a newly introduced regularization method based on function norms. Commonly used methods can fail when only a small database is available. The use of a function norm introduces a direct control over the complexity of the function with the aim of diminishing the risk of overfitting. Results: As neither the code nor the data of previous results are publicly available, the obtained results are compared with reported results in the literature for a conservative comparison. Moreover, our method is applied to locally collected data on several data configurations. The reported results are the average over the different trials. Conclusion: The experimental results show that the use of DNNs yields significantly better results than other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, G-mean and Matthews correlation coefficient. Function norm regularization yielded higher and more robust results than competing methods. Significance: We have demonstrated a system that shows high promise for (partially) automated margin assessment of human breast tissue, Equal error rate (EER) is reduced from approximately 12\\% (the lowest reported in the literature) to 5\\%\\,--\\,a 58\\% reduction. The method is computationally feasible for intraoperative application (less than 2 seconds per image)."}
{"text": "Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results."}
{"text": "Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 - 2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers."}
{"text": "An exciting branch of machine learning research focuses on methods for learning, optimizing, and integrating unknown functions that are difficult or costly to evaluate. A popular Bayesian approach to this problem uses a Gaussian process (GP) to construct a posterior distribution over the function of interest given a set of observed measurements, and selects new points to evaluate using the statistics of this posterior. Here we extend these methods to exploit derivative information from the unknown function. We describe methods for Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian quadrature (BQ) in settings where first and second derivatives may be evaluated along with the function itself. We perform sampling-based inference in order to incorporate uncertainty over hyperparameters, and show that both hyperparameter and function uncertainty decrease much more rapidly when using derivative information. Moreover, we introduce techniques for overcoming ill-conditioning issues that have plagued earlier methods for gradient-enhanced Gaussian processes and kriging. We illustrate the efficacy of these methods using applications to real and simulated Bayesian optimization and quadrature problems, and show that exploting derivatives can provide substantial gains over standard methods."}

A new formulation of sparse coding is proposed which enables high dimensional tensors dictionary-based canonical polyadic decomposition. The benefits of using a dictionary in tensor decomposition models are explored both in terms of parameter identifiability and estimation accuracy. Performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated on the decomposition of simulated data and the unmixing of hyperspectral images."}
{"text": "It has recently been shown that many of the existing quasi-Newton algorithms can be formulated as learning algorithms, capable of learning local models of the cost functions. Importantly, this understanding allows us to safely start assembling probabilistic Newton-type algorithms, applicable in situations where we only have access to noisy observations of the cost function and its derivatives. This is where our interest lies.   We make contributions to the use of the non-parametric and probabilistic Gaussian process models in solving these stochastic optimisation problems. Specifically, we present a new algorithm that unites these approximations together with recent probabilistic line search routines to deliver a probabilistic quasi-Newton approach.   We also show that the probabilistic optimisation algorithms deliver promising results on challenging nonlinear system identification problems where the very nature of the problem is such that we can only access the cost function and its derivative via noisy observations, since there are no closed-form expressions available."}
{"text": "We study a model where one target variable Y is correlated with a vector X:=(X_1,...,X_d) of predictor variables being potential causes of Y. We describe a method that infers to what extent the statistical dependences between X and Y are due to the influence of X on Y and to what extent due to a hidden common cause (confounder) of X and Y. The method relies on concentration of measure results for large dimensions d and an independence assumption stating that, in the absence of confounding, the vector of regression coefficients describing the influence of each X on Y typically has `generic orientation' relative to the eigenspaces of the covariance matrix of X. For the special case of a scalar confounder we show that confounding typically spoils this generic orientation in a characteristic way that can be used to quantitatively estimate the amount of confounding."}
{"text": "Cluster analysis of very high dimensional data can benefit from the properties of such high dimensionality. Informally expressed, in this work, our focus is on the analogous situation when the dimensionality is moderate to small, relative to a massively sized set of observations. Mathematically expressed, these are the dual spaces of observations and attributes. The point cloud of observations is in attribute space, and the point cloud of attributes is in observation space. In this paper, we begin by summarizing various perspectives related to methodologies that are used in multivariate analytics. We draw on these to establish an efficient clustering processing pipeline, both partitioning and hierarchical clustering."}
{"text": "Integrative analysis of disparate data blocks measured on a common set of experimental subjects is a major challenge in modern data analysis. This data structure naturally motivates the simultaneous exploration of the joint and individual variation within each data block resulting in new insights. For instance, there is a strong desire to integrate the multiple genomic data sets in The Cancer Genome Atlas to characterize the common and also the unique aspects of cancer genetics and cell biology for each source. In this paper we introduce Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained capturing both joint and individual variation within each data block. This is a major improvement over earlier approaches to this challenge in terms of a new conceptual understanding, much better adaption to data heterogeneity and a fast linear algebra computation. Important mathematical contributions are the use of score subspaces as the principal descriptors of variation structure and the use of perturbation theory as the guide for variation segmentation. This leads to an exploratory data analysis method which is insensitive to the heterogeneity among data blocks and does not require separate normalization. An application to cancer data reveals different behaviors of each type of signal in characterizing tumor subtypes. An application to a mortality data set reveals interesting historical lessons.

{"text": "The \"least absolute shrinkage and selection operator\" (Lasso) method has been adapted recently for networkstructured datasets. In particular, this network Lasso method allows to learn graph signals from a small number of noisy signal samples by using the total variation of a graph signal for regularization. While efficient and scalable implementations of the network Lasso are available, only little is known about the conditions on the underlying network structure which ensure network Lasso to be accurate. By leveraging concepts of compressed sensing, we address this gap and derive precise conditions on the underlying network topology and sampling set which guarantee the network Lasso for a particular loss function to deliver an accurate estimate of the entire underlying graph signal. We also quantify the error incurred by network Lasso in terms of two constants which reflect the connectivity of the sampled nodes."}

We consider an application to the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) fields from two information sources, along-track altimeter data and sea surface temperature (SST) data.

A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which, with interactive graphics, can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this paper, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations.

We also consider the connections between the Kernel Score and the minimum risk of a proper loss function. We show that the Kernel Score incorporates more information pertaining to the projected embedded distributions compared to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy.

{"text": "Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals."}
{"text": "The standard interpretation of importance-weighted autoencoders is that they maximize a tighter lower bound on the marginal likelihood than the standard evidence lower bound.

{"text": "Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged during the last few years as an effective approach to optimizing black-box functions where direct queries of the objective are expensive. In this paper we consider the case where direct access to the function is not possible, but information about user preferences is. Such scenarios arise in problems where human preferences are modeled, such as A/B tests or recommender systems. We present a new framework for this scenario that we call Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) which allows us to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be queried through pairwise comparisons, the so-called duels. PBO extends the applicability of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by modeling the probability of the winner of each duel by means of a Gaussian process model with a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO. We illustrate the benefits of PBO in a variety of experiments, showing that PBO needs drastically fewer comparisons for finding the optimum. According to our experiments, the way of modeling correlations in PBO is key in obtaining this advantage."}

The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) provides a way to model the number of latent features required for a good approximation in terms of regularised reconstruction error. Previous work has focussed on latent feature vectors with independent entries. We extend the model to include nondiagonal latent covariance structures representing characteristics such as smoothness. This is done by . Using simulations we demonstrate that under appropriate conditions a smoothness prior helps to recover the true latent features, while denoising more accurately. We demonstrate our method on a real neuroimaging dataset, where computational tractability is a sufficient challenge that the efficient strategy presented here is essential."}
{"text": "The Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm has been widely used in solving nuclear norm constrained problems, since it does not require projections. However, FW often yields high rank intermediate iterates, which can be very expensive in time and space costs for large problems. To address this issue, we propose a rank-drop method for nuclear norm constrained problems. The goal is to generate descent steps that lead to rank decreases, maintaining low-rank solutions throughout the algorithm. Moreover, the optimization problems are constrained to ensure that the rank-drop step is also feasible and can be readily incorporated into a projection-free minimization method, e.g., Frank-Wolfe. We demonstrate that by incorporating rank-drop steps into the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the rank of the solution is greatly reduced compared to the original Frank-Wolfe or its common variants."}
{"text": "We show that $k$-means (Lloyd's algorithm) is obtained as a special case when truncated variational EM approximations are applied to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with isotropic Gaussians.

There are a number of consequences that directly follow from our approach: (A) $k$-means can be shown to increase a free energy associated with truncated distributions and this free energy can directly be reformulated in terms of the $k$-means objective; (B) $k$-means generalizations can directly be derived by considering the 2nd closest, 3rd closest etc. cluster in addition to just the closest one; and (C) the embedding of $k$-means into a free energy framework allows for theoretical interpretations of other $k$-means generalizations in the literature. In general, truncated variational EM provides a natural and rigorous quantitative link between $k$-means-like clustering and GMM clustering algorithms which may be very relevant for future theoretical and empirical studies."}
{"text": "Boosting as gradient descent algorithms is one popular method in machine learning. In this paper a novel Boosting-type algorithm is proposed based on restricted gradient descent with structural sparsity control whose underlying dynamics are governed by differential inclusions. In particular, we present an iterative regularization path with structural sparsity where the parameter is sparse under some linear transforms, based on variable splitting and the Linearized Bregman Iteration. Hence it is called \\emph{Split LBI}. Despite its simplicity, Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a proper early stopping, Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore, some $\\ell_2$ error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by several applications including image denoising, partial order ranking of sport teams, and world university grouping with crowdsourced ranking data."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of accelerating distributed optimization in multi-agent networks by sequentially adding edges. Specifically, we extend the distributed dual averaging (DDA) subgradient algorithm to evolving networks of growing connectivity and analyze the corresponding improvement in convergence rate. It is known that the convergence rate of DDA is influenced by the algebraic connectivity of the underlying network, where better connectivity leads to faster convergence. However, the impact of network topology design on the convergence rate of DDA has not been fully understood. In this paper, we begin by designing network topologies via edge selection and scheduling. For edge selection, we determine the best set of candidate edges that achieves the optimal tradeoff between the growth of network connectivity and the usage of network resources. The dynamics of network evolution is then incurred by edge scheduling. Further, we provide a tractable approach to analyze the improvement in the convergence rate of DDA induced by the growth of network connectivity. Our analysis reveals the connection between network topology design and the convergence rate of DDA, and provides quantitative evaluation of DDA acceleration for distributed optimization that is absent in the existing analysis. Lastly, numerical experiments show that DDA can be significantly accelerated using a sequence of well-designed networks, and our theoretical predictions are well matched to its empirical convergence behavior."}
{"text": "We propose a novel adaptive importance sampling algorithm which incorporates Stein variational gradient decent algorithm (SVGD) with importance sampling (IS). Our algorithm leverages the nonparametric transforms in SVGD to iteratively decrease the KL divergence between our importance proposal and the target distribution. The advantages of this algorithm are twofold: first, our algorithm turns SVGD into a standard IS algorithm, allowing us to use standard diagnostic and analytic tools of IS to evaluate and interpret the results; second, we do not restrict the choice of our importance proposal to predefined distribution families like traditional (adaptive) IS methods. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm performs well on evaluating partition functions of restricted Boltzmann machines and testing likelihood of variational auto-encoders."}
{"text": "Variational inference approximates the posterior distribution of a probabilistic model with a parameterized density by maximizing a lower bound for the model evidence. Modern solutions fit a flexible approximation with stochastic gradient descent, using Monte Carlo approximation for the gradients. This enables variational inference for arbitrary differentiable probabilistic models, and consequently makes variational inference feasible for probabilistic programming languages. In this work we develop more efficient inference algorithms for the task by considering importance sampling estimates for the gradients. We show how the gradient with respect to the approximation parameters can often be evaluated efficiently without needing to re-compute gradients of the model itself, and then proceed to derive practical algorithms that use importance sampled estimates to speed up computation.We present importance sampled stochastic gradient descent that outperforms standard stochastic gradient descent by a clear margin for a range of models, and provide a justifiable variant of stochastic average gradients for variational inference."}
{"text": "We study the problem of interactively learning a binary classifier using noisy labeling and pairwise comparison oracles, where the comparison oracle answers which one in the given two instances is more likely to be positive. Learning from such oracles has multiple applications where obtaining direct labels is harder but pairwise comparisons are easier, and the algorithm can leverage both types of oracles. In this paper, we attempt to characterize how the access to an easier comparison oracle helps in improving the label and total query complexity. We show that the comparison oracle reduces the learning problem to that of learning a threshold function. We then present an algorithm that interactively queries the label and comparison oracles and we characterize its query complexity under Tsybakov and adversarial noise conditions for the comparison and labeling oracles. Our lower bounds show that our label and total query complexity is almost optimal."}
{"text": "Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric function estimators. However, their applications are largely limited by the expensive computational cost of the inference procedures. Existing stochastic or distributed synchronous variational inferences, although have alleviated this issue by scaling up GPs to millions of samples, are still far from satisfactory for real-world large applications, where the data sizes are often orders of magnitudes larger, say, billions. To solve this problem, we propose ADVGP, the first Asynchronous Distributed Variational Gaussian Process inference for regression, on the recent large-scale machine learning platform, PARAMETERSERVER. ADVGP uses a novel, flexible variational framework based on a weight space augmentation, and implements the highly efficient, asynchronous proximal gradient optimization. While maintaining comparable or better predictive performance, ADVGP greatly improves upon the efficiency of the existing variational methods. With ADVGP, we effortlessly scale up GP regression to a real-world application with billions of samples and demonstrate an excellent, superior prediction accuracy to the popular linear models."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimating a consensus community structure by combining information from multiple layers of a multi-layer network using methods based on the spectral clustering or a low-rank matrix factorization. As a general theme, these \"intermediate fusion\" methods involve obtaining a low column rank matrix by optimizing an objective function and then using the columns of the matrix for clustering. However, the theoretical properties of these methods remain largely unexplored. In the absence of statistical guarantees on the objective functions, it is difficult to determine if the algorithms optimizing the objectives will return good community structures. We investigate the consistency properties of the global optimizer of some of these objective functions under the multi-layer stochastic blockmodel. For this purpose, we derive several new asymptotic results showing consistency of the intermediate fusion techniques along with the spectral clustering of mean adjacency matrix under a high dimensional setup, where the number of nodes, the number of layers and the number of communities of the multi-layer graph grow. Our numerical study shows that the intermediate fusion techniques outperform late fusion methods, namely spectral clustering on aggregate spectral kernel and module allegiance matrix in sparse networks, while they outperform the spectral clustering of mean adjacency matrix in multi-layer networks that contain layers with both homophilic and heterophilic communities."}
{"text": "Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that iteratively transports a set of particles to approximate given distributions, based on an efficient gradient-based update that guarantees to optimally decrease the KL divergence within a function space. This paper develops the first theoretical analysis on SVGD, discussing its weak convergence properties and showing that its asymptotic behavior is captured by a gradient flow of the KL divergence functional under a new metric structure induced by Stein operator. We also provide a number of results on Stein operator and Stein's identity using the notion of weak derivative, including a new proof of the distinguishability of Stein discrepancy under weak conditions."}
{"text": "The current work characterizes the users of a VoD streaming space through user-personas based on a tenure timeline and temporal behavioral features in the absence of explicit user profiles. A combination of tenure timeline and temporal characteristics caters to business needs of understanding the evolution and phases of user behavior as their accounts age. The personas constructed in this work successfully represent both dominant and niche characterizations while providing insightful maturation of user behavior in the system. The two major highlights of our personas are demonstration of stability along tenure timelines on a population level, while exhibiting interesting migrations between labels on an individual granularity and clear interpretability of user labels. Finally, we show a trade-off between an indispensable trio of guarantees, relevance-scalability-interpretability by using summary information from personas in a CTR (Click through rate) predictive model. The proposed method of uncovering latent personas, consequent insights from these and application of information from personas to predictive models are broadly applicable to other streaming based products."}
{"text": "We give convergence guarantees for estimating the coefficients of a symmetric mixture of two linear regressions by expectation maximization (EM). In particular, we show that the empirical EM iterates converge to the target parameter vector at the parametric rate, provided the algorithm is initialized in an unbounded cone. In particular, if the initial guess has a sufficiently large cosine angle with the target parameter vector, a sample-splitting version of the EM algorithm converges to the true coefficient vector with high probability. Interestingly, our analysis borrows from tools used in the problem of estimating the centers of a symmetric mixture of two Gaussians by EM. We also show that the population EM operator for mixtures of two regressions is anti-contractive from the target parameter vector if the cosine angle between the input vector and the target parameter vector is too small, thereby establishing the necessity of our conic condition. Finally, we give empirical evidence supporting this theoretical observation, which suggests that the sample based EM algorithm performs poorly when initial guesses are drawn accordingly. Our simulation study also suggests that the EM algorithm performs well even under model misspecification (i.e., when the covariate and error distributions violate the model assumptions)."}

{"text": "Daytime hypoglycemia should be accurately predicted to achieve normoglycemia and to avoid disastrous situations. Hypoglycemia, an abnormally low blood glucose level, is divided into daytime hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Many studies of hypoglycemia prevention deal with nocturnal hypoglycemia. In this paper, we propose new predictor variables to predict daytime hypoglycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. We apply classification and regression tree (CART) as a prediction method. The independent variables of our prediction model are the rate of decrease from a peak and absolute level of the BG at the decision point. The evaluation results showed that our model was able to detect almost 80% of hypoglycemic events 15 min in advance, which was higher than the existing methods with similar conditions. The proposed method might achieve a real-time prediction as well as can be embedded into BG monitoring device."}
{"text": "Sales forecasting plays a prominent role in business planning and business strategy. The value and importance of advance information is a cornerstone of planning activity, and a well-set forecast goal can guide sale-force more efficiently. In this paper CPU sales forecasting of Intel Corporation, a multinational semiconductor industry, was considered. Past sale, future booking, exchange rates, Gross domestic product (GDP) forecasting, seasonality and other indicators were innovatively incorporated into the quantitative modeling. Benefit from the recent advances in computation power and software development, millions of models built upon multiple regressions, time series analysis, random forest and boosting tree were executed in parallel. The models with smaller validation errors were selected to form the ensemble model. To better capture the distinct characteristics, forecasting models were implemented at lead time and lines of business level. The moving windows validation process automatically selected the models which closely represent current market condition. The weekly cadence forecasting schema allowed the model to response effectively to market fluctuation. Generic variable importance analysis was also developed to increase the model interpretability. Rather than assuming fixed distribution, this non-parametric permutation variable importance analysis provided a general framework across methods to evaluate the variable importance. This variable importance framework can further extend to classification problem by modifying the mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) into misclassify error.

{"text": "As the emergence and the thriving development of social networks, a huge number of short texts are accumulated and need to be processed. Inferring latent topics of collected short texts is useful for understanding its hidden structure and predicting new contents. Unlike conventional topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a biterm topic model (BTM) was recently proposed for short texts to overcome the sparseness of document-level word co-occurrences by directly modeling the generation process of word pairs. Stochastic inference algorithms based on collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) and collapsed variational inference have been proposed for BTM. However, they either require large computational complexity, or rely on very crude estimation. In this work, we develop a stochastic divergence minimization inference algorithm for BTM to estimate latent topics more accurately in a scalable way. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared with existing inference algorithms."}
{"text": "The paper addresses the simultneous determination of goup-sparse loadings by block optimization, and the correlated problem of defining explained variance for a set of non orthogonal components. We give in both cases a comprehensive mathematical presentation of the problem, which leads to propose i) a new formulation/algorithm for group-sparse block PCA and ii) a framework for the definition of explained variance with the analysis of five definitions. The numerical results i) confirm the superiority of block optimization over deflation for the determination of group-sparse loadings, and the importance of group information when available, and ii) show that ranking of algorithms according to explained variance is essentially independant of the definition of explained variance. These results lead to propose a new optimal variance as the definition of choice for explained variance."}
{"text": "Consider two networks on overlapping, non-identical vertex sets. Given vertices of interest in the first network, we seek to identify the corresponding vertices, if any exist, in the second network. While in moderately sized networks graph matching methods can be applied directly to recover the missing correspondences, herein we present a principled methodology appropriate for situations in which the networks are too large for brute-force graph matching. Our methodology identifies vertices in a local neighborhood of the vertices of interest in the first network that have verifiable corresponding vertices in the second network. Leveraging these known correspondences, referred to as seeds, we match the induced subgraphs in each network generated by the neighborhoods of these verified seeds, and rank the vertices of the second network in terms of the most likely matches to the original vertices of interest. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology through simulations and real data examples."}
{"text": "We consider a class of misspecified dynamical models where the governing term is only approximately known. Under the assumption that observations of the system's evolution are accessible for various initial conditions, our goal is to infer a non-parametric correction to the misspecified driving term such as to faithfully represent the system dynamics and devise system evolution predictions for unobserved initial conditions.   We model the unknown correction term as a Gaussian Process and analyze the problem of efficient experimental design to find an optimal correction term under constraints such as a limited experimental budget. We suggest a novel formulation for experimental design for this Gaussian Process and show that approximately optimal (up to a constant factor) designs may be efficiently derived by utilizing results from the literature on submodular optimization. Our numerical experiments exemplify the effectiveness of these techniques."}
{"text": "This paper aims at formulating the issue of ranking multivariate unlabeled observations depending on their degree of abnormality as an unsupervised statistical learning task. In the 1-d situation, this problem is usually tackled by means of tail estimation techniques: univariate observations are viewed as all the more `abnormal' as they are located far in the tail(s) of the underlying probability distribution. It would be desirable as well to dispose of a scalar valued `scoring' function allowing for comparing the degree of abnormality of multivariate observations. Here we formulate the issue of scoring anomalies as a M-estimation problem by means of a novel functional performance criterion, referred to as the Mass Volume curve (MV curve in short), whose optimal elements are strictly increasing transforms of the density almost everywhere on the support of the density. We first study the statistical estimation of the MV curve of a given scoring function and we provide a strategy to build confidence regions using a smoothed bootstrap approach. Optimization of this functional criterion over the set of piecewise constant scoring functions is next tackled. This boils down to estimating a sequence of empirical minimum volume sets whose levels are chosen adaptively from the data, so as to adjust to the variations of the optimal MV curve, while controling the bias of its approximation by a stepwise curve. Generalization bounds are then established for the difference in sup norm between the MV curve of the empirical scoring function thus obtained and the optimal MV curve."}
{"text": "Is it possible to perform linear regression on datasets whose labels are shuffled with respect to the inputs? We explore this question by proposing several estimators that recover the weights of a noisy linear model from labels that are shuffled by an unknown permutation. We show that the analog of the classical least-squares estimator produces inconsistent estimates in this setting, and introduce an estimator based on the self-moments of the input features and labels. We study the regimes in which each estimator excels, and generalize the estimators to the setting where partial ordering information is available in the form of experiments replicated independently. The result is a framework that enables robust inference, as we demonstrate by experiments on both synthetic and standard datasets, where we are able to recover approximate weights using only shuffled labels. Our work demonstrates that linear regression in the absence of complete ordering information is possible and can be of practical interest, particularly in experiments that characterize populations of particles, such as flow cytometry."}
{"text": "We present semiparametric spectral modeling of the complete larval Drosophila mushroom body connectome. Motivated by a thorough exploratory data analysis of the network via Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) in the adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) representation space, we introduce the latent structure model (LSM) for network modeling and inference. LSM is a generalization of the stochastic block model (SBM) and a special case of the random dot product graph (RDPG) latent position model, and is amenable to semiparametric GMM in the ASE representation space. The resulting connectome code derived via semiparametric GMM composed with ASE captures latent connectome structure and elucidates biologically relevant neuronal properties."}
{"text": "A semi-parametric, non-linear regression model in the presence of latent variables is introduced. These latent variables can correspond to unmodeled phenomena or unmeasured agents in a complex networked system. This new formulation allows joint estimation of certain non-linearities in the system, the direct interactions between measured variables, and the effects of unmodeled elements on the observed system. The particular form of the model adopted is justified, and learning is posed as a regularized empirical risk minimization. This leads to classes of structured convex optimization problems with a \"sparse plus low-rank\" flavor. Relations between the proposed model and several common model paradigms, such as those of Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Vector Autoregression (VAR), are established. Particularly in the VAR setting, the low-rank contributions can come from broad trends exhibited in the time series. Details of the algorithm for learning the model are presented. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the model and the estimation algorithm on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "Many unsupervised kernel methods rely on the estimation of the kernel covariance operator (kernel CO) or kernel cross-covariance operator (kernel CCO). Both kernel CO and kernel CCO are sensitive to contaminated data, even when bounded positive definite kernels are used. To the best of our knowledge, there are few well-founded robust kernel methods for statistical unsupervised learning. In addition, while the influence function (IF) of an estimator can characterize its robustness, asymptotic properties and standard error, the IF of a standard kernel canonical correlation analysis (standard kernel CCA) has not been derived yet. To fill this gap, we first propose a robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and a robust kernel cross-covariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we derive the IF for robust kernel CCO and standard kernel CCA. Using the IF of the standard kernel CCA, we can detect influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method based on the robust kernel CO and the robust kernel CCO, called {\\bf robust kernel CCA}, which is less sensitive to noise than the standard kernel CCA. The introduced principles can also be applied to many other kernel methods involving kernel CO or kernel CCO. Our experiments on synthesized data and imaging genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed IF of standard kernel CCA can identify outliers. It is also seen that the proposed robust kernel CCA method performs better for ideal and contaminated data than the standard kernel CCA."}
{"text": "In healthcare applications, temporal variables that encode movement, health status and longitudinal patient evolution are often accompanied by rich structured information such as demographics, diagnostics and medical exam data. However, current methods do not jointly optimize over structured covariates and time series in the feature extraction process. We present ShortFuse, a method that boosts the accuracy of deep learning models for time series by explicitly modeling temporal interactions and dependencies with structured covariates. ShortFuse introduces hybrid convolutional and LSTM cells that incorporate the covariates via weights that are shared across the temporal domain. ShortFuse outperforms competing models by 3% on two biomedical applications, forecasting osteoarthritis-related cartilage degeneration and predicting surgical outcomes for cerebral palsy patients, matching or exceeding the accuracy of models that use features engineered by domain experts."}
{"text": "Sparse mapping has been a key methodology in many high-dimensional scientific problems. When multiple tasks share the set of relevant features, learning them jointly in a group drastically improves the quality of relevant feature selection. However, in practice this technique is used limitedly since such grouping information is usually hidden. In this paper, our goal is to recover the group structure on the sparsity patterns and leverage that information in the sparse learning. Toward this, we formulate a joint optimization problem in the task parameter and the group membership, by constructing an appropriate regularizer to encourage sparse learning as well as correct recovery of task groups. We further demonstrate that our proposed method recovers groups and the sparsity patterns in the task parameters accurately by extensive experiments."}
{"text": "We propose a set of convex low rank inducing norms for a coupled matrices and tensors (hereafter coupled tensors), which shares information between matrices and tensors through common modes. More specifically, we propose a mixture of the overlapped trace norm and the latent norms with the matrix trace norm, and then, we propose a new completion algorithm based on the proposed norms. A key advantage of the proposed norms is that it is convex and can find a globally optimal solution, while existing methods for coupled learning are non-convex. Furthermore, we analyze the excess risk bounds of the completion model regularized by our proposed norms which show that our proposed norms can exploit the low rankness of coupled tensors leading to better bounds compared to uncoupled norms. Through synthetic and real-world data experiments, we show that the proposed completion algorithm compares favorably with existing completion algorithms."}

{"text": "In order to achieve state-of-the-art performance, modern machine learning techniques require careful data pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, given the ever increasing number of machine learning models being developed, model selection is becoming increasingly important. Automating the selection and tuning of machine learning pipelines consisting of data pre-processing methods and machine learning models, has long been one of the goals of the machine learning community. In this paper, we tackle this meta-learning task by combining ideas from collaborative filtering and Bayesian optimization. Using probabilistic matrix factorization techniques and acquisition functions from Bayesian optimization, we exploit experiments performed in hundreds of different datasets to guide the exploration of the space of possible pipelines. In our experiments, we show that our approach quickly identifies high-performing pipelines across a wide range of datasets, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "Kernel methods are popular in clustering due to their generality and discriminating power. However, we show that many kernel clustering criteria have density biases theoretically explaining some practically significant artifacts empirically observed in the past. For example, we provide conditions and formally prove the density mode isolation bias in kernel K-means for a common class of kernels. We call it Breiman's bias due to its similarity to the histogram mode isolation previously discovered by Breiman in decision tree learning with Gini impurity. We also extend our analysis to other popular kernel clustering methods, e.g. average/normalized cut or dominant sets, where density biases can take different forms. For example, splitting isolated points by cut-based criteria is essentially the sparsest subset bias, which is the opposite of the density mode bias. Our findings suggest that a principled solution for density biases in kernel clustering should directly address data inhomogeneity. We show that density equalization can be implicitly achieved using either locally adaptive weights or locally adaptive kernels. Moreover, density equalization makes many popular kernel clustering objectives equivalent. Our synthetic and real data experiments illustrate density biases and proposed solutions. We anticipate that theoretical understanding of kernel clustering limitations and their principled solutions will be important for a broad spectrum of data analysis applications across the disciplines."}
{"text": "In this paper, we present a novel method for co-clustering, an unsupervised learning approach that aims at discovering homogeneous groups of data instances and features by grouping them simultaneously. The proposed method uses the entropy regularized optimal transport between empirical measures defined on data instances and features in order to obtain an estimated joint probability density function represented by the optimal coupling matrix. This matrix is further factorized to obtain the induced row and columns partitions using multiscale representations approach. To justify our method theoretically, we show how the solution of the regularized optimal transport can be seen from the variational inference perspective thus motivating its use for co-clustering. The algorithm derived for the proposed method and its kernelized version based on the notion of Gromov-Wasserstein distance are fast, accurate and can determine automatically the number of both row and column clusters. These features are vividly demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations."}
{"text": "We develop a new method called Discriminated Hub Graphical Lasso (DHGL) based on Hub Graphical Lasso (HGL) by providing prior information of hubs. We apply this new method in two situations: with known hubs and without known hubs. Then we compare DHGL with HGL using several measures of performance. When some hubs are known, we can always estimate the precision matrix better via DHGL than HGL. When no hubs are known, we use Graphical Lasso (GL) to provide information of hubs and find that the performance of DHGL will always be better than HGL if correct prior information is given and will seldom degenerate when the prior information is wrong."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of efficient randomized dimensionality reduction with norm-preservation guarantees. Specifically we prove data-dependent Johnson-Lindenstrauss-type geometry preservation guarantees for Ho's random subspace method: When data satisfy a mild regularity condition -- the extent of which can be estimated by sampling from the data -- then random subspace approximately preserves the Euclidean geometry of the data with high probability. Our guarantees are of the same order as those for random projection, namely the required dimension for projection is logarithmic in the number of data points, but have a larger constant term in the bound which depends upon this regularity. A challenging situation is when the original data have a sparse representation, since this implies a very large projection dimension is required: We show how this situation can be improved for sparse binary data by applying an efficient `densifying' preprocessing, which neither changes the Euclidean geometry of the data nor requires an explicit matrix-matrix multiplication. We corroborate our theoretical findings with experiments on both dense and sparse high-dimensional datasets from several application domains."}
{"text": "Analyzing the underlying structure of multiple time-sequences provides insights into the understanding of social networks and human activities. In this work, we present the \\emph{Bayesian nonparametric Poisson process allocation} (BaNPPA), a latent-function model for time-sequences, which automatically infers the number of latent functions. We model the intensity of each sequence as an infinite mixture of latent functions, each of which is obtained using a function drawn from a Gaussian process. We show that a technical challenge for the inference of such mixture models is the unidentifiability of the weights of the latent functions. We propose to cope with the issue by regulating the volume of each latent function within a variational inference algorithm. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and scales well to large data sets. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed model through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets."}
{"text": "Gradient matching is a promising tool for learning parameters and state dynamics of ordinary differential equations. It is a grid free inference approach, which, for fully observable systems is at times competitive with numerical integration. However, for many real-world applications, only sparse observations are available or even unobserved variables are included in the model description. In these cases most gradient matching methods are difficult to apply or simply do not provide satisfactory results. That is why, despite the high computational cost, numerical integration is still the gold standard in many applications. Using an existing gradient matching approach, we propose a scalable variational inference framework which can infer states and parameters simultaneously, offers computational speedups, improved accuracy and works well even under model misspecifications in a partially observable system."}
{"text": "This paper introduces the kernel mixture network, a new method for nonparametric estimation of conditional probability densities using neural networks. We model arbitrarily complex conditional densities as linear combinations of a family of kernel functions centered at a subset of training points. The weights are determined by the outer layer of a deep neural network, trained by minimizing the negative log likelihood. This generalizes the popular quantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with square and non-overlapping kernels. We test the performance of our method on two important applications, namely Bayesian filtering and generative modeling. In the Bayesian filtering example, we show that the method can be used to filter complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals defined on manifolds. The resulting kernel mixture network filter outperforms both the quantized softmax filter and the extended Kalman filter in terms of model likelihood. Finally, our experiments on generative models show that, given the same architecture, the kernel mixture network leads to higher test set likelihood, less overfitting and more diversified and realistic generated samples than the quantized softmax approach."}
{"text": "Sparse pseudo-point approximations for Gaussian process (GP) models provide a suite of methods that support deployment of GPs in the large data regime and enable analytic intractabilities to be sidestepped. However, the field lacks a principled method to handle streaming data in which both the posterior distribution over function values and the hyperparameter estimates are updated in an online fashion. The small number of existing approaches either use suboptimal hand-crafted heuristics for hyperparameter learning, or suffer from catastrophic forgetting or slow updating when new data arrive. This paper develops a new principled framework for deploying Gaussian process probabilistic models in the streaming setting, providing methods for learning hyperparameters and optimising pseudo-input locations. The proposed framework is assessed using synthetic and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "Recently, (Blanchet, Kang, and Murhy 2016, and Blanchet, and Kang 2017) showed that several machine learning algorithms, such as square-root Lasso, Support Vector Machines, and regularized logistic regression, among many others, can be represented exactly as distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems. The distributional uncertainty is defined as a neighborhood centered at the empirical distribution. We propose a methodology which learns such neighborhood in a natural data-driven way. We show rigorously that our framework encompasses adaptive regularization as a particular case. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that our proposed methodology is able to improve upon a wide range of popular machine learning estimators."}
{"text": "Data-driven Distributionally Robust Optimization (DD-DRO) via optimal transport has been shown to encompass a wide range of popular machine learning algorithms. The distributional uncertainty size is often shown to correspond to the regularization parameter. The type of regularization (e.g. the norm used to regularize) corresponds to the shape of the distributional uncertainty. We propose a data-driven robust optimization methodology to inform the transportation cost underlying the definition of the distributional uncertainty. We show empirically that this additional layer of robustification, which produces a method we called doubly robust data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DD-R-DRO), allows to enhance the generalization properties of regularized estimators while reducing testing error relative to state-of-the-art classifiers in a wide range of data sets."}
{"text": "Inference of latent feature models in the Bayesian nonparametric setting is generally difficult, especially in high dimensional settings, because it usually requires proposing features from some prior distribution. In special cases, where the integration is tractable, we could sample new feature assignments according to a predictive likelihood. However, this still may not be efficient in high dimensions. We present a novel method to accelerate the mixing of latent variable model inference by proposing feature locations from the data, as opposed to the prior. First, we introduce our accelerated feature proposal mechanism that we will show is a valid Bayesian inference algorithm and next we propose an approximate inference strategy to perform accelerated inference in parallel. This sampling method is efficient for proper mixing of the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, computationally attractive, and is theoretically guaranteed to converge to the posterior distribution as its limiting distribution."}
{"text": "The present work deals with active sampling of graph nodes representing training data for binary classification. The graph may be given or constructed using similarity measures among nodal features. Leveraging the graph for classification builds on the premise that labels across neighboring nodes are correlated according to a categorical Markov random field (MRF). This model is further relaxed to a Gaussian (G)MRF with labels taking continuous values - an approximation that not only mitigates the combinatorial complexity of the categorical model, but also offers optimal unbiased soft predictors of the unlabeled nodes. The proposed sampling strategy is based on querying the node whose label disclosure is expected to inflict the largest change on the GMRF, and in this sense it is the most informative on average. Such a strategy subsumes several measures of expected model change, including uncertainty sampling, variance minimization, and sampling based on the $\\Sigma-$optimality criterion. A simple yet effective heuristic is also introduced for increasing the exploration capabilities of the sampler, and reducing bias of the resultant classifier, by taking into account the confidence on the model label predictions. The novel sampling strategies are based on quantities that are readily available without the need for model retraining, rendering them computationally efficient and scalable to large graphs. Numerical tests using synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve accuracy that is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art even at reduced runtime."}
{"text": "Dropout-based regularization methods can be regarded as injecting random noise with pre-defined magnitude to different parts of the neural network during training. It was recently shown that Bayesian dropout procedure not only improves generalization but also leads to extremely sparse neural architectures by automatically setting the individual noise magnitude per weight. However, this sparsity can hardly be used for acceleration since it is unstructured. In the paper, we propose a new Bayesian model that takes into account the computational structure of neural networks and provides structured sparsity, e.g. removes neurons and/or convolutional channels in CNNs. To do this we inject noise to the neurons outputs while keeping the weights unregularized. We establish the probabilistic model with a proper truncated log-uniform prior over the noise and truncated log-normal variational approximation that ensures that the KL-term in the evidence lower bound is computed in closed-form. The model leads to structured sparsity by removing elements with a low SNR from the computation graph and provides significant acceleration on a number of deep neural architectures. The model is easy to implement as it can be formulated as a separate dropout-like layer."}

Our new algorithm improves upon HDBSCAN*, which itself provided a significant qualitative improvement over the popular DBSCAN algorithm. The accelerated HDBSCAN* algorithm provides comparable performance to DBSCAN, while supporting variable density clusters, and eliminating the need for the difficult to tune distance scale parameter.

{"text": "In high-dimensional classification settings, we wish to seek a balance between high power and ensuring control over a desired loss function. In many settings, the points most likely to be misclassified are those who lie near the decision boundary of the given classification method. Often, these uninformative points should not be classified as they are noisy and do not exhibit strong signals. In this paper, we introduce the Thresholding Method to parameterize the problem of determining which points exhibit strong signals and should be classified. We demonstrate the empirical performance of this novel calibration method in providing loss function control at a desired level, as well as explore how the method assuages the effect of overfitting. We explore the benefits of error control through the Thresholding Method in difficult, high-dimensional, simulated settings. Finally, we show the flexibility of the Thresholding Method through applying the method in a variety of real data settings."}
{"text": "The waggle dance that honeybees perform is an astonishing way of communicating the location of food source. After over 60 years of its discovery, researchers still use manual labeling by watching hours of dance videos to detect different transitions between dance components thus extracting information regarding the distance and direction to the food source. We propose an automated process to monitor and segment different components of honeybee waggle dance. The process is highly accurate, runs in real-time, and can use shared information between multiple dances."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimation of a low-rank matrix from a limited number of noisy rank-one projections. In particular, we propose two fast, non-convex \\emph{proper} algorithms for matrix recovery and support them with rigorous theoretical analysis. We show that the proposed algorithms enjoy linear convergence and that their sample complexity is independent of the condition number of the unknown true low-rank matrix. By leveraging recent advances in low-rank matrix approximation techniques, we show that our algorithms achieve computational speed-ups over existing methods. Finally, we complement our theory with some numerical experiments."}
{"text": "The increasing size and complexity of scientific data could dramatically enhance discovery and prediction for basic scientific applications. Realizing this potential, however, requires novel statistical analysis methods that are both interpretable and predictive. We introduce Union of Intersections (UoI), a flexible, modular, and scalable framework for enhanced model selection and estimation. Methods based on UoI perform model selection and model estimation through intersection and union operations, respectively. We show that UoI-based methods achieve low-variance and nearly unbiased estimation of a small number of interpretable features, while maintaining high-quality prediction accuracy. We perform extensive numerical investigation to evaluate a UoI algorithm ($UoI_{Lasso}$) on synthetic and real data. In doing so, we demonstrate the extraction of interpretable functional networks from human electrophysiology recordings as well as accurate prediction of phenotypes from genotype-phenotype data with reduced features. We also show (with the $UoI_{L1Logistic}$ and $UoI_{CUR}$ variants of the basic framework) improved prediction parsimony for classification and matrix factorization on several benchmark biomedical data sets. These results suggest that methods based on the UoI framework could improve interpretation and prediction in data-driven discovery across scientific fields."}
{"text": "Identifying a set of homogeneous clusters in a heterogeneous dataset is one of the most important classes of problems in statistical modeling. In the realm of unsupervised partitional clustering, k-means is a very important algorithm for this. In this technical report, we develop a new k-means variant called Augmented k-means, which is a hybrid of k-means and logistic regression. During each iteration, logistic regression is used to predict the current cluster labels, and the cluster belonging probabilities are used to control the subsequent re-estimation of cluster means. Observations which can't be firmly identified into clusters are excluded from the re-estimation step. This can be valuable when the data exhibit many characteristics of real datasets such as heterogeneity, non-sphericity, substantial overlap, and high scatter. Augmented k-means frequently outperforms k-means by more accurately classifying observations into known clusters and / or converging in fewer iterations. We demonstrate this on both simulated and real datasets. Our algorithm is implemented in Python and will be available with this report."}
{"text": "Actor-critic methods solve reinforcement learning problems by updating a parameterized policy known as an actor in a direction that increases an estimate of the expected return known as a critic. However, existing actor-critic methods only use values or gradients of the critic to update the policy parameter. In this paper, we propose a novel actor-critic method called the guide actor-critic (GAC). GAC firstly learns a guide actor that locally maximizes the critic and then it updates the policy parameter based on the guide actor by supervised learning. Our main theoretical contributions are two folds. First, we show that GAC updates the guide actor by performing second-order optimization in the action space where the curvature matrix is based on the Hessians of the critic. Second, we show that the deterministic policy gradient method is a special case of GAC when the Hessians are ignored. Through experiments, we show that our method is a promising reinforcement learning method for continuous controls."}
{"text": "We study unsupervised generative modeling in terms of the optimal transport (OT) problem between true (but unknown) data distribution $P_X$ and the latent variable model distribution $P_G$. We show that the OT problem can be equivalently written in terms of probabilistic encoders, which are constrained to match the posterior and prior distributions over the latent space. When relaxed, this constrained optimization problem leads to a penalized optimal transport (POT) objective, which can be efficiently minimized using stochastic gradient descent by sampling from $P_X$ and $P_G$. We show that POT for the 2-Wasserstein distance coincides with the objective heuristically employed in adversarial auto-encoders (AAE) (Makhzani et al., 2016), which provides the first theoretical justification for AAEs known to the authors. We also compare POT to other popular techniques like variational auto-encoders (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2014). Our theoretical results include (a) a better understanding of the commonly observed blurriness of images generated by VAEs, and (b) establishing duality between Wasserstein GAN (Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017) and POT for the 1-Wasserstein distance."}
{"text": "Various problems in data analysis and statistical genetics call for recovery of a column-sparse, low-rank matrix from noisy observations. We propose ReFACTor, a simple variation of the classical Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) algorithm. In contrast to previous sparse principal component analysis (PCA) algorithms, our algorithm can provably reveal a low-rank signal matrix better, and often significantly better, than the widely used TSVD, making it the algorithm of choice whenever column-sparsity is suspected. Empirically, we observe that ReFACTor consistently outperforms TSVD even when the underlying signal is not sparse, suggesting that it is generally safe to use ReFACTor instead of TSVD and PCA. The algorithm is extremely simple to implement and its running time is dominated by the runtime of PCA, making it as practical as standard principal component analysis."}
{"text": "In many distributed learning problems, the heterogeneous loading of computing machines may harm the overall performance of synchronous strategies. In this paper, we propose an effective asynchronous distributed framework for the minimization of a sum of smooth functions, where each machine performs iterations in parallel on its local function and updates a shared parameter asynchronously. In this way, all machines can continuously work even though they do not have the latest version of the shared parameter. We prove the convergence of the consistency of this general distributed asynchronous method for gradient iterations then show its efficiency on the matrix factorization problem for recommender systems and on binary classification."}
{"text": "Deep generative models provide powerful tools for distributions over complicated manifolds, such as those of natural images. But many of these methods, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), can be difficult to train, in part because they are prone to mode collapse, which means that they characterize only a few modes of the true distribution. To address this, we introduce VEEGAN, which features a reconstructor network, reversing the action of the generator by mapping from data to noise. Our training objective retains the original asymptotic consistency guarantee of GANs, and can be interpreted as a novel autoencoder loss over the noise. In sharp contrast to a traditional autoencoder over data points, VEEGAN does not require specifying a loss function over the data, but rather only over the representations, which are standard normal by assumption. On an extensive set of synthetic and real world image datasets, VEEGAN indeed resists mode collapsing to a far greater extent than other recent GAN variants, and produces more realistic samples."}
{"text": "Dropout is used as a practical tool to obtain uncertainty estimates in large vision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, a grid-search over the dropout probabilities is necessary - a prohibitive operation with large models, and an impossible one with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved performance and better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments in Bayesian deep learning, we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete masks. Together with a principled optimisation objective, this allows for automatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models, and as a result faster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as more data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant extensively on a range of tasks, and give insights into common practice in the field where larger dropout probabilities are often used in deeper model layers."}
{"text": "In this work we develop a fast saliency detection method that can be applied to any differentiable image classifier. We train a masking model to manipulate the scores of the classifier by masking salient parts of the input image. Our model generalises well to unseen images and requires a single forward pass to perform saliency detection, therefore suitable for use in real-time systems. We test our approach on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and show that the produced saliency maps are easily interpretable, sharp, and free of artifacts. We suggest a new metric for saliency and test our method on the ImageNet object localisation task. We achieve results outperforming other weakly supervised methods."}

{"text": "Traditionally, community detection in graphs can be solved using spectral methods or posterior inference under probabilistic graphical models. Focusing on random graph families such as the stochastic block model, recent research has unified both approaches and identified both statistical and computational detection thresholds in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. By recasting community detection as a node-wise classification problem on graphs, we can also study it from a learning perspective. We present a novel family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for solving community detection problems in a supervised learning setting. We show that, in a data-driven manner and without access to the underlying generative models, they can match or even surpass the performance of the belief propagation algorithm on binary and multi-class stochastic block models, which is believed to reach the computational threshold. In particular, we propose to augment GNNs with the non-backtracking operator defined on the line graph of edge adjacencies. Our models also achieve good performance on real-world datasets. In addition, we perform the first analysis of the optimization landscape of training linear GNNs for community detection problems, demonstrating that under certain simplifications and assumptions, the loss values at local and global minima are not far apart."}
{"text": "The volume of data generated by internet and social networks is increasing every day, and there is a clear need for efficient ways of extracting useful information from them. As those data can take different forms, it is important to use all the available data representations for prediction.   In this paper, we focus our attention on supervised classification using both regular plain, tabular, data and structural information coming from a network structure. 14 techniques are investigated and compared in this study and can be divided in three classes: the first one uses only the plain data to build a classification model, the second uses only the graph structure and the last uses both information sources. The relative performances in these three cases are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of using a graph embedding and well-known indicators in spatial statistics is also studied.   Possible applications are automatic classification of web pages or other linked documents, of people in a social network or of proteins in a biological complex system, to name a few.   Based on our comparison, we draw some general conclusions and advices to tackle this particular classification task: some datasets can be better explained by their graph structure (graph-driven), or by their feature set (features-driven). The most efficient methods are discussed in both cases."}
{"text": "We consider parametric exponential families of dimension $K$ on the real line. We study a variant of \\textit{boundary crossing probabilities} coming from the multi-armed bandit literature, in the case when the real-valued distributions form an exponential family of dimension $K$. Formally, our result is a concentration inequality that bounds the probability that $\\mathcal{B}^\\psi(\\hat \\theta_n,\\theta^\\star)\\geq f(t/n)/n$, where $\\theta^\\star$ is the parameter of an unknown target distribution, $\\hat \\theta_n$ is the empirical parameter estimate built from $n$ observations, $\\psi$ is the log-partition function of the exponential family and $\\mathcal{B}^\\psi$ is the corresponding Bregman divergence. From the perspective of stochastic multi-armed bandits, we pay special attention to the case when the boundary function $f$ is logarithmic, as it is enables to analyze the regret of the state-of-the-art \\KLUCB\\ and \\KLUCBp\\ strategies, whose analysis was left open in such generality. Indeed, previous results only hold for the case when $K=1$, while we provide results for arbitrary finite dimension $K$, thus considerably extending the existing results. Perhaps surprisingly, we highlight that the proof techniques to achieve these strong results already existed three decades ago in the work of T.L. Lai, and were apparently forgotten in the bandit community. We provide a modern rewriting of these beautiful techniques that we believe are useful beyond the application to stochastic multi-armed bandits."}
{"text": "Gaussian processes (GPs) are a good choice for function approximation as they are flexible, robust to over-fitting, and provide well-calibrated predictive uncertainty. Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer generalisations of GPs, but inference in these models has proved challenging. Existing approaches to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force independence between the layers, and do not work well in practice. We present a doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm, which does not force independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a billion points. We provide strong empirical evidence that our inference scheme for DGPs works well in practice in both classification and regression."}
{"text": "Exponential family distributions are highly useful in machine learning since their calculation can be performed efficiently through natural parameters. The exponential family has recently been extended to the t-exponential family, which contains Student-t distributions as family members and thus allows us to handle noisy data well. However, since the t-exponential family is denied by the deformed exponential, we cannot derive an efficient learning algorithm for the t-exponential family such as expectation propagation (EP). In this paper, we borrow the mathematical tools of q-algebra from statistical physics and show that the pseudo additivity of distributions allows us to perform calculation of t-exponential family distributions through natural parameters. We then develop an expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for the t-exponential family, which provides a deterministic approximation to the posterior or predictive distribution with simple moment matching. We finally apply the proposed EP algorithm to the Bayes point machine and Student-t process classication, and demonstrate their performance numerically."}
{"text": "Langevin diffusion is a commonly used tool for sampling from a given distribution. In this work, we establish that when the target density $p^*$ is such that $\\log p^*$ is $L$ smooth and $m$ strongly convex, discrete Langevin diffusion produces a distribution $p$ with $KL(p||p^*)\\leq \\epsilon$ in $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{d}{\\epsilon})$ steps, where $d$ is the dimension of the sample space. We also study the convergence rate when the strong-convexity assumption is absent. By considering the Langevin diffusion as a gradient flow in the space of probability distributions, we obtain an elegant analysis that applies to the stronger property of convergence in KL-divergence and gives a conceptually simpler proof of the best-known convergence results in weaker metrics."}
{"text": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a widely popular framework for generative modelling of high-dimensional datasets. However their training is well-known to be difficult. This work presents a rigorous statistical analysis of GANs providing straight-forward explanations for common training pathologies such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, it proposes a new training objective, Kernel GANs, and demonstrates its practical effectiveness on large-scale real-world data sets. A key element in the analysis is the distinction between training with respect to the (unknown) data distribution, and its empirical counterpart. To overcome issues in GAN training, we pursue the idea of smoothing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) by incorporating noise in the input distributions of the discriminator. As we show, this effectively leads to an empirical version of the JSD in which the true and the generator densities are replaced by kernel density estimates, which leads to Kernel GANs."}
{"text": "We present a new model, Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks (PSRNNs), for filtering and prediction in dynamical systems. PSRNNs draw on insights from both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Predictive State Representations (PSRs), and inherit advantages from both types of models. Like many successful RNN architectures, PSRNNs use (potentially deeply composed) bilinear transfer functions to combine information from multiple sources. We show that such bilinear functions arise naturally from state updates in Bayes filters like PSRs, in which observations can be viewed as gating belief states. We also show that PSRNNs can be learned effectively by combining Backpropogation Through Time (BPTT) with an initialization derived from a statistically consistent learning algorithm for PSRs called two-stage regression (2SR). Finally, we show that PSRNNs can be factorized using tensor decomposition, reducing model size and suggesting interesting connections to existing multiplicative architectures such as LSTMs. We applied PSRNNs to 4 datasets, and showed that we outperform several popular alternative approaches to modeling dynamical systems in all cases."}
{"text": "Deep learning applies hierarchical layers of hidden variables to construct nonlinear high dimensional predictors. Our goal is to develop and train deep learning architectures for spatio-temporal modeling. Training a deep architecture is achieved by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and drop-out (DO) for parameter regularization with a goal of minimizing out-of-sample predictive mean squared error. To illustrate our methodology, we predict the sharp discontinuities in traffic flow data, and secondly, we develop a classification rule to predict short-term futures market prices as a function of the order book depth. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research."}
{"text": "We build on auto-encoding sequential Monte Carlo (AESMC): a method for model and proposal learning based on maximizing the lower bound to the log marginal likelihood in a broad family of structured probabilistic models. Our approach relies on the efficiency of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for performing inference in structured probabilistic models and the flexibility of deep neural networks to model complex conditional probability distributions. We develop additional theoretical insights and introduce a new training procedure which improves both model and proposal learning. We demonstrate that our approach provides a fast, easy-to-implement and scalable means for simultaneous model learning and proposal adaptation in deep generative models."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider the problem of fair statistical inference involving outcome variables. Examples include classification and regression problems, and estimating treatment effects in randomized trials or observational data. The issue of fairness arises in such problems where some covariates or treatments are \"sensitive,\" in the sense of having potential of creating discrimination. In this paper, we argue that the presence of discrimination can be formalized in a sensible way as the presence of an effect of a sensitive covariate on the outcome along certain causal pathways, a view which generalizes (Pearl, 2009). A fair outcome model can then be learned by solving a constrained optimization problem. We discuss a number of complications that arise in classical statistical inference due to this view and provide workarounds based on recent work in causal and semi-parametric inference."}
{"text": "Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently received increasing attention for their ability to provide well-calibrated posterior uncertainties. However, model selection---even choosing the number of nodes---remains an open question. In this work, we apply a horseshoe prior over node pre-activations of a Bayesian neural network, which effectively turns off nodes that do not help explain the data. We demonstrate that our prior prevents the BNN from under-fitting even when the number of nodes required is grossly over-estimated. Moreover, this model selection over the number of nodes doesn't come at the expense of predictive or computational performance; in fact, we learn smaller networks with comparable predictive performance to current approaches."}
{"text": "Gaussian processes (GPs), or distributions over arbitrary functions in a continuous domain, can be generalized to the multi-output case: a linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is one approach. LMCs estimate and exploit correlations across the multiple outputs. While model estimation can be performed efficiently for single-output GPs, these assume stationarity, but in the multi-output case the cross-covariance interaction is not stationary. We propose Large Linear GP (LLGP), which circumvents the need for stationarity by inducing structure in the LMC kernel through a common grid of inputs shared between outputs, enabling optimization of GP hyperparameters for multi-dimensional outputs and low-dimensional inputs. When applied to synthetic two-dimensional and real time series data, we find our theoretical improvement relative to the current solutions for multi-output GPs is realized with LLGP reducing training time while improving or maintaining predictive mean accuracy. Moreover, by using a direct likelihood approximation rather than a variational one, model confidence estimates are significantly improved."}
{"text": "Numerous social, medical, engineering and biological challenges can be framed as graph-based learning tasks. Here, we propose a new feature based approach to network classification. We show how dynamics on a network can be useful to reveal patterns about the organization of the components of the underlying graph where the process takes place. We define generalized assortativities on networks and use them as generalized features across multiple time scales. These features turn out to be suitable signatures for discriminating between different classes of networks. Our method is evaluated empirically on established network benchmarks. We also introduce a new dataset of human brain networks (connectomes) and use it to evaluate our method. Results reveal that our dynamics based features are competitive and often outperform state of the art accuracies."}
{"text": "The Gaussian process state space model (GPSSM) is a non-linear dynamical system, where unknown transition and/or measurement mappings are described by GPs. Most research in GPSSMs has focussed on the state estimation problem, i.e., computing a posterior of the latent state given the model. However, the key challenge in GPSSMs has not been satisfactorily addressed yet: system identification, i.e., learning the model. To address this challenge, we impose a structured Gaussian variational posterior distribution over the latent states, which is parameterised by a recognition model in the form of a bi-directional recurrent neural network. Inference with this structure allows us to recover a posterior smoothed over sequences of data. We provide a practical algorithm for efficiently computing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using the reparameterisation trick. This further allows for the use of arbitrary kernels within the GPSSM. We demonstrate that the learnt GPSSM can efficiently generate plausible future trajectories of the identified system after only observing a small number of episodes from the true system."}
{"text": "Recent papers have formulated the problem of learning graphs from data as an inverse covariance estimation with graph Laplacian constraints. While such problems are convex, existing methods cannot guarantee that solutions will have specific graph topology properties (e.g., being $k$-partite), which are desirable for some applications. In fact, the problem of learning a graph with given topology properties, e.g., finding the $k$-partite graph that best matches the data, is in general non-convex. In this paper, we develop novel theoretical results that provide performance guarantees for an approach to solve these problems. Our solution decomposes this problem into two sub-problems, for which efficient solutions are known. Specifically, a graph topology inference (GTI) step is employed to select a feasible graph topology, i.e., one having the desired property. Then, a graph weight estimation (GWE) step is performed by solving a generalized graph Laplacian estimation problem, where edges are constrained by the topology found in the GTI step. Our main result is a bound on the error of the GWE step as a function of the error in the GTI step. This error bound indicates that the GTI step should be solved using an algorithm that approximates the similarity matrix by another matrix whose entries have been thresholded to zero to have the desired type of graph topology. The GTI stage can leverage existing methods (e.g., state of the art approaches for graph coloring) which are typically based on minimizing the total weight of removed edges. Since the GWE stage is formulated as an inverse covariance estimation problem with linear constraints, it can be solved using existing convex optimization methods. We demonstrate that our two step approach can achieve good results for both synthetic and texture image data."}
{"text": "Minimizing the empirical risk is a popular training strategy, but for learning tasks where the data may be noisy or heavy-tailed, one may require many observations in order to generalize well. To achieve better performance under less stringent requirements, we introduce a procedure which constructs a robust approximation of the risk gradient for use in an iterative learning routine. Using high-probability bounds on the excess risk of this algorithm, we show that our update does not deviate far from the ideal gradient-based update. Empirical tests using both controlled simulations and real-world benchmark data show that in diverse settings, the proposed procedure can learn more efficiently, using less resources (iterations and observations) while generalizing better."}
{"text": "The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions (i.e. two probability distributions supported on two distinct low-dimensional manifolds living in a much higher-dimensional space) is a crucial problem arising in the estimation of generative models for high-dimensional observations such as those arising in computer vision or natural language. It is known that optimal transport metrics can represent a cure for this problem, since they were specifically designed as an alternative to information divergences to handle such problematic scenarios. Unfortunately, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) the instability and lack of smoothness of these losses, (iii) the difficulty to estimate robustly these losses and their gradients in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable computational method to train large scale generative models using an optimal transport loss, and tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into one that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations. These two approximations result in a robust and differentiable approximation of the OT loss with streamlined GPU execution. Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD which comes with unbiased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function."}
{"text": "We study the problem of detecting change points (CPs) that are characterized by a subset of dimensions in a multi-dimensional sequence. A method for detecting those CPs can be formulated as a two-stage method: one for selecting relevant dimensions, and another for selecting CPs. It has been difficult to properly control the false detection probability of these CP detection methods because selection bias in each stage must be properly corrected. Our main contribution in this paper is to formulate a CP detection problem as a selective inference problem, and show that exact (non-asymptotic) inference is possible for a class of CP detection methods. We demonstrate the performances of the proposed selective inference framework through numerical simulations and its application to our motivating medical data analysis problem."}
{"text": "Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed in Gregor and Le Cun (2010), which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately.   In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails."}

{"text": "Chemical space is so large that brute force searches for new interesting molecules are infeasible. High-throughput virtual screening via computer cluster simulations can speed up the discovery process by collecting very large amounts of data in parallel, e.g., up to hundreds or thousands of parallel measurements. Bayesian optimization (BO) can produce additional acceleration by sequentially identifying the most useful simulations or experiments to be performed next. However, current BO methods cannot scale to the large numbers of parallel measurements and the massive libraries of molecules currently used in high-throughput screening. Here, we propose a scalable solution based on a parallel and distributed implementation of Thompson sampling (PDTS). We show that, in small scale problems, PDTS performs similarly as parallel expected improvement (EI), a batch version of the most widely used BO heuristic. Additionally, in settings where parallel EI does not scale, PDTS outperforms other scalable baselines such as a greedy search, $\\epsilon$-greedy approaches and a random search method. These results show that PDTS is a successful solution for large-scale parallel BO."}
{"text": "Performance of machine learning approaches depends strongly on the choice of misfit penalty, and correct choice of penalty parameters, such as the threshold of the Huber function. These parameters are typically chosen using expert knowledge, cross-validation, or black-box optimization, which are time consuming for large-scale applications. We present a principled, data-driven approach to simultaneously learn the model pa- rameters and the misfit penalty parameters. We discuss theoretical properties of these joint inference problems, and develop algorithms for their solution. We show synthetic examples of automatic parameter tuning for piecewise linear-quadratic (PLQ) penalties, and use the approach to develop a self-tuning robust PCA formulation for background separation."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose a new volume-preserving flow and show that it performs similarly to the linear general normalizing flow. The idea is to enrich a linear Inverse Autoregressive Flow by introducing multiple lower-triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal and combining them using a convex combination. In the experimental studies on MNIST and Histopathology data we show that the proposed approach outperforms other volume-preserving flows and is competitive with current state-of-the-art linear normalizing flow."}
{"text": "We present a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to estimate a robustified regression plane in a linear regression setting, when the observed samples are potentially contaminated with adversarially corrupted outliers. Our approach mitigates the impact of outliers through hedging against a family of distributions on the observed data, some of which assign very low probabilities to the outliers. The set of distributions under consideration are close to the empirical distribution in the sense of the Wasserstein metric. We show that this DRO formulation can be relaxed to a convex optimization problem which encompasses a class of models. By selecting proper norm spaces for the Wasserstein metric, we are able to recover several commonly used regularized regression models. We provide new insights into the regularization term and give guidance on the selection of the regularization coefficient from the standpoint of a confidence region. We establish two types of performance guarantees for the solution to our formulation under mild conditions. One is related to its out-of-sample behavior (prediction bias), and the other concerns the discrepancy between the estimated and true regression planes (estimation bias). Extensive numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach to a host of regression models, in terms of the prediction and estimation accuracies. We also consider the application of our robust learning procedure to outlier detection, and show that our approach achieves a much higher AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) than M-estimation."}

{"text": "Time series analysis is used to understand and predict dynamic processes, including evolving demands in business, weather, markets, and biological rhythms. Exponential smoothing is used in all these domains to obtain simple interpretable models of time series and to forecast future values. Despite its popularity, exponential smoothing fails dramatically in the presence of outliers, large amounts of noise, or when the underlying time series changes.   We propose a flexible model for time series analysis, using exponential smoothing cells for overlapping time windows. The approach can detect and remove outliers, denoise data, fill in missing observations, and provide meaningful forecasts in challenging situations. In contrast to classic exponential smoothing, which solves a nonconvex optimization problem over the smoothing parameters and initial state, the proposed approach requires solving a single structured convex optimization problem. Recent developments in efficient convex optimization of large-scale dynamic models make the approach tractable. We illustrate new capabilities using synthetic examples, and then use the approach to analyze and forecast noisy real-world time series. Code for the approach and experiments is publicly available."}
{"text": "A multiple instance dictionary learning approach, Dictionary Learning using Functions of Multiple Instances (DL-FUMI), is used to perform beat-to-beat heart rate estimation and to characterize heartbeat signatures from ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals collected with a hydraulic bed sensor. DL-FUMI estimates a \"heartbeat concept\" that represents an individual's personal ballistocardiogram heartbeat pattern. DL-FUMI formulates heartbeat detection and heartbeat characterization as a multiple instance learning problem to address the uncertainty inherent in aligning BCG signals with ground truth during training. Experimental results show that the estimated heartbeat concept found by DL-FUMI is an effective heartbeat prototype and achieves superior performance over comparison algorithms."}
{"text": "We present an efficient block-diagonal ap- proximation to the Gauss-Newton matrix for feedforward neural networks. Our result- ing algorithm is competitive against state- of-the-art first order optimisation methods, with sometimes significant improvement in optimisation performance. Unlike first-order methods, for which hyperparameter tuning of the optimisation parameters is often a labo- rious process, our approach can provide good performance even when used with default set- tings. A side result of our work is that for piecewise linear transfer functions, the net- work objective function can have no differ- entiable local maxima, which may partially explain why such transfer functions facilitate effective optimisation."}
{"text": "Bayesian optimization (BO) methods are useful for optimizing functions that are expensive to evaluate, lack an analytical expression and whose evaluations can be contaminated by noise. These methods rely on a probabilistic model of the objective function, typically a Gaussian process (GP), upon which an acquisition function is built. This function guides the optimization process and measures the expected utility of performing an evaluation of the objective at a new point. GPs assume continous input variables. When this is not the case, such as when some of the input variables take integer values, one has to introduce extra approximations. A common approach is to round the suggested variable value to the closest integer before doing the evaluation of the objective. We show that this can lead to problems in the optimization process and describe a more principled approach to account for input variables that are integer-valued. We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the utility of our approach, which significantly improves the results of standard BO methods on problems involving integer-valued variables."}
{"text": "Latent feature modeling allows capturing the latent structure responsible for generating the observed properties of a set of objects. It is often used to make predictions either for new values of interest or missing information in the original data, as well as to perform data exploratory analysis. However, although there is an extensive literature on latent feature models for homogeneous datasets, where all the attributes that describe each object are of the same (continuous or discrete) nature, there is a lack of work on latent feature modeling for heterogeneous databases. In this paper, we introduce a general Bayesian nonparametric latent feature model suitable for heterogeneous datasets, where the attributes describing each object can be either discrete, continuous or mixed variables. The proposed model presents several important properties. First, it accounts for heterogeneous data while keeping the properties of conjugate models, which allow us to infer the model in linear time with respect to the number of objects and attributes. Second, its Bayesian nonparametric nature allows us to automatically infer the model complexity from the data, i.e., the number of features necessary to capture the latent structure in the data. Third, the latent features in the model are binary-valued variables, easing the interpretability of the obtained latent features in data exploratory analysis. We show the flexibility of the proposed model by solving both prediction and data analysis tasks on several real-world datasets. Moreover, a software package of the GLFM is publicly available for other researcher to use and improve it."}
{"text": "Stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) algorithms have proven useful in scaling Bayesian inference to large datasets under an assumption of i.i.d data. We instead develop an SG-MCMC algorithm to learn the parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for time-dependent data. There are two challenges to applying SG-MCMC in this setting: The latent discrete states, and needing to break dependencies when considering minibatches. We consider a marginal likelihood representation of the HMM and propose an algorithm that harnesses the inherent memory decay of the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic experiments and an ion channel recording data, with runtimes significantly outperforming batch MCMC."}
{"text": "We present a probabilistic framework for overlapping community discovery and link prediction for relational data, given as a graph. The proposed framework has: (1) a deep architecture which enables us to infer multiple layers of latent features/communities for each node, providing superior link prediction performance on more complex networks and better interpretability of the latent features; and (2) a regression model which allows directly conditioning the node latent features on the side information available in form of node attributes. Our framework handles both (1) and (2) via a clean, unified model, which enjoys full local conjugacy via data augmentation, and facilitates efficient inference via closed form Gibbs sampling. Moreover, inference cost scales in the number of edges which is attractive for massive but sparse networks. Our framework is also easily extendable to model weighted networks with count-valued edges. We compare with various state-of-the-art methods and report results, both quantitative and qualitative, on several benchmark data sets."}
{"text": "The two-sample hypothesis testing problem is studied for the challenging scenario of high dimensional data sets with small sample sizes. We show that the two-sample hypothesis testing problem can be posed as a one-class set classification problem. In the set classification problem the goal is to classify a set of data points that are assumed to have a common class. We prove that the average probability of error given a set is less than or equal to the Bayes error and decreases as a power of $n$ number of sample data points in the set. We use the positive definite Set Kernel for directly mapping sets of data to an associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, without the need to learn a probability distribution. We specifically solve the two-sample hypothesis testing problem using a one-class SVM in conjunction with the proposed Set Kernel. We compare the proposed method with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy, F-Test and T-Test methods on a number of challenging simulated high dimensional and small sample size data. We also perform two-sample hypothesis testing experiments on six cancer gene expression data sets and achieve zero type-I and type-II error results on all data sets."}
{"text": "The infinitesimal jackknife (IJ) has recently been applied to the random forest to estimate its prediction variance. These theorems were verified under a traditional random forest framework which uses classification and regression trees (CART) and bootstrap resampling. However, random forests using conditional inference (CI) trees and subsampling have been found to be not prone to variable selection bias. Here, we conduct simulation experiments using a novel approach to explore the applicability of the IJ to random forests using variations on the resampling method and base learner. Test data points were simulated and each trained using random forest on one hundred simulated training data sets using different combinations of resampling and base learners. Using CI trees instead of traditional CART trees as well as using subsampling instead of bootstrap sampling resulted in a much more accurate estimation of prediction variance when using the IJ. The random forest variations here have been incorporated into an open source software package for the R programming language."}
{"text": "We propose a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for prediction- and information extraction tasks with an efficient inference scheme. It models categorical-valued time series that exhibit dynamics from multiple underlying patterns (e.g. user behavior traces). We simplify the idea of capturing these patterns by hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs) - and extend the existing approaches by the additional representation of structural information. Our empirical results are based on both synthetic- and real world data. They indicate that the results are easily interpretable, and that the model excels at segmentation and prediction performance: it successfully identifies the generating patterns and can be used for effective prediction of future observations."}
{"text": "Machine-learned models are often described as \"black boxes\". In many real-world applications however, models may have to sacrifice predictive power in favour of human-interpretability. When this is the case, feature engineering becomes a crucial task, which requires significant and time-consuming human effort. Whilst some features are inherently static, representing properties that cannot be influenced (e.g., the age of an individual), others capture characteristics that could be adjusted (e.g., the daily amount of carbohydrates taken). Nonetheless, once a model is learned from the data, each prediction it makes on new instances is irreversible - assuming every instance to be a static point located in the chosen feature space. There are many circumstances however where it is important to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain prediction on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that instance should be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter such a prediction when the mutated instance is input back to the model. In this paper, we present a technique that exploits the internals of a tree-based ensemble classifier to offer recommendations for transforming true negative instances into positively predicted ones. We demonstrate the validity of our approach using an online advertising application. First, we design a Random Forest classifier that effectively separates between two types of ads: low (negative) and high (positive) quality ads (instances). Then, we introduce an algorithm that provides recommendations that aim to transform a low quality ad (negative instance) into a high quality one (positive instance). Finally, we evaluate our approach on a subset of the active inventory of a large ad network, Yahoo Gemini."}
{"text": "In this paper, we present a method to determine the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) from the power measurements of one or more PV systems, located in the same neighborhood. The method is completely unsupervised and is based on a physical model of a PV plant. The precise assessment of solar irradiance is pivotal for the forecast of the electric power generated by photovoltaic (PV) plants. However, on-ground measurements are expensive and are generally not performed for small and medium-sized PV plants. Satellite-based services represent a valid alternative to on site measurements, but their space-time resolution is limited. Results from two case studies located in Switzerland are presented. The performance of the proposed method at assessing GHI is compared with that of free and commercial satellite services. Our results show that the presented method is generally better than satellite-based services, especially at high temporal resolutions."}
{"text": "Two proteins are homologous if they have a common evolutionary origin, and the binary classification problem is to identify proteins in a candidate set that are homologous to a particular native protein. The feature (explanatory) variables available for classification are various measures of similarity of proteins. There are multiple classification problems of this type for different native proteins and their respective candidate sets. Homologous proteins are rare in a single candidate set, giving a highly unbalanced two-class problem. The goal is to rank proteins in a candidate set according to the probability of being homologous to the set's native protein. An ideal classifier will place all the homologous proteins at the head of such a list. Our approach uses an ensemble of models in a classifier and an ensemble of assessment metrics. For a given metric a classifier combines models, each based on a subset of the available feature variables which we call phalanxes. The proposed ensemble of phalanxes identifies strong and diverse subsets of feature variables. A second phase of ensembling aggregates classifiers based on diverse evaluation metrics. The overall result is called an ensemble of phalanxes and metrics. It provide robustness against both close and distant homologues."}
{"text": "This paper describes an expectation propagation (EP) method for multi-class classification with Gaussian processes that scales well to very large datasets. In such a method the estimate of the log-marginal-likelihood involves a sum across the data instances. This enables efficient training using stochastic gradients and mini-batches. When this type of training is used, the computational cost does not depend on the number of data instances $N$. Furthermore, extra assumptions in the approximate inference process make the memory cost independent of $N$. The consequence is that the proposed EP method can be used on datasets with millions of instances. We compare empirically this method with alternative approaches that approximate the required computations using variational inference. The results show that it performs similar or even better than these techniques, which sometimes give significantly worse predictive distributions in terms of the test log-likelihood. Besides this, the training process of the proposed approach also seems to converge in a smaller number of iterations."}
{"text": "We adopt data structure in the form of cover trees and iteratively apply approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) searches for fast compressed sensing reconstruction of signals living on discrete smooth manifolds. Levering on the recent stability results for the inexact Iterative Projected Gradient (IPG) algorithm and by using the cover tree's ANN searches, we decrease the projection cost of the IPG algorithm to be logarithmically growing with data population for low dimensional smooth manifolds. We apply our results to quantitative MRI compressed sensing and in particular within the Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) framework. For a similar (or sometimes better) reconstruction accuracy, we report 2-3 orders of magnitude reduction in computations compared to the standard iterative method which uses brute-force searches."}
{"text": "We present two deep generative models based on Variational Autoencoders to improve the accuracy of drug response prediction. Our models, Perturbation Variational Autoencoder and its semi-supervised extension, Drug Response Variational Autoencoder (Dr.VAE), learn latent representation of the underlying gene states before and after drug application that depend on: (i) drug-induced biological change of each gene and (ii) overall treatment response outcome. Our VAE-based models outperform the current published benchmarks in the field by anywhere from 3 to 11% AUROC and 2 to 30% AUPR. In addition, we found that better reconstruction accuracy does not necessarily lead to improvement in classification accuracy and that jointly trained models perform better than models that minimize reconstruction error independently."}

{"text": "Data lying in a high dimensional ambient space are commonly thought to have a much lower intrinsic dimension. In particular, the data may be concentrated near a lower-dimensional subspace or manifold. There is an immense literature focused on approximating the unknown subspace, and in exploiting such approximations in clustering, data compression, and building of predictive models. Most of the literature relies on approximating subspaces using a locally linear, and potentially multiscale, dictionary. In this article, we propose a simple and general alternative, which instead uses pieces of spheres, or spherelets, to locally approximate the unknown subspace. Theory is developed showing that spherelets can produce lower covering numbers and MSEs for many manifolds. We develop spherical principal components analysis (SPCA). Results relative to state-of-the-art competitors show gains in ability to accurately approximate the subspace with fewer components. In addition, unlike most competitors, our approach can be used for data denoising and can efficiently embed new data without retraining. The methods are illustrated with standard toy manifold learning examples, and applications to multiple real data sets."}
{"text": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with latent variables are probabilistic models which can automatically identify complex stochastic patterns in the data. We describe and study in these models a decomposition of predictive uncertainty into its epistemic and aleatoric components. First, we show how such a decomposition arises naturally in a Bayesian active learning scenario by following an information theoretic approach. Second, we use a similar decomposition to develop a novel risk sensitive objective for safe reinforcement learning (RL). This objective minimizes the effect of model bias in environments whose stochastic dynamics are described by BNNs with latent variables. Our experiments illustrate the usefulness of the resulting decomposition in active learning and safe RL settings."}
{"text": "Power supply from renewable resources is on a global rise where it is forecasted that renewable generation will surpass other types of generation in a foreseeable future. Increased generation from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind, exposes the power grid to more vulnerabilities, conceivably due to their variable generation, thus highlighting the importance of accurate forecasting methods. This paper proposes a two-stage day-ahead solar forecasting method that breaks down the forecasting into linear and nonlinear parts, determines subsequent forecasts, and accordingly, improves accuracy of the obtained results. To further reduce the error resulted from nonstationarity of the historical solar radiation data, a data processing approach, including pre-process and post-process levels, is integrated with the proposed method. Numerical simulations on three test days with different weather conditions exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage model."}
{"text": "We study the problem of learning latent variables in Gaussian graphical models. Existing methods for this problem assume that the precision matrix of the observed variables is the superposition of a sparse and a low-rank component. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the low-rank component, which encodes the effect of marginalization over the latent variables. We introduce fast, proper learning algorithms for this problem. In contrast with existing approaches, our algorithms are manifestly non-convex. We support their efficacy via a rigorous theoretical analysis, and show that our algorithms match the best possible in terms of sample complexity, while achieving computational speed-ups over existing methods. We complement our theory with several numerical experiments."}
{"text": "Learning by children and animals occurs effortlessly and largely without obvious supervision. Successes in automating supervised learning have not translated to the more ambiguous realm of unsupervised learning where goals and labels are not provided. Barlow (1961) suggested that the signal that brains leverage for unsupervised learning is dependence, or redundancy, in the sensory environment. Dependence can be characterized using the information-theoretic multivariate mutual information measure called total correlation. The principle of Total Cor-relation Ex-planation (CorEx) is to learn representations of data that \"explain\" as much dependence in the data as possible. We review some manifestations of this principle along with successes in unsupervised learning problems across diverse domains including human behavior, biology, and language."}
{"text": "The restricted isometry property (RIP) is a universal tool for data recovery. We explore the implication of the RIP in the framework of generalized sparsity and group measurements introduced in the Part I paper. It turns out that for a given measurement instrument the number of measurements for RIP can be improved by optimizing over families of Banach spaces. Second, we investigate the preservation of difference of two sparse vectors, which is not trivial in generalized models. Third, we extend the RIP of partial Fourier measurements at optimal scaling of number of measurements with random sign to far more general group structured measurements. Lastly, we also obtain RIP in infinite dimension in the context of Fourier measurement concepts with sparsity naturally replaced by smoothness assumptions."}
{"text": "Neural network based generative models with discriminative components are a powerful approach for semi-supervised learning. However, these techniques a) cannot account for model uncertainty in the estimation of the model's discriminative component and b) lack flexibility to capture complex stochastic patterns in the label generation process. To avoid these problems, we first propose to use a discriminative component with stochastic inputs for increased noise flexibility. We show how an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure can marginalize the stochastic inputs when inferring missing labels in this model. Following this, we extend the discriminative component to be fully Bayesian and produce estimates of uncertainty in its parameter values. This opens the door for semi-supervised Bayesian active learning."}
{"text": "Interpreting gradient methods as fixed-point iterations, we provide a detailed analysis of those methods for minimizing convex objective functions. Due to their conceptual and algorithmic simplicity, gradient methods are widely used in machine learning for massive data sets (big data). In particular, stochastic gradient methods are considered the de- facto standard for training deep neural networks. Studying gradient methods within the realm of fixed-point theory provides us with powerful tools to analyze their convergence properties. In particular, gradient methods using inexact or noisy gradients, such as stochastic gradient descent, can be studied conveniently using well-known results on inexact fixed-point iterations. Moreover, as we demonstrate in this paper, the fixed-point approach allows an elegant derivation of accelerations for basic gradient methods. In particular, we will show how gradient descent can be accelerated by a fixed-point preserving transformation of an operator associated with the objective function."}
{"text": "A rising topic in computational journalism is how to enhance the diversity in news served to subscribers to foster exploration behavior in news reading. Despite the success of preference learning in personalized news recommendation, their over-exploitation causes filter bubble that isolates readers from opposing viewpoints and hurts long-term user experiences with lack of serendipity. Since news providers can recommend neither opposite nor diversified opinions if unpopularity of these articles is surely predicted, they can only bet on the articles whose forecasts of click-through rate involve high variability (risks) or high estimation errors (uncertainties). We propose a novel Bayesian model of uncertainty-aware scoring and ranking for news articles. The Bayesian binary classifier models probability of success (defined as a news click) as a Beta-distributed random variable conditional on a vector of the context (user features, article features, and other contextual features). The posterior of the contextual coefficients can be computed efficiently using a low-rank version of Laplace's method via thin Singular Value Decomposition. Efficiencies in personalized targeting of exceptional articles, which are chosen by each subscriber in test period, are evaluated on real-world news datasets. The proposed estimator slightly outperformed existing training and scoring algorithms, in terms of efficiency in identifying successful outliers."}

The interpretation of the results meshes well with subject-area expertise and also suggests a novel understanding of what differentiates players."}
{"text": "When devising a course of treatment for a patient, doctors often have little quantitative evidence on which to base their decisions, beyond their medical education and published clinical trials. Stanford Health Care alone has millions of electronic medical records (EMRs) that are only just recently being leveraged to inform better treatment recommendations. These data present a unique challenge because they are high-dimensional and observational. Our goal is to make personalized treatment recommendations based on the outcomes for past patients similar to a new patient. We propose and analyze three methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using observational data. Our methods perform well in simulations using a wide variety of treatment effect functions, and we present results of applying the two most promising methods to data from The SPRINT Data Analysis Challenge, from a large randomized trial of a treatment for high blood pressure."}
{"text": "Tomal et al. (2015) introduced the notion of \"phalanxes\" in the context of rare-class detection in two-class classification problems. A phalanx is a subset of features that work well for classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a different class of phalanxes for application in regression settings. We define a \"Regression Phalanx\" - a subset of features that work well together for prediction. We propose a novel algorithm which automatically chooses Regression Phalanxes from high-dimensional data sets using hierarchical clustering and builds a prediction model for each phalanx for further ensembling. Through extensive simulation studies and several real-life applications in various areas (including drug discovery, chemical analysis of spectra data, microarray analysis and climate projections) we show that an ensemble of Regression Phalanxes improves prediction accuracy when combined with effective prediction methods like Lasso or Random Forests."}
{"text": "Modes and ridges of the probability density function behind observed data are useful geometric features. Mode-seeking clustering assigns cluster labels by associating data samples with the nearest modes, and estimation of density ridges enables us to find lower-dimensional structures hidden in data. A key technical challenge both in mode-seeking clustering and density ridge estimation is accurate estimation of the ratios of the first- and second-order density derivatives to the density. A naive approach takes a three-step approach of first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density derivative estimator, and division by the estimated density could significantly magnify the estimation error. To cope with these problems, we propose a novel estimator for the \\emph{density-derivative-ratios}. The proposed estimator does not involve density estimation, but rather \\emph{directly} approximates the ratios of density derivatives of any order. Moreover, we establish a convergence rate of the proposed estimator. Based on the proposed estimator, novel methods both for mode-seeking clustering and density ridge estimation are developed, and the respective convergence rates to the mode and ridge of the underlying density are also established. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that the developed methods significantly outperform existing methods, particularly for relatively high-dimensional data."}
{"text": "We propose a K-sparse exhaustive search (ES-K) method and a K-sparse approximate exhaustive search method (AES-K) for selecting variables in linear regression. With these methods, K-sparse combinations of variables are tested exhaustively assuming that the optimal combination of explanatory variables is K-sparse. By collecting the results of exhaustively computing ES-K, various approximate methods for selecting sparse variables can be summarized as density of states. With this density of states, we can compare different methods for selecting sparse variables such as relaxation and sampling. For large problems where the combinatorial explosion of explanatory variables is crucial, the AES-K method enables density of states to be effectively reconstructed by using the replica-exchange Monte Carlo method and the multiple histogram method. Applying the ES-K and AES-K methods to type Ia supernova data, we confirmed the conventional understanding in astronomy when an appropriate K is given beforehand. However, we found the difficulty to determine K from the data. Using virtual measurement and analysis, we argue that this is caused by data shortage."}
{"text": "Given full or partial information about a collection of points that lie close to a union of several subspaces, subspace clustering refers to the process of clustering the points according to their subspace and identifying the subspaces. One popular approach, sparse subspace clustering (SSC), represents each sample as a weighted combination of the other samples, with weights of minimal $\\ell_1$ norm, and then uses those learned weights to cluster the samples. SSC is stable in settings where each sample is contaminated by a relatively small amount of noise. However, when there is a significant amount of additive noise, or a considerable number of entries are missing, theoretical guarantees are scarce. In this paper, we study a robust variant of SSC and establish clustering guarantees in the presence of corrupted or missing data. We give explicit bounds on amount of noise and missing data that the algorithm can tolerate, both in deterministic settings and in a random generative model. Notably, our approach provides guarantees for higher tolerance to noise and missing data than existing analyses for this method. By design, the results hold even when we do not know the locations of the missing data; e.g., as in presence-only data."}
{"text": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have excellent representative power and are state of the art classifiers on many tasks. However, they often do not capture their own uncertainties well making them less robust in the real world as they overconfidently extrapolate and do not notice domain shift. Gaussian processes (GPs) with RBF kernels on the other hand have better calibrated uncertainties and do not overconfidently extrapolate far from data in their training set. However, GPs have poor representational power and do not perform as well as DNNs on complex domains. In this paper we show that GP hybrid deep networks, GPDNNs, (GPs on top of DNNs and trained end-to-end) inherit the nice properties of both GPs and DNNs and are much more robust to adversarial examples. When extrapolating to adversarial examples and testing in domain shift settings, GPDNNs frequently output high entropy class probabilities corresponding to essentially \"don't know\". GPDNNs are therefore promising as deep architectures that know when they don't know."}
{"text": "We develop a model in which interactions between nodes of a dynamic network are counted by non homogeneous Poisson processes. In a block modelling perspective, nodes belong to hidden clusters (whose number is unknown) and the intensity functions of the counting processes only depend on the clusters of nodes. In order to make inference tractable we move to discrete time by partitioning the entire time horizon in which interactions are observed in fixed-length time sub-intervals. First, we derive an exact integrated classification likelihood criterion and maximize it relying on a greedy search approach. This allows to estimate the memberships to clusters and the number of clusters simultaneously. Then a maximum-likelihood estimator is developed to estimate non parametrically the integrated intensities. We discuss the over-fitting problems of the model and propose a regularized version solving these issues. Experiments on real and simulated data are carried out in order to assess the proposed methodology."}
{"text": "Sparsity learning with known grouping structure has received considerable attention due to wide modern applications in high-dimensional data analysis. Although advantages of using group information have been well-studied by shrinkage-based approaches, benefits of group sparsity have not been well-documented for greedy-type methods, which much limits our understanding and use of this important class of methods. In this paper, generalizing from a popular forward-backward greedy approach, we propose a new interactive greedy algorithm for group sparsity learning and prove that the proposed greedy-type algorithm attains the desired benefits of group sparsity under high dimensional settings. An estimation error bound refining other existing methods and a guarantee for group support recovery are also established simultaneously. In addition, we incorporate a general M-estimation framework and introduce an interactive feature to allow extra algorithm flexibility without compromise in theoretical properties. The promising use of our proposal is demonstrated through numerical evaluations including a real industrial application in human activity recognition at home. Supplementary materials for this article are available online."}

{"text": "Given the observation of a high-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process in continuous time, we proceed to the inference of the drift parameter under a row-sparsity assumption. Towards that aim, we consider the negative log-likelihood of the process, penalized by an $\\ell^1$-penalization (Lasso and Adaptive Lasso). We provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic results for this procedure, by means of a sharp oracle inequality, and a limit theorem in the long-time asymptotics, including asymptotic consistency for variable selection. As a by-product, we point out the fact that for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, one does not need an assumption of restricted eigenvalue type in order to derive fast rates for the Lasso, while it is well-known to be mandatory for linear regression for instance. Numerical results illustrate the benefits of this penalized procedure compared to standard maximum likelihood approaches both on simulations and real-world financial data."}
{"text": "We propose a method for estimating coefficients in multivariate regression when there is a clustering structure to the response variables. The proposed method includes a fusion penalty, to shrink the difference in fitted values from responses in the same cluster, and an L1 penalty for simultaneous variable selection and estimation. The method can be used when the grouping structure of the response variables is known or unknown. When the clustering structure is unknown the method will simultaneously estimate the clusters of the response and the regression coefficients. Theoretical results are presented for the penalized least squares case, including asymptotic results allowing for p >> n. We extend our method to the setting where the responses are binomial variables. We propose a coordinate descent algorithm for both the normal and binomial likelihood, which can easily be extended to other generalized linear model (GLM) settings. Simulations and data examples from business operations and genomics are presented to show the merits of both the least squares and binomial methods."}
{"text": "This paper presents an approach for automation of interpretable feature selection for Internet Of Things Analytics (IoTA) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Authors have conducted a survey over different people involved in different IoTA based application development tasks. The survey reveals that feature selection is the most time consuming and niche skill demanding part of the entire workflow. This paper shows how feature selection is successfully automated without sacrificing the decision making accuracy and thereby reducing the project completion time and cost of hiring expensive resources. Several pattern recognition principles and state of art (SoA) ML techniques are followed to design the overall approach for the proposed automation. Three data sets are considered to establish the proof-of-concept. Experimental results show that the proposed automation is able to reduce the time for feature selection to $2$ days instead of $4-6$ months which would have been required in absence of the automation. This reduction in time is achieved without any sacrifice in the accuracy of the decision making process. Proposed method is also compared against Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model as most of the state of the art works on IoTA uses MLP based Deep Learning. Moreover the feature selection method is compared against SoA feature reduction technique namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its variants. The results obtained show that the proposed method is effective."}
{"text": "We propose a novel, theoretically-grounded, acquisition function for Batch Bayesian optimization informed by insights from distributionally ambiguous optimization. Our acquisition function is a lower bound on the well-known Expected Improvement function, which requires evaluation of a Gaussian Expectation over a multivariate piecewise affine function. Our bound is computed instead by evaluating the best-case expectation over all probability distributions consistent with the same mean and variance as the original Gaussian distribution. Unlike alternative approaches, including Expected Improvement, our proposed acquisition function avoids multi-dimensional integrations entirely, and can be computed exactly - even on large batch sizes - as the solution of a tractable convex optimization problem. Our suggested acquisition function can also be optimized efficiently, since first and second derivative information can be calculated inexpensively as by-products of the acquisition function calculation itself. We derive various novel theorems that ground our work theoretically and we demonstrate superior performance via simple motivating examples, benchmark functions and real-world problems."}
{"text": "In this study, we tested the interaction effect of multimodal datasets using a novel method called the kernel method for detecting higher order interactions among biologically relevant mulit-view data. Using a semiparametric method on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we used a standard mixed-effects linear model and derived a score-based variance component statistic that tests for higher order interactions between multi-view data. The proposed method offers an intangible framework for the identification of higher order interaction effects (e.g., three way interaction) between genetics, brain imaging, and epigenetic data. Extensive numerical simulation studies were first conducted to evaluate the performance of this method. Finally, this method was evaluated using data from the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation data, respectfully, in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. We treated each gene-derived SNPs, region of interest (ROI) and gene-derived DNA methylation as a single testing unit, which are combined into triplets for evaluation. In addition, cardiovascular disease risk factors such as age, gender, and body mass index were assessed as covariates on hippocampal volume and compared between triplets. Our method identified $13$-triplets ($p$-values $\\leq 0.001$) that included $6$ gene-derived SNPs, $10$ ROIs, and $6$ gene-derived DNA methylations that correlated with changes in hippocampal volume, suggesting that these triplets may be important in explaining schizophrenia-related neurodegeneration. With strong evidence ($p$-values $\\leq 0.000001$), the triplet ({\\bf MAGI2, CRBLCrus1.L, FBXO28}) has the potential to distinguish schizophrenia patients from the healthy control variations."}
{"text": "Nowadays, with the unprecedented penetration of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), the necessity of an efficient energy forecasting model is more demanding than before. Generally, forecasting models are trained using observed weather data while the trained models are applied for energy forecasting using forecasted weather data. In this study, the performance of several commonly used forecasting methods in the presence of weather predictors with uncertainty is assessed and compared. Accordingly, both observed and forecasted weather data are collected, then the influential predictors for solar PV generation forecasting model are selected using several measures. Using observed and forecasted weather data, an analysis on the uncertainty of weather variables is represented by MAE and bootstrapping. The energy forecasting model is trained using observed weather data, and finally, the performance of several commonly used forecasting methods in solar energy forecasting is simulated and compared for a real case study."}
{"text": "We study learning problems involving arbitrary classes of functions $F$, distributions $X$ and targets $Y$. Because proper learning procedures, i.e., procedures that are only allowed to select functions in $F$, tend to perform poorly unless the problem satisfies some additional structural property (e.g., that $F$ is convex), we consider unrestricted learning procedures that are free to choose functions outside the given class.   We present a new unrestricted procedure that is optimal in a very strong sense: the required sample complexity is essentially the best one can hope for, and the estimate holds for (almost) any problem, including heavy-tailed situations. Moreover, the sample complexity coincides with the what one would expect if $F$ were convex, even when $F$ is not. And if $F$ is convex, the procedure turns out to be proper. Thus, the unrestricted procedure is actually optimal in both realms, for convex classes as a proper procedure and for arbitrary classes as an unrestricted procedure."}
{"text": "We provide two main contributions in PAC-Bayesian theory for domain adaptation where the objective is to learn, from a source distribution, a well-performing majority vote on a different, but related, target distribution. Firstly, we propose an improvement of the previous approach we proposed in Germain et al. (2013), which relies on a novel distribution pseudodistance based on a disagreement averaging, allowing us to derive a new tighter domain adaptation bound for the target risk. While this bound stands in the spirit of common domain adaptation works, we derive a second bound (introduced in Germain et al., 2016) that brings a new perspective on domain adaptation by deriving an upper bound on the target risk where the distributions' divergence-expressed as a ratio-controls the trade-off between a source error measure and the target voters' disagreement. We discuss and compare both results, from which we obtain PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. Furthermore, from the PAC-Bayesian specialization to linear classifiers, we infer two learning algorithms, and we evaluate them on real data."}
{"text": "We propose a simple method that combines neural networks and Gaussian processes. The proposed method can estimate the uncertainty of outputs and flexibly adjust target functions where training data exist, which are advantages of Gaussian processes. The proposed method can also achieve high generalization performance for unseen input configurations, which is an advantage of neural networks. With the proposed method, neural networks are used for the mean functions of Gaussian processes. We present a scalable stochastic inference procedure, where sparse Gaussian processes are inferred by stochastic variational inference, and the parameters of neural networks and kernels are estimated by stochastic gradient descent methods, simultaneously. We use two real-world spatio-temporal data sets to demonstrate experimentally that the proposed method achieves better uncertainty estimation and generalization performance than neural networks and Gaussian processes."}
{"text": "Neyman-Scott is a classic example of an estimation problem with a partially-consistent posterior, for which standard estimation methods tend to produce inconsistent results. Past attempts to create consistent estimators for Neyman-Scott have led to ad-hoc solutions, to estimators that do not satisfy representation invariance, to restrictions over the choice of prior and more. We present a simple construction for a general-purpose Bayes estimator, invariant to representation, which satisfies consistency on Neyman-Scott over any non-degenerate prior. We argue that the good attributes of the estimator are due to its intrinsic properties, and generalise beyond Neyman-Scott as well."}
{"text": "The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has delivered valuable sensing of surface soil moisture since 2015. However, it has a short time span and irregular revisit schedule. Utilizing a state-of-the-art time-series deep learning neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), we created a system that predicts SMAP level-3 soil moisture data with atmospheric forcing, model-simulated moisture, and static physiographic attributes as inputs. The system removes most of the bias with model simulations and improves predicted moisture climatology, achieving small test root-mean-squared error (<0.035) and high correlation coefficient >0.87 for over 75\\% of Continental United States, including the forested Southeast. As the first application of LSTM in hydrology, we show the proposed network avoids overfitting and is robust for both temporal and spatial extrapolation tests. LSTM generalizes well across regions with distinct climates and physiography. With high fidelity to SMAP, LSTM shows great potential for hindcasting, data assimilation, and weather forecasting."}
{"text": "We propose a simple algorithm to train stochastic neural networks to draw samples from given target distributions for probabilistic inference. Our method is based on iteratively adjusting the neural network parameters so that the output changes along a Stein variational gradient direction (Liu & Wang, 2016) that maximally decreases the KL divergence with the target distribution. Our method works for any target distribution specified by their unnormalized density function, and can train any black-box architectures that are differentiable in terms of the parameters we want to adapt. We demonstrate our method with a number of applications, including variational autoencoder (VAE) with expressive encoders to model complex latent space structures, and hyper-parameter learning of MCMC samplers that allows Bayesian inference to adaptively improve itself when seeing more data."}
{"text": "In this study, we present a multi-class graphical Bayesian predictive classifier that incorporates the uncertainty in the model selection into the standard Bayesian formalism. For each class, the dependence structure underlying the observed features is represented by a set of decomposable Gaussian graphical models. Emphasis is then placed on the Bayesian model averaging which takes full account of the class-specific model uncertainty by averaging over the posterior graph model probabilities. An explicit evaluation of the model probabilities is well known to be infeasible. To address this issue, we consider the particle Gibbs strategy of Olsson et al. (2018b) for posterior sampling from decomposable graphical models which utilizes the Christmas tree algorithm of Olsson et al. (2018a) as proposal kernel. We also derive a strong hyper Markov law which we call the hyper normal Wishart law that allow to perform the resultant Bayesian calculations locally. The proposed predictive graphical classifier reveals superior performance compared to the ordinary Bayesian predictive rule that does not account for the model uncertainty, as well as to a number of out-of-the-box classifiers."}
{"text": "Mobile technologies offer opportunities for higher resolution monitoring of health conditions. This opportunity seems of particular promise in psychiatry where diagnoses often rely on retrospective and subjective recall of mood states. However, getting actionable information from these rather complex time series is challenging, and at present the implications for clinical care are largely hypothetical. This research demonstrates that, with well chosen cohorts (of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and control) and modern methods, it is possible to objectively learn to identify distinctive behaviour over short periods (20 reports) that effectively separate the cohorts. Participants with bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder and healthy volunteers completed daily mood ratings using a bespoke smartphone app for up to a year. A signature-based machine learning model was used to classify participants on the basis of the interrelationship between the different mood items assessed and to predict subsequent mood. The signature methodology was significantly superior to earlier statistical approaches applied to this data in distinguishing the participant three groups, clearly placing 75% into their original groups on the basis of their reports. Subsequent mood ratings were correctly predicted with greater than 70% accuracy in all groups. Prediction of mood was most accurate in healthy volunteers (89-98%) compared to bipolar disorder (82-90%) and borderline personality disorder (70-78%)."}

It gives a comprehensive overview of the most commonly de-tected phenotypes and its underlying data sets. Special attention is given to preprocessing of in-put data and the different modeling approaches. The literature review confirms natural language processing to be a promising approach for electronic phenotyping.

Future research should develop such standards and further investigate which machine learning approaches are best suited to which type of medical data."}
{"text": "Bayesian nonparametrics are a class of probabilistic models in which the model size is inferred from data. A recently developed methodology in this field is small-variance asymptotic analysis, a mathematical technique for deriving learning algorithms that capture much of the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric inference algorithms, but are simpler to implement and less computationally expensive. Past work on small-variance analysis of Bayesian nonparametric inference algorithms has exclusively considered batch models trained on a single, static dataset, which are incapable of capturing time evolution in the latent structure of the data. This work presents a small-variance analysis of the maximum a posteriori filtering problem for a temporally varying mixture model with a Markov dependence structure, which captures temporally evolving clusters within a dataset. Two clustering algorithms result from the analysis: D-Means, an iterative clustering algorithm for linearly separable, spherical clusters; and SD-Means, a spectral clustering algorithm derived from a kernelized, relaxed version of the clustering problem. Empirical results from experiments demonstrate the advantages of using D-Means and SD-Means over contemporary clustering algorithms, in terms of both computational cost and clustering accuracy."}
{"text": "Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and orthogonal least squares (OLS) are widely used for sparse signal reconstruction in under-determined linear regression problems. The performance of these compressed sensing (CS) algorithms depends crucially on the \\textit{a priori} knowledge of either the sparsity of the signal ($k_0$) or noise variance ($\\sigma^2$). Both $k_0$ and $\\sigma^2$ are unknown in general and extremely difficult to estimate in under determined models. This limits the application of OMP and OLS in many practical situations. In this article, we develop two computationally efficient frameworks namely TF-IGP and RRT-IGP for using OMP and OLS even when $k_0$ and $\\sigma^2$ are unavailable. Both TF-IGP and RRT-IGP are analytically shown to accomplish successful sparse recovery under the same set of restricted isometry conditions on the design matrix required for OMP/OLS with \\textit{a priori} knowledge of $k_0$ and $\\sigma^2$. Numerical simulations also indicate a highly competitive performance of TF-IGP and RRT-IGP in comparison to OMP/OLS with \\textit{a priori} knowledge of $k_0$ and $\\sigma^2$."}
{"text": "New technologies for recording the activity of large neural populations during complex behavior provide exciting opportunities for investigating the neural computations that underlie perception, cognition, and decision-making. Nonlinear state space models provide an interpretable signal processing framework by combining an intuitive dynamical system with a probabilistic observation model, which can provide insights into neural dynamics, neural computation, and development of neural prosthetics and treatment through feedback control. It brings the challenge of learning both latent neural state and the underlying dynamical system because neither is known for neural systems a priori. We developed a flexible online learning framework for latent nonlinear state dynamics and filtered latent states. Using the stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach, our method jointly optimizes the parameters of the nonlinear dynamical system, the observation model, and the black-box recognition model. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can incorporate non-trivial distributions of observation noise and has constant time and space complexity. These features make our approach amenable to real-time applications and the potential to automate analysis and experimental design in ways that testably track and modify behavior using stimuli designed to influence learning."}
{"text": "In this paper, a generalized multivariate Student-t mixture model is developed for classification and clustering of Low Probability of Intercept radar waveforms. A Low Probability of Intercept radar signal is characterized by a pulse compression waveform which is either frequency-modulated or phase-modulated. The proposed model can classify and cluster different modulation types such as linear frequency modulation, non linear frequency modulation, polyphase Barker, polyphase P1, P2, P3, P4, Frank and Zadoff codes. The classification method focuses on the introduction of a new prior distribution for the model hyper-parameters that gives us the possibility to handle sensitivity of mixture models to initialization and to allow a less restrictive modeling of data. Inference is processed through a Variational Bayes method and a Bayesian treatment is adopted for model learning, supervised classification and clustering. Moreover, the novel prior distribution is not a well-known probability distribution and both deterministic and stochastic methods are employed to estimate its expectations. Some numerical experiments show that the proposed method is less sensitive to initialization and provides more accurate results than the previous state of the art mixture models."}
{"text": "Two-sample feature selection is the problem of finding features that describe a difference between two probability distributions, which is a ubiquitous problem in both scientific and engineering studies. However, existing methods have limited applicability because of their restrictive assumptions on data distributoins or computational difficulty. In this paper, we resolve these difficulties by formulating the problem as a sparsest $k$-subgraph problem. The proposed method is nonparametric and does not assume any specific parametric models on the data distributions. We show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and does not require any extra computation for model selection. Moreover, we prove that the proposed method provides a consistent estimator of features under mild conditions. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the current method with regard to both accuracy and computation time."}
{"text": "Transfer learning aims to improve learning in target domain by borrowing knowledge from a related but different source domain. To reduce the distribution shift between source and target domains, recent methods have focused on exploring invariant representations that have similar distributions across domains. However, when learning this invariant knowledge, existing methods assume that the labels in source domain are uncontaminated, while in reality, we often have access to source data with noisy labels. In this paper, we first show how label noise adversely affect the learning of invariant representations and the correcting of label shift in various transfer learning scenarios. To reduce the adverse effects, we propose a novel Denoising Conditional Invariant Component (DCIC) framework, which provably ensures (1) extracting invariant representations given examples with noisy labels in source domain and unlabeled examples in target domain; (2) estimating the label distribution in target domain with no bias. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "Real data often contain anomalous cases, also known as outliers. These may spoil the resulting analysis but they may also contain valuable information. In either case, the ability to detect such anomalies is essential. A useful tool for this purpose is robust statistics, which aims to detect the outliers by first fitting the majority of the data and then flagging data points that deviate from it. We present an overview of several robust methods and the resulting graphical outlier detection tools. We discuss robust procedures for univariate, low-dimensional, and high-dimensional data, such as estimating location and scatter, linear regression, principal component analysis, classification, clustering, and functional data analysis. Also the challenging new topic of cellwise outliers is introduced."}
{"text": "Disease classification is a crucial element of biomedical research. Recent studies have demonstrated that machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling, produce similar or improved predictive capabilities in comparison to the traditional method of Logistic Regression. In addition, it has been found that social network metrics can provide useful predictive information for disease modeling. In this study, we combine simulated social network metrics with SVM to predict diabetes in a sample of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. In this dataset, Logistic Regression outperformed SVM with ROC index of 81.8 and 81.7 for models with and without graph metrics, respectively. SVM with a polynomial kernel had ROC index of 72.9 and 75.6 for models with and without graph metrics, respectively. Although this did not perform as well as Logistic Regression, the results are consistent with previous studies utilizing SVM to classify diabetes."}
{"text": "Tensor train (TT) decomposition provides a space-efficient representation for higher-order tensors. Despite its advantage, we face two crucial limitations when we apply the TT decomposition to machine learning problems: the lack of statistical theory and of scalable algorithms. In this paper, we address the limitations. First, we introduce a convex relaxation of the TT decomposition problem and derive its error bound for the tensor completion task. Next, we develop an alternating optimization method with a randomization technique, in which the time complexity is as efficient as the space complexity is. In experiments, we numerically confirm the derived bounds and empirically demonstrate the performance of our method with a real higher-order tensor."}
{"text": "Quick and accurate medical diagnosis is crucial for the successful treatment of a disease. Using machine learning algorithms, we have built two models to predict a hematologic disease, based on laboratory blood test results. In one predictive model, we used all available blood test parameters and in the other a reduced set, which is usually measured upon patient admittance. Both models produced good results, with a prediction accuracy of 0.88 and 0.86, when considering the list of five most probable diseases, and 0.59 and 0.57, when considering only the most probable disease. Models did not differ significantly from each other, which indicates that a reduced set of parameters contains a relevant fingerprint of a disease, expanding the utility of the model for general practitioner's use and indicating that there is more information in the blood test results than physicians recognize. In the clinical test we showed that the accuracy of our predictive models was on a par with the ability of hematology specialists. Our study is the first to show that a machine learning predictive model based on blood tests alone, can be successfully applied to predict hematologic diseases and could open up unprecedented possibilities in medical diagnosis."}

We construct a very flexible implicit variational distribution synthesized by an arbitrary Markov chain Monte Carlo operation and a deterministic transformation that can be optimized using the reparametrization trick.

We demonstrate the proposed algorithm for fitting banana-shaped distributions and for training variational autoencoders."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimating a regression function in the common situation where the number of features is small, where interpretability of the model is a high priority, and where simple linear or additive models fail to provide adequate performance. To address this problem, we present Maximum Variance Total Variation denoising (MVTV), an approach that is conceptually related both to CART and to the more recent CRISP algorithm, a state-of-the-art alternative method for interpretable nonlinear regression. MVTV divides the feature space into blocks of constant value and fits the value of all blocks jointly via a convex optimization routine. Our method is fully data-adaptive, in that it incorporates highly robust routines for tuning all hyperparameters automatically. We compare our approach against CART and CRISP via both a complexity-accuracy tradeoff metric and a human study, demonstrating that that MVTV is a more powerful and interpretable method."}
{"text": "Very few K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) ensembles exist, despite the efficacy of this approach in regression, classification, and outlier detection. Those that do exist focus on bagging features, rather than varying k or bagging observations; it is unknown whether varying k or bagging observations can improve prediction. Given recent studies from topological data analysis, varying k may function like multiscale topological methods, providing stability and better prediction, as well as increased ensemble diversity.   This paper explores 7 KNN ensemble algorithms combining bagged features, bagged observations, and varied k to understand how each of these contribute to model fit. Specifically, these algorithms are tested on Tweedie regression problems through simulations and 6 real datasets; results are compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models including extreme learning machines, random forest, boosted regression, and Morse-Smale regression.   Results on simulations suggest gains from varying k above and beyond bagging features or samples, as well as the robustness of KNN ensembles to the curse of dimensionality. KNN regression ensembles perform favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms and dramatically improve performance over KNN regression. Further, real dataset results suggest varying k is a good strategy in general (particularly for difficult Tweedie regression problems) and that KNN regression ensembles often outperform state-of-the-art methods.   These results for k-varying ensembles echo recent theoretical results in topological data analysis, where multidimensional filter functions and multiscale coverings provide stability and performance gains over single-dimensional filters and single-scale covering. This opens up the possibility of leveraging multiscale neighborhoods and multiple measures of local geometry in ensemble methods."}
{"text": "Gaussian process regression generally does not scale to beyond a few thousands data points without applying some sort of kernel approximation method. Most approximations focus on the high eigenvalue part of the spectrum of the kernel matrix, $K$, which leads to bad performance when the length scale of the kernel is small. In this paper we introduce Multiresolution Kernel Approximation (MKA), the first true broad bandwidth kernel approximation algorithm. Important points about MKA are that it is memory efficient, and it is a direct method, which means that it also makes it easy to approximate $K^{-1}$ and $\\mathop{\\textrm{det}}(K)$."}
{"text": "Consider a structured matrix factorization model where one factor is restricted to have its columns lying in the unit simplex. This simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) model and the associated factorization techniques have spurred much interest in research topics over different areas, such as hyperspectral unmixing in remote sensing, topic discovery in machine learning, to name a few. In this paper we develop a new theoretical SSMF framework whose idea is to study a maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed in the convex hull of the data points. This maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid (MVIE) idea has not been attempted in prior literature, and we show a sufficient condition under which the MVIE framework guarantees exact recovery of the factors. The sufficient recovery condition we show for MVIE is much more relaxed than that of separable non-negative matrix factorization (or pure-pixel search); coincidentally it is also identical to that of minimum volume enclosing simplex, which is known to be a powerful SSMF framework for non-separable problem instances. We also show that MVIE can be practically implemented by performing facet enumeration and then by solving a convex optimization problem. The potential of the MVIE framework is illustrated by numerical results."}

We study certain families of structured superposition models, and propose a method which provably recovers the components given (nearly) $m = \\mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$ denotes the sparsity level of the underlying components. This strictly improves upon previous nonlinear demixing techniques and asymptotically matches the best possible sample complexity. We also provide a range of simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "A fundamental question in data analysis, machine learning and signal processing is how to compare between data points. The choice of the distance metric is specifically challenging for high-dimensional data sets, where the problem of meaningfulness is more prominent (e.g. the Euclidean distance between images). In this paper, we propose to exploit a property of high-dimensional data that is usually ignored - which is the structure stemming from the relationships between the coordinates. Specifically we show that organizing similar coordinates in clusters can be exploited for the construction of the Mahalanobis distance between samples. When the observable samples are generated by a nonlinear transformation of hidden variables, the Mahalanobis distance allows the recovery of the Euclidean distances in the hidden space.We illustrate the advantage of our approach on a synthetic example where the discovery of clusters of correlated coordinates improves the estimation of the principal directions of the samples. Our method was applied to real data of gene expression for lung adenocarcinomas (lung cancer). By using the proposed metric we found a partition of subjects to risk groups with a good separation between their Kaplan-Meier survival plot."}
{"text": "Malaria is a serious infectious disease that is responsible for over half million deaths yearly worldwide. The major cause of these mortalities is late or inaccurate diagnosis. Manual microscopy is currently considered as the dominant diagnostic method for malaria. However, it is time consuming and prone to human errors.

This paper describes the manufactured hardware and also proposes novel software to handle parasite detection and life-stage identification. A motorized microscope is developed to take images from Giemsa-stained blood smears. A patch-based unsupervised statistical clustering algorithm is proposed which offers a novel method for classification of different regions within blood images. The proposed method provides better robustness against different imaging settings. The core of the proposed algorithm is a model called Mixture of Independent Component Analysis. A manifold based optimization method is proposed that facilitates the application of the model for high dimensional data usually acquired in medical microscopy.

{"text": "Choosing the best-performing optimizer(s) out of a portfolio of optimization algorithms is usually a difficult and complex task. It gets even worse, if the underlying functions are unknown, i.e., so-called Black-Box problems, and function evaluations are considered to be expensive. In the case of continuous single-objective optimization problems, Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) - a sophisticated and effective approach for characterizing the landscapes of such problems by means of numerical values before actually performing the optimization task itself - is advantageous. Unfortunately, until now it has been quite complicated to compute multiple ELA features simultaneously, as the corresponding code has been - if at all - spread across multiple platforms or at least across several packages within these platforms.   This article presents a broad summary of existing ELA approaches and introduces flacco, an R-package for feature-based landscape analysis of continuous and constrained optimization problems. Although its functions neither solve the optimization problem itself nor the related \"Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP)\", it offers easy access to an essential ingredient of the ASP by providing a wide collection of ELA features on a single platform - even within a single package. In addition, flacco provides multiple visualization techniques, which enhance the understanding of some of these numerical features, and thereby make certain landscape properties more comprehensible. On top of that, we will introduce the package's build-in, as well as web-hosted and hence platform-independent, graphical user interface (GUI), which facilitates the usage of the package - especially for people who are not familiar with R - making it a very convenient toolbox when working towards algorithm selection of continuous single-objective optimization problems."}
{"text": "Although various distributed machine learning schemes have been proposed recently for pure linear models and fully nonparametric models, little attention has been paid on distributed optimization for semi-paramemetric models with multiple-level structures (e.g. sparsity, linearity and nonlinearity). To address these issues, the current paper proposes a new communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm for partially sparse linear models with an increasing number of features. The proposed method is based on the classical divide and conquer strategy for handing big data and each sub-method defined on each subsample consists of a debiased estimation of the double-regularized least squares approach. With the proposed method, we theoretically prove that our global parametric estimator can achieve optimal parametric rate in our semi-parametric model given an appropriate partition on the total data. Specially, the choice of data partition relies on the underlying smoothness of the nonparametric component, but it is adaptive to the sparsity parameter. Even under the non-distributed setting, we develop a new and easily-read proof for optimal estimation of the parametric error in high dimensional partial linear model. Finally, several simulated experiments are implemented to indicate comparable empirical performance of our debiased technique under the distributed setting."}

We derive exact analytical expressions for the estimators and we analyse their properties both analytically and via simulation.

Given the structure of the network, the proposed approach better estimates the joint distribution and significantly improves the classification performance with respect to traditional approaches."}

{"text": "Graphical Lasso (GL) is a popular method for learning the structure of an undirected graphical model, which is based on an $l_1$ regularization technique. The objective of this paper is to compare the computationally-heavy GL technique with a numerically-cheap heuristic method that is based on simply thresholding the sample covariance matrix. To this end, two notions of sign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices are developed, and then it is shown that the thresholding and GL methods are equivalent if: (i) the thresholded sample covariance matrix is both sign-consistent and inverse-consistent, and (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the smallest un-thresholded entries of the sample covariance matrix is not too small. By building upon this result, it is proved that the GL method---as a conic optimization problem---has an explicit closed-form solution if the thresholded sample covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. This result is then generalized to arbitrary sparse support graphs, where a formula is found to obtain an approximate solution of GL. Furthermore, it is shown that the approximation error of the derived explicit formula decreases exponentially fast with respect to the length of the minimum-length cycle of the sparsity graph. The developed results are demonstrated on synthetic data, functional MRI data, traffic flows for transportation networks, and massive randomly generated data sets. We show that the proposed method can obtain an accurate approximation of the GL for instances with the sizes as large as $80,000\\times 80,000$ (more than 3.2 billion variables) in less than 30 minutes on a standard laptop computer running MATLAB, while other state-of-the-art methods do not converge within 4 hours."}
{"text": "Sparse alpha-norm regularization has many data-rich applications in Marketing and Economics. Alpha-norm, in contrast to lasso and ridge regularization, jumps to a sparse solution. This feature is attractive for ultra high-dimensional problems that occur in demand estimation and forecasting. The alpha-norm objective is nonconvex and requires coordinate descent and proximal operators to find the sparse solution. We study a typical marketing demand forecasting problem, grocery store sales for salty snacks, that has many dummy variables as controls. The key predictors of demand include price, equivalized volume, promotion, flavor, scent, and brand effects. By comparing with many commonly used machine learning methods, alpha-norm regularization achieves its goal of providing accurate out-of-sample estimates for the promotion lift effects. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research."}
{"text": "The consistency of doubly robust estimators relies on consistent estimation of at least one of two nuisance regression parameters. In moderate to large dimensions, the use of flexible data-adaptive regression estimators may aid in achieving this consistency. However, $n^{1/2}$-consistency of doubly robust estimators is not guaranteed if one of the nuisance estimators is inconsistent. In this paper we present a doubly robust estimator for survival analysis with the novel property that it converges to a Gaussian variable at $n^{1/2}$-rate for a large class of data-adaptive estimators of the nuisance parameters, under the only assumption that at least one of them is consistently estimated at a $n^{1/4}$-rate. This result is achieved through adaptation of recent ideas in semiparametric inference, which amount to: (i) Gaussianizing (i.e., making asymptotically linear) a drift term that arises in the asymptotic analysis of the doubly robust estimator, and (ii) using cross-fitting to avoid entropy conditions on the nuisance estimators. We present the formula of the asymptotic variance of the estimator, which allows computation of doubly robust confidence intervals and p-values. We illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimator in simulation studies, and demonstrate its use in a phase III clinical trial for estimating the effect of a novel therapy for the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer."}
{"text": "The interpretability of prediction mechanisms with respect to the underlying prediction problem is often unclear. While several studies have focused on developing prediction models with meaningful parameters, the causal relationships between the predictors and the actual prediction have not been considered. Here, we connect the underlying causal structure of a data generation process and the causal structure of a prediction mechanism. To achieve this, we propose a framework that identifies the feature with the greatest causal influence on the prediction and estimates the necessary causal intervention of a feature such that a desired prediction is obtained. The general concept of the framework has no restrictions regarding data linearity; however, we focus on an implementation for linear data here. The framework applicability is evaluated using artificial data and demonstrated using real-world data."}
{"text": "The small-ball method was introduced as a way of obtaining a high probability, isomorphic lower bound on the quadratic empirical process, under weak assumptions on the indexing class. The key assumption was that class members satisfy a uniform small-ball estimate: that $Pr(|f| \\geq \\kappa\\|f\\|_{L_2}) \\geq \\delta$ for given constants $\\kappa$ and $\\delta$.   Here we extend the small-ball method and obtain a high probability, almost-isometric (rather than isomorphic) lower bound on the quadratic empirical process. The scope of the result is considerably wider than the small-ball method: there is no need for class members to satisfy a uniform small-ball condition, and moreover, motivated by the notion of tournament learning procedures, the result is stable under a `majority vote'."}
{"text": "Two fundamental problems in unsupervised learning are efficient inference for latent-variable models and robust density estimation based on large amounts of unlabeled data. Algorithms for the two tasks, such as normalizing flows and generative adversarial networks (GANs), are often developed independently. In this paper, we propose the concept of {\\em continuous-time flows} (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling knowledge from a CTF for efficient inference, and learning an explicit energy-based distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Both tasks rely on a new technique for distribution matching within amortized learning. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related techniques."}
{"text": "Stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) has been developed as a flexible family of scalable Bayesian sampling algorithms. However, there has been little theoretical analysis of the impact of minibatch size to the algorithm's convergence rate. In this paper, we prove that under a limited computational budget/time, a larger minibatch size leads to a faster decrease of the mean squared error bound (thus the fastest one corresponds to using full gradients), which motivates the necessity of variance reduction in SG-MCMC. Consequently, by borrowing ideas from stochastic optimization, we propose a practical variance-reduction technique for SG-MCMC, that is efficient in both computation and storage. We develop theory to prove that our algorithm induces a faster convergence rate than standard SG-MCMC. A number of large-scale experiments, ranging from Bayesian learning of logistic regression to deep neural networks, validate the theory and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed variance-reduction SG-MCMC framework."}
{"text": "To solve key biomedical problems, experimentalists now routinely measure millions or billions of features (dimensions) per sample, with the hope that data science techniques will be able to build accurate data-driven inferences. Because sample sizes are typically orders of magnitude smaller than the dimensionality of these data, valid inferences require finding a low-dimensional representation that preserves the discriminating information (e.g., whether the individual suffers from a particular disease). Existing linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods either are not supervised, scale poorly to operate in big data regimes, lack theoretical guarantees, or are \"black-box\" methods unsuitable for many applications. We introduce \"Linear Optimal Low-rank\" projection (LOL), which extends principle components analysis by incorporating, rather than ignoring, class labels, and facilitates straightforward generalizations. We prove, and substantiate with both synthetic and real data benchmarks, that LOL leads to an improved data representation for subsequent classification, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. Using multiple brain imaging datasets consisting of >150 million features, and several genomics datasets with >500,000 features, LOL achieves achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy, while only requiring a few minutes on a standard desktop computer."}
{"text": "Reliable uncertainty estimation for time series prediction is critical in many fields, including physics, biology, and manufacturing. At Uber, probabilistic time series forecasting is used for robust prediction of number of trips during special events, driver incentive allocation, as well as real-time anomaly detection across millions of metrics. Classical time series models are often used in conjunction with a probabilistic formulation for uncertainty estimation. However, such models are hard to tune, scale, and add exogenous variables to. Motivated by the recent resurgence of Long Short Term Memory networks, we propose a novel end-to-end Bayesian deep model that provides time series prediction along with uncertainty estimation. We provide detailed experiments of the proposed solution on completed trips data, and successfully apply it to large-scale time series anomaly detection at Uber."}
{"text": "The ability of many powerful machine learning algorithms to deal with large data sets without compromise is often hampered by computationally expensive linear algebra tasks, of which calculating the log determinant is a canonical example. In this paper we demonstrate the optimality of Maximum Entropy methods in approximating such calculations. We prove the equivalence between mean value constraints and sample expectations in the big data limit, that Covariance matrix eigenvalue distributions can be completely defined by moment information and that the reduction of the self entropy of a maximum entropy proposal distribution, achieved by adding more moments reduces the KL divergence between the proposal and true eigenvalue distribution. We empirically verify our results on a variety of SparseSuite matrices and establish best practices."}
{"text": "We propose a new framework for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) on truncated probability distributions with smooth underlying density functions. Traditional HMC requires computing the gradient of potential function associated with the target distribution, and therefore does not perform its full power on truncated distributions due to lack of continuity and differentiability. In our framework, we introduce a sharp sigmoid factor in the density function to approximate the probability drop at the truncation boundary. The target potential function is approximated by a new potential which smoothly extends to the entire sample space. HMC is then performed on the approximate potential. While our method is easy to implement and applies to a wide range of problems, it also achieves comparable computational efficiency on various sampling tasks compared to other baseline methods. RBHMC also gives rise to a new approach for Bayesian inference on constrained spaces."}
{"text": "Discovering a correlation from one variable to another variable is of fundamental scientific and practical interest. While existing correlation measures are suitable for discovering average correlation, they fail to discover hidden or potential correlations. To bridge this gap, (i) we postulate a set of natural axioms that we expect a measure of potential correlation to satisfy; (ii) we show that the rate of information bottleneck, i.e., the hypercontractivity coefficient, satisfies all the proposed axioms; (iii) we provide a novel estimator to estimate the hypercontractivity coefficient from samples; and (iv) we provide numerical experiments demonstrating that this proposed estimator discovers potential correlations among various indicators of WHO datasets, is robust in discovering gene interactions from gene expression time series data, and is statistically more powerful than the estimators for other correlation measures in binary hypothesis testing of canonical examples of potential correlations."}
{"text": "In the multiple linear regression setting, we propose a general framework, termed weighted orthogonal components regression (WOCR), which encompasses many known methods as special cases, including ridge regression and principal components regression. WOCR makes use of the monotonicity inherent in orthogonal components to parameterize the weight function. The formulation allows for efficient determination of tuning parameters and hence is computationally advantageous. Moreover, WOCR offers insights for deriving new better variants. Specifically, we advocate weighting components based on their correlations with the response, which leads to enhanced predictive performance. Both simulated studies and real data examples are provided to assess and illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods."}
{"text": "Assessing heterogeneous treatment effects has become a growing interest in advancing precision medicine. Individualized treatment effects (ITE) play a critical role in such an endeavor. Concerning experimental data collected from randomized trials, we put forward a method, termed random forests of interaction trees (RFIT), for estimating ITE on the basis of interaction trees (Su et al., 2009). To this end, we first propose a smooth sigmoid surrogate (SSS) method, as an alternative to greedy search, to speed up tree construction. RFIT outperforms the traditional `separate regression' approach in estimating ITE. Furthermore, standard errors for the estimated ITE via RFIT can be obtained with the infinitesimal jackknife method. We assess and illustrate the use of RFIT via both simulation and the analysis of data from an acupuncture headache trial."}
{"text": "To model high dimensional data, Gaussian methods are widely used since they remain tractable and yield parsimonious models by imposing strong assumptions on the data. Vine copulas are more flexible by combining arbitrary marginal distributions and (conditional) bivariate copulas. Yet, this adaptability is accompanied by sharply increasing computational effort as the dimension increases. The approach proposed in this paper overcomes this burden and makes the first step into ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence modeling by using a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we apply Gaussian methods to split datasets into feasibly small subsets and second, apply parsimonious and flexible vine copulas thereon. Finally, we reconcile them into one joint model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in moderate dimensions and showcase its ability to estimate ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence models in thousands of dimensions."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of sequentially making decisions that are rewarded by \"successes\" and \"failures\" which can be predicted through an unknown relationship that depends on a partially controllable vector of attributes for each instance. The learner takes an active role in selecting samples from the instance pool. The goal is to maximize the probability of success in either offline (training) or online (testing) phases. Our problem is motivated by real-world applications where observations are time-consuming and/or expensive. We develop a knowledge gradient policy using an online Bayesian linear classifier to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information of labeling each alternative. We provide a finite-time analysis of the estimated error and show that the maximum likelihood estimator based produced by the KG policy is consistent and asymptotically normal. We also show that the knowledge gradient policy is asymptotically optimal in an offline setting. This work further extends the knowledge gradient to the setting of contextual bandits. We report the results of a series of experiments that demonstrate its efficiency."}
{"text": "We compare two statistical models of three binary random variables. One is a mixture model and the other is a product of mixtures model called a restricted Boltzmann machine. Although the two models we study look different from their parametrizations, we show that they represent the same set of distributions on the interior of the probability simplex, and are equal up to closure. We give a semi-algebraic description of the model in terms of six binomial inequalities and obtain closed form expressions for the maximum likelihood estimates. We briefly discuss extensions to larger models."}
{"text": "We introduce a new approach to functional causal modeling from observational data, called Causal Generative Neural Networks (CGNN). CGNN leverages the power of neural networks to learn a generative model of the joint distribution of the observed variables, by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between generated and observed data. An approximate learning criterion is proposed to scale the computational cost of the approach to linear complexity in the number of observations. The performance of CGNN is studied throughout three experiments. Firstly, CGNN is applied to cause-effect inference, where the task is to identify the best causal hypothesis out of $X\\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\\rightarrow X$. Secondly, CGNN is applied to the problem of identifying v-structures and conditional independences. Thirdly, CGNN is applied to multivariate functional causal modeling: given a skeleton describing the direct dependences in a set of random variables $\\textbf{X} = [X_1, \\ldots, X_d]$, CGNN orients the edges in the skeleton to uncover the directed acyclic causal graph describing the causal structure of the random variables. On all three tasks, CGNN is extensively assessed on both artificial and real-world data, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art. Finally, CGNN is extended to handle the case of confounders, where latent variables are involved in the overall causal model."}
{"text": "Automatic Chemical Design is a framework for generating novel molecules with optimized properties. The original scheme, featuring Bayesian optimization over the latent space of a variational autoencoder, suffers from the pathology that it tends to produce invalid molecular structures. First, we demonstrate empirically that this pathology arises when the Bayesian optimization scheme queries latent points far away from the data on which the variational autoencoder has been trained. Secondly, by reformulating the search procedure as a constrained Bayesian optimization problem, we show that the effects of this pathology can be mitigated, yielding marked improvements in the validity of the generated molecules. We posit that constrained Bayesian optimization is a good approach for solving this class of training set mismatch in many generative tasks involving Bayesian optimization over the latent space of a variational autoencoder."}
{"text": "We consider a graphical model where a multivariate normal vector is associated with each node of the underlying graph and estimate the graphical structure. We minimize a loss function obtained by regressing the vector at each node on those at the remaining ones under a group penalty. We show that the proposed estimator can be computed by a fast convex optimization algorithm. We show that as the sample size increases, the estimated regression coefficients and the correct graphical structure are correctly estimated with probability tending to one. By extensive simulations, we show the superiority of the proposed method over comparable procedures. We apply the technique on two real datasets. The first one is to identify gene and protein networks showing up in cancer cell lines, and the second one is to reveal the connections among different industries in the US."}
{"text": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is very popular to perform dimension reduction. The selection of the number of significant components is essential but often based on some practical heuristics depending on the application. Only few works have proposed a probabilistic approach able to infer the number of significant components. To this purpose, this paper introduces a Bayesian nonparametric principal component analysis (BNP-PCA). The proposed model projects observations onto a random orthogonal basis which is assigned a prior distribution defined on the Stiefel manifold. The prior on factor scores involves an Indian buffet process to model the uncertainty related to the number of components. The parameters of interest as well as the nuisance parameters are finally inferred within a fully Bayesian framework via Monte Carlo sampling. A study of the (in-)consistence of the marginal maximum a posteriori estimator of the latent dimension is carried out. A new estimator of the subspace dimension is proposed. Moreover, for sake of statistical significance, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based on the posterior distribution of the principal components is used to refine this estimate.   The behaviour of the algorithm is first studied on various synthetic examples. Finally, the proposed BNP dimension reduction approach is shown to be easily yet efficiently coupled with clustering or latent factor models within a unique framework."}
{"text": "This paper investigates the theoretical foundations of metric learning, focused on three key questions that are not fully addressed in prior work: 1) we consider learning general low-dimensional (low-rank) metrics as well as sparse metrics; 2) we develop upper and lower (minimax)bounds on the generalization error; 3) we quantify the sample complexity of metric learning in terms of the dimension of the feature space and the dimension/rank of the underlying metric;4) we also bound the accuracy of the learned metric relative to the underlying true generative metric. All the results involve novel mathematical approaches to the metric learning problem, and lso shed new light on the special case of ordinal embedding (aka non-metric multidimensional scaling)."}
{"text": "Kernel-based learning algorithms are widely used in machine learning for problems that make use of the similarity between object pairs. Such algorithms first embed all data points into an alternative space, where the inner product between object pairs specifies their distance in the embedding space. Applying kernel methods to partially labeled datasets is a classical challenge in this regard, requiring that the distances between unlabeled pairs must somehow be learnt using the labeled data. In this independent study, I will summarize the work of G. Lanckriet et al.'s work on \"Learning the Kernel Matrix with Semidefinite Programming\" used in support vector machines (SVM) algorithms for the transduction problem. Throughout the report, I have provide alternative explanations / derivations / analysis related to this work which is designed to ease the understanding of the original article."}
{"text": "Bayesian graphical models are a useful tool for understanding dependence relationships among many variables, particularly in situations with external prior information. In high-dimensional settings, the space of possible graphs becomes enormous, rendering even state-of-the-art Bayesian stochastic search computationally infeasible. We propose a deterministic alternative to estimate Gaussian and Gaussian copula graphical models using an Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm, extending the EM approach from Bayesian variable selection to graphical model estimation. We show that the ECM approach enables fast posterior exploration under a sequence of mixture priors, and can incorporate multiple sources of information."}
{"text": "Stochastic principal component analysis (SPCA) has become a popular dimensionality reduction strategy for large, high-dimensional datasets. We derive a simplified algorithm, called Lazy SPCA, which has reduced computational complexity and is better suited for large-scale distributed computation. We prove that SPCA and Lazy SPCA find the same approximations to the principal subspace, and that the pairwise distances between samples in the lower-dimensional space is invariant to whether SPCA is executed lazily or not. Empirical studies find downstream predictive performance to be identical for both methods, and superior to random projections, across a range of predictive models (linear regression, logistic lasso, and random forests). In our largest experiment with 4.6 million samples, Lazy SPCA reduced 43.7 hours of computation to 9.9 hours. Overall, Lazy SPCA relies exclusively on matrix multiplications, besides an operation on a small square matrix whose size depends only on the target dimensionality."}
{"text": "As renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) penetrate the power grid at an accelerating speed, it is essential for operators to have accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) energy forecasting for efficient operations and planning. Generally, observed weather data are applied in the solar PV generation forecasting model while in practice the energy forecasting is based on forecasted weather data. In this paper, a study on the uncertainty in weather forecasting for the most commonly used weather variables is presented. The forecasted weather data for six days ahead is compared with the observed data and the results of analysis are quantified by statistical metrics. In addition, the most influential weather predictors in energy forecasting model are selected. The performance of historical and observed weather data errors is assessed using a solar PV generation forecasting model. Finally, a sensitivity test is performed to identify the influential weather variables whose accurate values can significantly improve the results of energy forecasting."}
{"text": "The edge partition model (EPM) is a fundamental Bayesian nonparametric model for extracting an overlapping structure from binary matrix. The EPM adopts a gamma process ($\\Gamma$P) prior to automatically shrink the number of active atoms. However, we empirically found that the model shrinkage of the EPM does not typically work appropriately and leads to an overfitted solution. An analysis of the expectation of the EPM's intensity function suggested that the gamma priors for the EPM hyperparameters disturb the model shrinkage effect of the internal $\\Gamma$P. In order to ensure that the model shrinkage effect of the EPM works in an appropriate manner, we proposed two novel generative constructions of the EPM: CEPM incorporating constrained gamma priors, and DEPM incorporating Dirichlet priors instead of the gamma priors. Furthermore, all DEPM's model parameters including the infinite atoms of the $\\Gamma$P prior could be marginalized out, and thus it was possible to derive a truly infinite DEPM (IDEPM) that can be efficiently inferred using a collapsed Gibbs sampler. We experimentally confirmed that the model shrinkage of the proposed models works well and that the IDEPM indicated state-of-the-art performance in generalization ability, link prediction accuracy, mixing efficiency, and convergence speed."}
{"text": "We consider the fundamental problem of inferring the causal direction between two univariate numeric random variables $X$ and $Y$ from observational data. The two-variable case is especially difficult to solve since it is not possible to use standard conditional independence tests between the variables.   To tackle this problem, we follow an information theoretic approach based on Kolmogorov complexity and use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to provide a practical solution. In particular, we propose a compression scheme to encode local and global functional relations using MDL-based regression. We infer $X$ causes $Y$ in case it is shorter to describe $Y$ as a function of $X$ than the inverse direction. In addition, we introduce Slope, an efficient linear-time algorithm that through thorough empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real world data we show outperforms the state of the art by a wide margin."}
{"text": "This paper presents a new approach to non-parametric cluster analysis called Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC). The idea is to identify the clustering structure by checking at different points and for different scales on departure from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure describes the clustering structure in terms of weights \\( w_{ij} \\) each of them measures the degree of local inhomogeneity for two neighbor local clusters using statistical tests of \"no gap\" between them. % The procedure starts from very local scale, then the parameter of locality grows by some factor at each step. The method is fully adaptive and does not require to specify the number of clusters or their structure. The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, the procedure is able to recover different clusters with sharp edges or manifold structure. The method is scalable and computationally feasible. An intensive numerical study shows a state-of-the-art performance of the method in various artificial examples and applications to text data. Our theoretical study states optimal sensitivity of AWC to local inhomogeneity."}
{"text": "This paper presents a technique for reduced-order Markov modeling for compact representation of time-series data. In this work, symbolic dynamics-based tools have been used to infer an approximate generative Markov model. The time-series data are first symbolized by partitioning the continuous measurement space of the signal and then, the discrete sequential data are modeled using symbolic dynamics. In the proposed approach, the size of temporal memory of the symbol sequence is estimated from spectral properties of the resulting stochastic matrix corresponding to a first-order Markov model of the symbol sequence. Then, hierarchical clustering is used to represent the states of the corresponding full-state Markov model to construct a reduced-order or size Markov model with a non-deterministic algebraic structure. Subsequently, the parameters of the reduced-order Markov model are identified from the original model by making use of a Bayesian inference rule. The final model is selected using information-theoretic criteria. The proposed concept is elucidated and validated on two different data sets as examples. The first example analyzes a set of pressure data from a swirl-stabilized combustor, where controlled protocols are used to induce flame instabilities. Variations in the complexity of the derived Markov model represent how the system operating condition changes from a stable to an unstable combustion regime. In the second example, the data set is taken from NASA's data repository for prognostics of bearings on rotating shafts. We show that, even with a very small state-space, the reduced-order models are able to achieve comparable performance and that the proposed approach provides flexibility in the selection of a final model for representation and learning."}
{"text": "We propose a Bayesian regression method that accounts for multi-way interactions of arbitrary orders among the predictor variables. Our model makes use of a factorization mechanism for representing the regression coefficients of interactions among the predictors, while the interaction selection is guided by a prior distribution on random hypergraphs, a construction which generalizes the Finite Feature Model. We present a posterior inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling, and establish posterior consistency of our regression model. Our method is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated data and demonstrated to be able to identify meaningful interactions in applications in genetics and retail demand forecasting."}
{"text": "High throughput screening of compounds (chemicals) is an essential part of drug discovery [7], involving thousands to millions of compounds, with the purpose of identifying candidate hits. Most statistical tools, including the industry standard B-score method, work on individual compound plates and do not exploit cross-plate correlation or statistical strength among plates. We present a new statistical framework for high throughput screening of compounds based on Bayesian nonparametric modeling. The proposed approach is able to identify candidate hits from multiple plates simultaneously, sharing statistical strength among plates and providing more robust estimates of compound activity. It can flexibly accommodate arbitrary distributions of compound activities and is applicable to any plate geometry. The algorithm provides a principled statistical approach for hit identification and false discovery rate control. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in hit identification sensitivity and specificity over the B-score method, which is highly sensitive to threshold choice. The framework is implemented as an efficient R extension package BHTSpack and is suitable for large scale data sets."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of reconstructing signals and images from periodic nonlinearities. For such problems, we design a measurement scheme that supports efficient reconstruction; moreover, our method can be adapted to extend to compressive sensing-based signal and image acquisition systems. Our techniques can be potentially useful for reducing the measurement complexity of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging systems, with little loss in reconstruction quality. Several numerical experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "Feature selection with high-dimensional data and a very small proportion of relevant features poses a severe challenge to standard statistical methods. We have developed a new approach (HARVEST) that is straightforward to apply, albeit somewhat computer-intensive. This algorithm can be used to pre-screen a large number of features to identify those that are potentially useful. The basic idea is to evaluate each feature in the context of many random subsets of other features. HARVEST is predicated on the assumption that an irrelevant feature can add no real predictive value, regardless of which other features are included in the subset. Motivated by this idea, we have derived a simple statistical test for feature relevance. Empirical analyses and simulations produced so far indicate that the HARVEST algorithm is highly effective in predictive analytics, both in science and business."}
{"text": "We present a new method for forecasting systems of multiple interrelated time series. The method learns the forecast models together with discovering leading indicators from within the system that serve as good predictors improving the forecast accuracy and a cluster structure of the predictive tasks around these. The method is based on the classical linear vector autoregressive model (VAR) and links the discovery of the leading indicators to inferring sparse graphs of Granger causality. We formulate a new constrained optimisation problem to promote the desired sparse structures across the models and the sharing of information amongst the learning tasks in a multi-task manner. We propose an algorithm for solving the problem and document on a battery of synthetic and real-data experiments the advantages of our new method over baseline VAR models as well as the state-of-the-art sparse VAR learning methods."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of solving a large-scale Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program. Such problems occur naturally in many scientific and web applications. Although there are efficient methods which tackle this problem, they are mostly not scalable. In this paper, we develop a method that transforms the quadratic constraint into a linear form by sampling a set of low-discrepancy points. The transformed problem can then be solved by applying any state-of-the-art large-scale quadratic programming solvers. We show the convergence of our approximate solution to the true solution as well as some finite sample error bounds. Experimental results are also shown to prove scalability as well as improved quality of approximation in practice."}
{"text": "Many machine learning problems can be characterized by mutual contamination models. In these problems, one observes several random samples from different convex combinations of a set of unknown base distributions and the goal is to infer these base distributions. This paper considers the general setting where the base distributions are defined on arbitrary probability spaces. We examine three popular machine learning problems that arise in this general setting: multiclass classification with label noise, demixing of mixed membership models, and classification with partial labels. In each case, we give sufficient conditions for identifiability and present algorithms for the infinite and finite sample settings, with associated performance guarantees."}
{"text": "This work constructs a hypothesis test for detecting whether an data-generating function $h: R^p \\rightarrow R$ belongs to a specific reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_0$ , where the structure of $\\mathcal{H}_0$ is only partially known. Utilizing the theory of reproducing kernels, we reduce this hypothesis to a simple one-sided score test for a scalar parameter, develop a testing procedure that is robust against the mis-specification of kernel functions, and also propose an ensemble-based estimator for the null model to guarantee test performance in small samples. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, we apply our test to the problem of detecting nonlinear interaction between groups of continuous features. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of our test under different data-generating functions and estimation strategies for the null model. Our results reveal interesting connections between notions in machine learning (model underfit/overfit) and those in statistical inference (i.e. Type I error/power of hypothesis test), and also highlight unexpected consequences of common model estimating strategies (e.g. estimating kernel hyperparameters using maximum likelihood estimation) on model inference."}
{"text": "A parametric point process model is developed, with modeling based on the assumption that sequential observations often share latent phenomena, while also possessing idiosyncratic effects. An alternating optimization method is proposed to learn a \"registered\" point process that accounts for shared structure, as well as \"warping\" functions that characterize idiosyncratic aspects of each observed sequence. Under reasonable constraints, in each iteration we update the sample-specific warping functions by solving a set of constrained nonlinear programming problems in parallel, and update the model by maximum likelihood estimation. The justifiability, complexity and robustness of the proposed method are investigated in detail, and the influence of sequence stitching on the learning results is examined empirically. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the method yields explainable point process models, achieving encouraging results compared to state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches are the state-of-the-art in various computer vision tasks, including face recognition. Considerable research effort is currently being directed towards further improving deep CNNs by focusing on more powerful model architectures and better learning techniques. However, studies systematically exploring the strengths and weaknesses of existing deep models for face recognition are still relatively scarce in the literature. In this paper, we try to fill this gap and study the effects of different covariates on the verification performance of four recent deep CNN models using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Specifically, we investigate the influence of covariates related to: image quality -- blur, JPEG compression, occlusion, noise, image brightness, contrast, missing pixels; and model characteristics -- CNN architecture, color information, descriptor computation; and analyze their impact on the face verification performance of AlexNet, VGG-Face, GoogLeNet, and SqueezeNet. Based on comprehensive and rigorous experimentation, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of the deep learning models, and present key areas for potential future research. Our results indicate that high levels of noise, blur, missing pixels, and brightness have a detrimental effect on the verification performance of all models, whereas the impact of contrast changes and compression artifacts is limited. It has been found that the descriptor computation strategy and color information does not have a significant influence on performance."}
{"text": "We lay theoretical foundations for new database release mechanisms that allow third-parties to construct consistent estimators of population statistics, while ensuring that the privacy of each individual contributing to the database is protected. The proposed framework rests on two main ideas. First, releasing (an estimate of) the kernel mean embedding of the data generating random variable instead of the database itself still allows third-parties to construct consistent estimators of a wide class of population statistics. Second, the algorithm can satisfy the definition of differential privacy by basing the released kernel mean embedding on entirely synthetic data points, while controlling accuracy through the metric available in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We describe two instantiations of the proposed framework, suitable under different scenarios, and prove theoretical results guaranteeing differential privacy of the resulting algorithms and the consistency of estimators constructed from their outputs."}
{"text": "Uncertainty analysis in the form of probabilistic forecasting can significantly improve decision making processes in the smart power grid for better integrating renewable energy sources such as wind. Whereas point forecasting provides a single expected value, probabilistic forecasts provide more information in the form of quantiles, prediction intervals, or full predictive densities. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of a novel approach for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power that combines a smooth approximation of the pinball loss function with a neural network architecture and a weighting initialization scheme to prevent the quantile cross over problem. A numerical case study is conducted using publicly available wind data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. Multiple quantiles are estimated to form 10%, to 90% prediction intervals which are evaluated using a quantile score and reliability measures. Benchmark models such as the persistence and climatology distributions, multiple quantile regression, and support vector quantile regression are used for comparison where results demonstrate the proposed approach leads to improved performance while preventing the problem of overlapping quantile estimates."}
{"text": "Inferring predictive maps between multiple input and multiple output variables or tasks has innumerable applications in data science. Multi-task learning attempts to learn the maps to several output tasks simultaneously with information sharing between them. We propose a novel multi-task learning framework for sparse linear regression, where a full task hierarchy is automatically inferred from the data, with the assumption that the task parameters follow a hierarchical tree structure. The leaves of the tree are the parameters for individual tasks, and the root is the global model that approximates all the tasks. We apply the proposed approach to develop and evaluate: (a) predictive models of plant traits using large-scale and automated remote sensing data, and (b) GWAS methodologies mapping such derived phenotypes in lieu of hand-measured traits. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to other methods, as well as the usefulness of discovering hierarchical groupings between tasks. Our results suggest that richer genetic mapping can indeed be obtained from the remote sensing data. In addition, our discovered groupings reveal interesting insights from a plant science perspective."}
{"text": "Understanding player behavior is fundamental in game data science. Video games evolve as players interact with the game, so being able to foresee player experience would help to ensure a successful game development. In particular, game developers need to evaluate beforehand the impact of in-game events. Simulation optimization of these events is crucial to increase player engagement and maximize monetization. We present an experimental analysis of several methods to forecast game-related variables, with two main aims: to obtain accurate predictions of in-app purchases and playtime in an operational production environment, and to perform simulations of in-game events in order to maximize sales and playtime. Our ultimate purpose is to take a step towards the data-driven development of games. The results suggest that, even though the performance of traditional approaches such as ARIMA is still better, the outcomes of state-of-the-art techniques like deep learning are promising. Deep learning comes up as a well-suited general model that could be used to forecast a variety of time series with different dynamic behaviors."}
{"text": "The emergence of mobile games has caused a paradigm shift in the video-game industry. Game developers now have at their disposal a plethora of information on their players, and thus can take advantage of reliable models that can accurately predict player behavior and scale to huge datasets. Churn prediction, a challenge common to a variety of sectors, is particularly relevant for the mobile game industry, as player retention is crucial for the successful monetization of a game. In this article, we present an approach to predicting game abandon based on survival ensembles. Our method provides accurate predictions on both the level at which each player will leave the game and their accumulated playtime until that moment. Further, it is robust to different data distributions and applicable to a wide range of response variables, while also allowing for efficient parallelization of the algorithm. This makes our model well suited to perform real-time analyses of churners, even for games with millions of daily active users."}
{"text": "Reducing user attrition, i.e. churn, is a broad challenge faced by several industries. In mobile social games, decreasing churn is decisive to increase player retention and rise revenues. Churn prediction models allow to understand player loyalty and to anticipate when they will stop playing a game. Thanks to these predictions, several initiatives can be taken to retain those players who are more likely to churn.   Survival analysis focuses on predicting the time of occurrence of a certain event, churn in our case. Classical methods, like regressions, could be applied only when all players have left the game. The challenge arises for datasets with incomplete churning information for all players, as most of them still connect to the game. This is called a censored data problem and is in the nature of churn. Censoring is commonly dealt with survival analysis techniques, but due to the inflexibility of the survival statistical algorithms, the accuracy achieved is often poor. In contrast, novel ensemble learning techniques, increasingly popular in a variety of scientific fields, provide high-class prediction results.   In this work, we develop, for the first time in the social games domain, a survival ensemble model which provides a comprehensive analysis together with an accurate prediction of churn. For each player, we predict the probability of churning as function of time, which permits to distinguish various levels of loyalty profiles. Additionally, we assess the risk factors that explain the predicted player survival times. Our results show that churn prediction by survival ensembles significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of traditional analyses, like Cox regression."}
{"text": "We propose new algorithms for topic modeling when the number of topics is unknown. Our approach relies on an analysis of the concentration of mass and angular geometry of the topic simplex, a convex polytope constructed by taking the convex hull of vertices representing the latent topics. Our algorithms are shown in practice to have accuracy comparable to a Gibbs sampler in terms of topic estimation, which requires the number of topics be given. Moreover, they are one of the fastest among several state of the art parametric techniques. Statistical consistency of our estimator is established under some conditions."}
{"text": "Identifying changes in the generative process of sequential data, known as changepoint detection, has become an increasingly important topic for a wide variety of fields. A recently developed approach, which we call EXact Online Bayesian Changepoint Detection (EXO), has shown reasonable results with efficient computation for real time updates. The method is based on a \\textit{forward} recursive message-passing algorithm. However, the detected changepoints from these methods are unstable. We propose a new algorithm called Lagged EXact Online Bayesian Changepoint Detection (LEXO) that improves the accuracy and stability of the detection by incorporating $\\ell$-time lags to the inference. The new algorithm adds a recursive \\textit{backward} step to the forward EXO and has computational complexity linear in the number of added lags. Estimation of parameters associated with regimes is also developed. Simulation studies with three common changepoint models show that the detected changepoints from LEXO are much more stable and parameter estimates from LEXO have considerably lower MSE than EXO. We illustrate applicability of the methods with two real world data examples comparing the EXO and LEXO."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose a framework for automatic classification of patients from multimodal genetic and brain imaging data by optimally combining them. Additive models with unadapted penalties (such as the classical group lasso penalty or $L_1$-multiple kernel learning) treat all modalities in the same manner and can result in undesirable elimination of specific modalities when their contributions are unbalanced. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multilevel model that combines imaging and genetics and that considers joint effects between these two modalities for diagnosis prediction. Furthermore, we propose a framework allowing to combine several penalties taking into account the structure of the different types of data, such as a group lasso penalty over the genetic modality and a $L_2$-penalty on imaging modalities. Finally , we propose a fast optimization algorithm, based on a proximal gradient method. The model has been evaluated on genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms-SNP) and imaging (anatomical MRI measures) data from the ADNI database, and compared to additive models. It exhibits good performances in AD diagnosis; and at the same time, reveals relationships between genes, brain regions and the disease status."}
{"text": "Reliable measures of statistical dependence could be useful tools for learning independent features and performing tasks like source separation using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Unfortunately, many of such measures, like the mutual information, are hard to estimate and optimize directly. We propose to learn independent features with adversarial objectives which optimize such measures implicitly. These objectives compare samples from the joint distribution and the product of the marginals without the need to compute any probability densities. We also propose two methods for obtaining samples from the product of the marginals using either a simple resampling trick or a separate parametric distribution. Our experiments show that this strategy can easily be applied to different types of model architectures and solve both linear and non-linear ICA problems."}
{"text": "We introduce a methodology for efficiently computing a lower bound to empowerment, allowing it to be used as an unsupervised cost function for policy learning in real-time control. Empowerment, being the channel capacity between actions and states, maximises the influence of an agent on its near future. It has been shown to be a good model of biological behaviour in the absence of an extrinsic goal. But empowerment is also prohibitively hard to compute, especially in nonlinear continuous spaces. We introduce an efficient, amortised method for learning empowerment-maximising policies. We demonstrate that our algorithm can reliably handle continuous dynamical systems using system dynamics learned from raw data. The resulting policies consistently drive the agents into states where they can use their full potential."}
{"text": "The superposition of temporal point processes has been studied for many years, although the usefulness of such models for practical applications has not be fully developed. We investigate superposed Hawkes process as an important class of such models, with properties studied in the framework of least squares estimation. The superposition of Hawkes processes is demonstrated to be beneficial for tightening the upper bound of excess risk under certain conditions, and we show the feasibility of the benefit in typical situations. The usefulness of superposed Hawkes processes is verified on synthetic data, and its potential to solve the cold-start problem of recommendation systems is demonstrated on real-world data."}
{"text": "The modified Cholesky decomposition is commonly used for precision matrix estimation given a specified order of random variables. However, the order of variables is often not available or cannot be pre-determined. In this work, we propose to address the variable order issue in the modified Cholesky decomposition for sparse precision matrix estimation. The key idea is to effectively combine a set of estimates obtained from multiple permutations of variable orders, and to efficiently encourage the sparse structure for the resultant estimate by the thresholding technique on the ensemble Cholesky factor matrix. The consistent property of the proposed estimate is established under some weak regularity conditions. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with several existing approaches. The proposed method is also applied into linear discriminant analysis of real data for classification."}
{"text": "This paper considers the problem of brain disease classification based on connectome data. A connectome is a network representation of a human brain. The typical connectome classification problem is very challenging because of the small sample size and high dimensionality of the data. We propose to use simultaneous approximate diagonalization of adjacency matrices in order to compute their eigenstructures in more stable way. The obtained approximate eigenvalues are further used as features for classification. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be efficient for detection of Alzheimer's disease, outperforming simple baselines and competing with state-of-the-art approaches to brain disease classification."}
{"text": "We propose the first fully-adaptive algorithm for pure exploration in linear bandits---the task to find the arm with the largest expected reward, which depends on an unknown parameter linearly. While existing methods partially or entirely fix sequences of arm selections before observing rewards, our method adaptively changes the arm selection strategy based on past observations at each round. We show our sample complexity matches the achievable lower bound up to a constant factor in an extreme case. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the methods by simulations based on both synthetic setting and real-world data, in which our method shows vast improvement over existing methods."}
{"text": "New social and economic activities massively exploit big data and machine learning algorithms to do inference on people's lives. Applications include automatic curricula evaluation, wage determination, and risk assessment for credits and loans. Recently, many governments and institutions have raised concerns about the lack of fairness, equity and ethics in machine learning to treat these problems. It has been shown that not including sensitive features that bias fairness, such as gender or race, is not enough to mitigate the discrimination when other related features are included. Instead, including fairness in the objective function has been shown to be more efficient.   We present novel fair regression and dimensionality reduction methods built on a previously proposed fair classification framework. Both methods rely on using the Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion as the fairness term. Unlike previous approaches, this allows us to simplify the problem and to use multiple sensitive variables simultaneously. Replacing the linear formulation by kernel functions allows the methods to deal with nonlinear problems. For both linear and nonlinear formulations the solution reduces to solving simple matrix inversions or generalized eigenvalue problems. This simplifies the evaluation of the solutions for different trade-off values between the predictive error and fairness terms. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methods in toy examples, and evaluate their performance on real world datasets to predict income using gender and/or race discrimination as sensitive variables, and contraceptive method prediction under demographic and socio-economic sensitive descriptors."}
{"text": "Time series forecasting is widely used in a multitude of domains. In this paper, we present four models to predict the stock price using the SPX index as input time series data. The martingale and ordinary linear models require the strongest assumption in stationarity which we use as baseline models. The generalized linear model requires lesser assumptions but is unable to outperform the martingale. In empirical testing, the RNN model performs the best comparing to other two models, because it will update the input through LSTM instantaneously, but also does not beat the martingale. In addition, we introduce an online to batch algorithm and discrepancy measure to inform readers the newest research in time series predicting method, which doesn't require any stationarity or non mixing assumptions in time series data. Finally, to apply these forecasting to practice, we introduce basic trading strategies that can create Win win and Zero sum situations."}
{"text": "In machine learning and data mining, linear models have been widely used to model the response as parametric linear functions of the predictors. To relax such stringent assumptions made by parametric linear models, additive models consider the response to be a summation of unknown transformations applied on the predictors; in particular, additive isotonic models (AIMs) assume the unknown transformations to be monotone. In this paper, we introduce sparse linear isotonic models (SLIMs) for highdimensional problems by hybridizing ideas in parametric sparse linear models and AIMs, which enjoy a few appealing advantages over both. In the high-dimensional setting, a two-step algorithm is proposed for estimating the sparse parameters as well as the monotone functions over predictors. Under mild statistical assumptions, we show that the algorithm can accurately estimate the parameters. Promising preliminary experiments are presented to support the theoretical results."}
{"text": "We consider a novel stochastic multi-armed bandit problem called {\\em good arm identification} (GAI), where a good arm is defined as an arm with expected reward greater than or equal to a given threshold. GAI is a pure-exploration problem that a single agent repeats a process of outputting an arm as soon as it is identified as a good one before confirming the other arms are actually not good. The objective of GAI is to minimize the number of samples for each process. We find that GAI faces a new kind of dilemma, the {\\em exploration-exploitation dilemma of confidence}, which is different difficulty from the best arm identification. As a result, an efficient design of algorithms for GAI is quite different from that for the best arm identification. We derive a lower bound on the sample complexity of GAI that is tight up to the logarithmic factor $\\mathrm{O}(\\log \\frac{1}{\\delta})$ for acceptance error rate $\\delta$. We also develop an algorithm whose sample complexity almost matches the lower bound. We also confirm experimentally that our proposed algorithm outperforms naive algorithms in synthetic settings based on a conventional bandit problem and clinical trial researches for rheumatoid arthritis."}
{"text": "Robustness to outliers is a central issue in real-world machine learning applications. While replacing a model to a heavy-tailed one (e.g., from Gaussian to Student-t) is a standard approach for robustification, it can only be applied to simple models. In this paper, based on Zellner's optimization and variational formulation of Bayesian inference, we propose an outlier-robust pseudo-Bayesian variational method by replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence used for data fitting to a robust divergence such as the beta- and gamma-divergences. An advantage of our approach is that superior but complex models such as deep networks can also be handled. We theoretically prove that, for deep networks with ReLU activation functions, the \\emph{influence function} in our proposed method is bounded, while it is unbounded in the ordinary variational inference. This implies that our proposed method is robust to both of input and output outliers, while the ordinary variational method is not. We experimentally demonstrate that our robust variational method outperforms ordinary variational inference in regression and classification with deep networks."}
{"text": "Tensor decomposition methods are popular tools for learning latent variables given only lower-order moments of the data. However, the standard assumption is that we have sufficient data to estimate these moments to high accuracy. In this work, we consider the case in which certain dimensions of the data are not always observed---common in applied settings, where not all measurements may be taken for all observations---resulting in moment estimates of varying quality. We derive a weighted tensor decomposition approach that is computationally as efficient as the non-weighted approach, and demonstrate that it outperforms methods that do not appropriately leverage these less-observed dimensions."}
{"text": "The inverse covariance matrix provides considerable insight for understanding statistical models in the multivariate setting. In particular, when the distribution over variables is assumed to be multivariate normal, the sparsity pattern in the inverse covariance matrix, commonly referred to as the precision matrix, corresponds to the adjacency matrix representation of the Gauss-Markov graph, which encodes conditional independence statements between variables. Minimax results under the spectral norm have previously been established for covariance matrices, both sparse and banded, and for sparse precision matrices. We establish minimax estimation bounds for estimating banded precision matrices under the spectral norm. Our results greatly improve upon the existing bounds; in particular, we find that the minimax rate for estimating banded precision matrices matches that of estimating banded covariance matrices. The key insight in our analysis is that we are able to obtain barely-noisy estimates of $k \\times k$ subblocks of the precision matrix by inverting slightly wider blocks of the empirical covariance matrix along the diagonal. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments demonstrating the sharpness of our bounds."}
{"text": "The characteristics (or numerical patterns) of a feature vector in the transform domain of a perturbation model differ significantly from those of its corresponding feature vector in the input domain. These differences - caused by the perturbation techniques used for the transformation of feature patterns - degrade the performance of machine learning techniques in the transform domain. In this paper, we proposed a nonlinear parametric perturbation model that transforms the input feature patterns to a set of elliptical patterns, and studied the performance degradation issues associated with random forest classification technique using both the input and transform domain features. Compared with the linear transformation such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the proposed method requires less statistical assumptions and is highly suitable for the applications such as data privacy and security due to the difficulty of inverting the elliptical patterns from the transform domain to the input domain. In addition, we adopted a flexible block-wise dimensionality reduction step in the proposed method to accommodate the possible high-dimensional data in modern applications. We evaluated the empirical performance of the proposed method on a network intrusion data set and a biological data set, and compared the results with PCA in terms of classification performance and data privacy protection (measured by the blind source separation attack and signal interference ratio). Both results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed elliptical transformation."}
{"text": "In this paper, the problem of one-bit compressed sensing (OBCS) is formulated as a problem in probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. It is shown that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC-) dimension of the set of half-spaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ generated by $k$-sparse vectors is bounded below by $k \\lg (n/k)$ and above by $2k \\lg (n/k)$, plus some round-off terms. By coupling this estimate with well-established results in PAC learning theory, we show that a consistent algorithm can recover a $k$-sparse vector with $O(k \\lg (n/k))$ measurements, given only the signs of the measurement vector. This result holds for \\textit{all} probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. It is further shown that random sign-flipping errors result only in an increase in the constant in the $O(k \\lg (n/k))$ estimate. Because constructing a consistent algorithm is not straight-forward, we present a heuristic based on the $\\ell_1$-norm support vector machine, and illustrate that its computational performance is superior to a currently popular method."}
{"text": "We propose and analyze two new MCMC sampling algorithms, the Vaidya walk and the John walk, for generating samples from the uniform distribution over a polytope. Both random walks are sampling algorithms derived from interior point methods. The former is based on volumetric-logarithmic barrier introduced by Vaidya whereas the latter uses John's ellipsoids. We show that the Vaidya walk mixes in significantly fewer steps than the logarithmic-barrier based Dikin walk studied in past work. For a polytope in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by $n >d$ linear constraints, we show that the mixing time from a warm start is bounded as $\\mathcal{O}(n^{0.5}d^{1.5})$, compared to the $\\mathcal{O}(nd)$ mixing time bound for the Dikin walk. The cost of each step of the Vaidya walk is of the same order as the Dikin walk, and at most twice as large in terms of constant pre-factors. For the John walk, we prove an $\\mathcal{O}(d^{2.5}\\cdot\\log^4(n/d))$ bound on its mixing time and conjecture that an improved variant of it could achieve a mixing time of $\\mathcal{O}(d^2\\cdot\\text{polylog}(n/d))$. Additionally, we propose variants of the Vaidya and John walks that mix in polynomial time from a deterministic starting point. The speed-up of the Vaidya walk over the Dikin walk are illustrated in numerical examples."}
{"text": "In this paper we present a technique for using the bootstrap to estimate the operating characteristics and their variability for certain types of ensemble methods. Bootstrapping a model can require a huge amount of work if the training data set is large. Fortunately in many cases the technique lets us determine the effect of infinite resampling without actually refitting a single model. We apply the technique to the study of meta-parameter selection for random forests. We demonstrate that alternatives to bootstrap aggregation and to considering \\sqrt{d} features to split each node, where d is the number of features, can produce improvements in predictive accuracy."}
{"text": "We introduce an approach based on the Givens representation for posterior inference in statistical models with orthogonal matrix parameters, such as factor models and probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA). We show how the Givens representation can be used to develop practical methods for transforming densities over the Stiefel manifold into densities over subsets of Euclidean space. We show how to deal with issues arising from the topology of the Stiefel manifold and how to inexpensively compute the change-of-measure terms. We introduce an auxiliary parameter approach that limits the impact of topological issues. We provide both analysis of our methods and numerical examples demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. We also discuss how our Givens representation can be used to define general classes of distributions over the space of orthogonal matrices. We then give demonstrations on several examples showing how the Givens approach performs in practice in comparison with other methods."}
{"text": "Many matching, tracking, sorting, and ranking problems require probabilistic reasoning about possible permutations, a set that grows factorially with dimension. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may enable efficient point estimation, but fully Bayesian inference poses a severe challenge in this high-dimensional, discrete space. To surmount this challenge, we start with the usual step of relaxing a discrete set (here, of permutation matrices) to its convex hull, which here is the Birkhoff polytope: the set of all doubly-stochastic matrices. We then introduce two novel transformations: first, an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope; second, a map that rounds points toward the vertices of the polytope. Both transformations include a temperature parameter that, in the limit, concentrates the densities on permutation matrices. We then exploit these transformations and reparameterization gradients to introduce variational inference over permutation matrices, and we demonstrate its utility in a series of experiments."}
{"text": "Understanding and developing a correlation measure that can detect general dependencies is not only imperative to statistics and machine learning, but also crucial to general scientific discovery in the big data age. In this paper, we establish a new framework that generalizes distance correlation --- a correlation measure that was recently proposed and shown to be universally consistent for dependence testing against all joint distributions of finite moments --- to the Multiscale Graph Correlation (MGC). By utilizing the characteristic functions and incorporating the nearest neighbor machinery, we formalize the population version of local distance correlations, define the optimal scale in a given dependency, and name the optimal local correlation as MGC. The new theoretical framework motivates a theoretically sound Sample MGC and allows a number of desirable properties to be proved, including the universal consistency, convergence and almost unbiasedness of the sample version. The advantages of MGC are illustrated via a comprehensive set of simulations with linear, nonlinear, univariate, multivariate, and noisy dependencies, where it loses almost no power in monotone dependencies while achieving better performance in general dependencies, compared to distance correlation and other popular methods."}
{"text": "Consider an unknown smooth function $f: [0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, and say we are given $n$ noisy$\\mod 1$ samples of $f$, i.e., $y_i = (f(x_i) + \\eta_i)\\mod 1$ for $x_i \\in [0,1]$, where $\\eta_i$ denotes noise. Given the samples $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^{n}$ our goal is to recover smooth, robust estimates of the clean samples $f(x_i) \\bmod 1$. We formulate a natural approach for solving this problem which works with representations of mod 1 values over the unit circle. This amounts to solving a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with non-convex constraints involving points lying on the unit circle. Our proposed approach is based on solving its relaxation which is a trust-region sub-problem, and hence solvable efficiently. We demonstrate its robustness to noise % of our approach via extensive simulations on several synthetic examples, and provide a detailed theoretical analysis."}
{"text": "This work presents a new classifier that is specifically designed to be fully interpretable. This technique determines the probability of a class outcome, based directly on probability assignments measured from the training data. The accuracy of the predicted probability can be improved by measuring more probability estimates from the training data to create a series expansion that refines the predicted probability. We use this work to classify four standard datasets and achieve accuracies comparable to that of Random Forests. Because this technique is interpretable by design, it is capable of determining the combinations of features that contribute to a particular classification probability for individual cases as well as the weightings of each of combination of features."}
{"text": "In this study we introduce a new technique for symbolic regression that guarantees global optimality. This is achieved by formulating a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) whose solution is a symbolic mathematical expression of minimum complexity that explains the observations. We demonstrate our approach by rediscovering Kepler's law on planetary motion using exoplanet data and Galileo's pendulum periodicity equation using experimental data."}
{"text": "We consider classifiers for high-dimensional data under the strongly spiked eigenvalue (SSE) model. We first show that high-dimensional data often have the SSE model. We consider a distance-based classifier using eigenstructures for the SSE model. We apply the noise reduction methodology to estimation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the SSE model. We create a new distance-based classifier by transforming data from the SSE model to the non-SSE model. We give simulation studies and discuss the performance of the new classifier. Finally, we demonstrate the new classifier by using microarray data sets."}
{"text": "Reduced modeling of a computationally demanding dynamical system aims at approximating its trajectories, while optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. In this work, we propose to achieve such an approximation by first embedding the trajectories in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which exhibits appealing approximation and computational capabilities, and then solving the associated reduced model problem. More specifically, we propose a new efficient algorithm for data-driven reduced modeling of non-linear dynamics based on linear approximations in a RKHS. This algorithm takes advantage of the closed-form solution of a low-rank constraint optimization problem while exploiting advantageously kernel-based computations. Reduced modeling with this algorithm reveals a gain in approximation accuracy, as shown by numerical simulations, and in complexity with respect to existing approaches."}
{"text": "This paper raises an implicit manifold learning perspective in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by studying how the support of the learned distribution, modelled as a submanifold $\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}$, perfectly match with $\\mathcal{M}_{r}$, the support of the real data distribution. We show that optimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence forces $\\mathcal{M}_{\\theta}$ to perfectly match with $\\mathcal{M}_{r}$, while optimizing Wasserstein distance does not. On the other hand, by comparing the gradients of the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Wasserstein distances ($W_1$ and $W_2^2$) in their primal forms, we conjecture that Wasserstein $W_2^2$ may enjoy desirable properties such as reduced mode collapse. It is therefore interesting to design new distances that inherit the best from both distances."}
{"text": "Deep generative models provide a systematic way to learn nonlinear data distributions, through a set of latent variables and a nonlinear \"generator\" function that maps latent points into the input space. The nonlinearity of the generator imply that the latent space gives a distorted view of the input space. Under mild conditions, we show that this distortion can be characterized by a stochastic Riemannian metric, and demonstrate that distances and interpolants are significantly improved under this metric. This in turn improves probability distributions, sampling algorithms and clustering in the latent space. Our geometric analysis further reveals that current generators provide poor variance estimates and we propose a new generator architecture with vastly improved variance estimates. Results are demonstrated on convolutional and fully connected variational autoencoders, but the formalism easily generalize to other deep generative models."}
{"text": "Many decisions in healthcare, business, and other policy domains are made without the support of rigorous evidence due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized experiments. Using observational data to answer causal questions is risky: subjects who receive different treatments also differ in other ways that affect outcomes. Many causal inference methods have been developed to mitigate these biases. However, there is no way to know which method might produce the best estimate of a treatment effect in a given study. In analogy to cross-validation, which estimates the prediction error of predictive models applied to a given dataset, we propose synth-validation, a procedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods applied to a given dataset. In synth-validation, we use the observed data to estimate generative distributions with known treatment effects. We apply each causal inference method to datasets sampled from these distributions and compare the effect estimates with the known effects to estimate error. Using simulations, we show that using synth-validation to select a causal inference method for each study lowers the expected estimation error relative to consistently using any single method."}
{"text": "This article carries out a large dimensional analysis of standard regularized discriminant analysis classifiers designed on the assumption that data arise from a Gaussian mixture model with different means and covariances. The analysis relies on fundamental results from random matrix theory (RMT) when both the number of features and the cardinality of the training data within each class grow large at the same pace. Under mild assumptions, we show that the asymptotic classification error approaches a deterministic quantity that depends only on the means and covariances associated with each class as well as the problem dimensions. Such a result permits a better understanding of the performance of regularized discriminant analsysis, in practical large but finite dimensions, and can be used to determine and pre-estimate the optimal regularization parameter that minimizes the misclassification error probability. Despite being theoretically valid only for Gaussian data, our findings are shown to yield a high accuracy in predicting the performances achieved with real data sets drawn from the popular USPS data base, thereby making an interesting connection between theory and practice."}
{"text": "Information-theoretic Bayesian optimisation techniques have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in tackling important global optimisation problems. However, current information-theoretic approaches require many approximations in implementation, introduce often-prohibitive computational overhead and limit the choice of kernels available to model the objective. We develop a fast information-theoretic Bayesian Optimisation method, FITBO, that avoids the need for sampling the global minimiser, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, in comparison with existing approaches, our method faces fewer constraints on kernel choice and enjoys the merits of dealing with the output space. We demonstrate empirically that FITBO inherits the performance associated with information-theoretic Bayesian optimisation, while being even faster than simpler Bayesian optimisation approaches, such as Expected Improvement."}
{"text": "Modeling sequential data has become more and more important in practice. Some applications are autonomous driving, virtual sensors and weather forecasting. To model such systems so called recurrent models are used. In this article we introduce two new Deep Recurrent Gaussian Process (DRGP) models based on the Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (SSGP) and the improved variational version called Variational Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (VSSGP). We follow the recurrent structure given by an existing DRGP based on a specific sparse Nystr\\\"om approximation. Therefore, we also variationally integrate out the input-space and hence can propagate uncertainty through the layers. We can show that for the resulting lower bound an optimal variational distribution exists. Training is realized through optimizing the variational lower bound. Using Distributed Variational Inference (DVI), we can reduce the computational complexity. We improve over current state of the art methods in prediction accuracy for experimental data-sets used for their evaluation and introduce a new data-set for engine control, named Emission. Furthermore, our method can easily be adapted for unsupervised learning, e.g. the latent variable model and its deep version."}
{"text": "Profiling cellular phenotypes from microscopic imaging can provide meaningful biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells. One motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be captured from images, from which similarities between different drug compounds applied at different doses can be quantified. The general approach is to find a function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for those from different weeks, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases. In this case, the particular batch in which a set of experiments were conducted constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant biological information. To achieve this, we minimize a loss function based on distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset we present results with, the only replicated treatment happens to be the negative control treatment, for which we do not expect any treatment-induced cell morphology changes. We find that for our transformed embeddings (i) the underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also carry improved biological signal; and (ii) less domain-specific information is present."}
{"text": "Sparse regularization such as $\\ell_1$ regularization is a quite powerful and widely used strategy for high dimensional learning problems. The effectiveness of sparse regularization has been supported practically and theoretically by several studies. However, one of the biggest issues in sparse regularization is that its performance is quite sensitive to correlations between features. Ordinary $\\ell_1$ regularization can select variables correlated with each other, which results in deterioration of not only its generalization error but also interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new regularization method, \"Independently Interpretable Lasso\" (IILasso). Our proposed regularizer suppresses selecting correlated variables, and thus each active variable independently affects the objective variable in the model. Hence, we can interpret regression coefficients intuitively and also improve the performance by avoiding overfitting. We analyze theoretical property of IILasso and show that the proposed method is much advantageous for its sign recovery and achieves almost minimax optimal convergence rate. Synthetic and real data analyses also indicate the effectiveness of IILasso."}
{"text": "A powerful approach for understanding neural population dynamics is to extract low-dimensional trajectories from population recordings using dimensionality reduction methods. Current approaches for dimensionality reduction on neural data are limited to single population recordings, and can not identify dynamics embedded across multiple measurements. We propose an approach for extracting low-dimensional dynamics from multiple, sequential recordings. Our algorithm scales to data comprising millions of observed dimensions, making it possible to access dynamics distributed across large populations or multiple brain areas. Building on subspace-identification approaches for dynamical systems, we perform parameter estimation by minimizing a moment-matching objective using a scalable stochastic gradient descent algorithm: The model is optimized to predict temporal covariations across neurons and across time. We show how this approach naturally handles missing data and multiple partial recordings, and can identify dynamics and predict correlations even in the presence of severe subsampling and small overlap between recordings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach both on simulated data and a whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging dataset."}
{"text": "Mechanistic models of single-neuron dynamics have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience. However, identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling."}
{"text": "Our goal is to extract meaningful transformations from raw images, such as varying the thickness of lines in handwriting or the lighting in a portrait. We propose an unsupervised approach to learn such transformations by attempting to reconstruct an image from a linear combination of transformations of its nearest neighbors. On handwritten digits and celebrity portraits, we show that even with linear transformations, our method generates visually high-quality modified images. Moreover, since our method is semiparametric and does not model the data distribution, the learned transformations extrapolate off the training data and can be applied to new types of images."}
{"text": "This paper presents a novel two-step approach for the fundamental problem of learning an optimal map from one distribution to another. First, we learn an optimal transport (OT) plan, which can be thought as a one-to-many map between the two distributions. To that end, we propose a stochastic dual approach of regularized OT, and show empirically that it scales better than a recent related approach when the amount of samples is very large. Second, we estimate a \\textit{Monge map} as a deep neural network learned by approximating the barycentric projection of the previously-obtained OT plan. This parameterization allows generalization of the mapping outside the support of the input measure. We prove two theoretical stability results of regularized OT which show that our estimations converge to the OT plan and Monge map between the underlying continuous measures. We showcase our proposed approach on two applications: domain adaptation and generative modeling."}
{"text": "Well-established methods for the solution of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) typically struggle in problems with high-dimensional inputs/outputs. Such difficulties are only amplified in large-scale applications where even a few tens of full-order model runs are impracticable. While dimensionality reduction can alleviate some of these issues, it is not known which and how many features of the (high-dimensional) input are actually predictive of the (high-dimensional) output. In this paper, we advocate a Bayesian formulation that is capable of performing simultaneous dimension and model-order reduction. It consists of a component that encodes the high-dimensional input into a low-dimensional set of feature functions by employing sparsity-enforcing priors and a decoding component that makes use of the solution of a coarse-grained model in order to reconstruct that of the full-order model. Both components are represented with latent variables in a probabilistic graphical model and are simultaneously trained using Stochastic Variational Inference methods. The model is capable of quantifying the predictive uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place in any model-order/dimension reduction as well as the uncertainty arising from finite-sized training datasets. We demonstrate its capabilities in the context of random media where fine-scale fluctuations can give rise to random inputs with tens of thousands of variables. With a few tens of full-order model simulations, the proposed model is capable of identifying salient physical features and produce sharp predictions under different boundary conditions of the full output which itself consists of thousands of components."}
{"text": "We establish the consistency of an algorithm of Mondrian Forests, a randomized classification algorithm that can be implemented online. First, we amend the original Mondrian Forest algorithm, that considers a fixed lifetime parameter. Indeed, the fact that this parameter is fixed hinders the statistical consistency of the original procedure. Our modified Mondrian Forest algorithm grows trees with increasing lifetime parameters $\\lambda_n$, and uses an alternative updating rule, allowing to work also in an online fashion. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis establishing simple conditions for consistency. Our theoretical analysis also exhibits a surprising fact: our algorithm achieves the minimax rate (optimal rate) for the estimation of a Lipschitz regression function, which is a strong extension of previous results to an arbitrary dimension."}
{"text": "Gaussian multiplicative noise is commonly used as a stochastic regularisation technique in training of deterministic neural networks. A recent paper reinterpreted the technique as a specific algorithm for approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks; several extensions ensued. We show that the log-uniform prior used in all the above publications does not generally induce a proper posterior, and thus Bayesian inference in such models is ill-posed. Independent of the log-uniform prior, the correlated weight noise approximation has further issues leading to either infinite objective or high risk of overfitting. The above implies that the reported sparsity of obtained solutions cannot be explained by Bayesian or the related minimum description length arguments. We thus study the objective from a non-Bayesian perspective, provide its previously unknown analytical form which allows exact gradient evaluation, and show that the later proposed additive reparametrisation introduces minima not present in the original multiplicative parametrisation. Implications and future research directions are discussed."}
{"text": "One iteration of standard $k$-means (i.e., Lloyd's algorithm) or standard EM for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) scales linearly with the number of clusters $C$, data points $N$, and data dimensionality $D$. In this study, we explore whether one iteration of $k$-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with $C$ at run-time, while improving the clustering objective remains effective. The tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is typically used to make training of generative models with exponentially many hidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical results on truncated variational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more efficient. The basic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ required for a full E-step to a sublinear complexity. Our main observation is that the linear dependency on $C$ can be reduced to a dependency on a much smaller parameter $G$ which relates to cluster neighborhood relations. We focus on two versions of partial variational EM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with $\\mathcal{O}(NG^2D)$, and variational $k$-means, scaling with $\\mathcal{O}(NGD)$ per iteration. Empirical results show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of iterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as $k$-means. For data with many clusters, we consequently observe reductions of net computational demands between two and three orders of magnitude. More generally, our results provide substantial empirical evidence in favor of clustering to scale sublinearly with $C$."}
{"text": "A novel Python framework for Bayesian optimization known as GPflowOpt is introduced. The package is based on the popular GPflow library for Gaussian processes, leveraging the benefits of TensorFlow including automatic differentiation, parallelization and GPU computations for Bayesian optimization. Design goals focus on a framework that is easy to extend with custom acquisition functions and models. The framework is thoroughly tested and well documented, and provides scalability. The current released version of GPflowOpt includes some standard single-objective acquisition functions, the state-of-the-art max-value entropy search, as well as a Bayesian multi-objective approach. Finally, it permits easy use of custom modeling strategies implemented in GPflow."}
{"text": "Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a recently proposed particle-based Bayesian inference method, which has attracted a lot of interest due to its remarkable approximation ability and particle efficiency compared to traditional variational inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. However, we observed that particles of SVGD tend to collapse to modes of the target distribution, and this particle degeneracy phenomenon becomes more severe with higher dimensions. Our theoretical analysis finds out that there exists a negative correlation between the dimensionality and the repulsive force of SVGD which should be blamed for this phenomenon. We propose Message Passing SVGD (MP-SVGD) to solve this problem. By leveraging the conditional independence structure of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), MP-SVGD converts the original high-dimensional global inference problem into a set of local ones over the Markov blanket with lower dimensions. Experimental results show its advantages of preventing vanishing repulsive force in high-dimensional space over SVGD, and its particle efficiency and approximation flexibility over other inference methods on graphical models."}
{"text": "Model criticism is usually carried out by assessing if replicated data generated under the fitted model looks similar to the observed data, see e.g. Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin [2004, p. 165]. This paper presents a method for latent variable models by pulling back the data into the space of latent variables, and carrying out model criticism in that space. Making use of a model's structure enables a more direct assessment of the assumptions made in the prior and likelihood. We demonstrate the method with examples of model criticism in latent space applied to factor analysis, linear dynamical systems and Gaussian processes."}
{"text": "Network clustering reveals the organization of a network or corresponding complex system with elements represented as vertices and interactions as edges in a (directed, weighted) graph. Although the notion of clustering can be somewhat loose, network clusters or groups are generally considered as nodes with enriched interactions and edges sharing common patterns. Statistical inference often treats groups as latent variables, with observed networks generated from latent group structure, termed a stochastic block model. Regardless of the definitions, statistical inference can be either translated to modularity maximization, which is provably an NP-complete problem.   Here we present scalable and reliable algorithms that recover hierarchical stochastic block models fast and accurately. Our algorithm scales almost linearly in number of edges, and inferred models were more accurate that other scalable methods."}
{"text": "A nonparametric family of conditional distributions is introduced, which generalizes conditional exponential families using functional parameters in a suitable RKHS. An algorithm is provided for learning the generalized natural parameter, and consistency of the estimator is established in the well specified case. In experiments, the new method generally outperforms a competing approach with consistency guarantees, and is competitive with a deep conditional density model on datasets that exhibit abrupt transitions and heteroscedasticity."}
{"text": "Given a vertex of interest in a network $G_1$, the vertex nomination problem seeks to find the corresponding vertex of interest (if it exists) in a second network $G_2$. A vertex nomination scheme produces a list of the vertices in $G_2$, ranked according to how likely they are judged to be the corresponding vertex of interest in $G_2$. The vertex nomination problem and related information retrieval tasks have attracted much attention in the machine learning literature, with numerous applications to social and biological networks. However, the current framework has often been confined to a comparatively small class of network models, and the concept of statistically consistent vertex nomination schemes has been only shallowly explored. In this paper, we extend the vertex nomination problem to a very general statistical model of graphs. Further, drawing inspiration from the long-established classification framework in the pattern recognition literature, we provide definitions for the key notions of Bayes optimality and consistency in our extended vertex nomination framework, including a derivation of the Bayes optimal vertex nomination scheme. In addition, we prove that no universally consistent vertex nomination schemes exist. Illustrative examples are provided throughout."}
{"text": "The use of covariance kernels is ubiquitous in the field of spatial statistics. Kernels allow data to be mapped into high-dimensional feature spaces and can thus extend simple linear additive methods to nonlinear methods with higher order interactions. However, until recently, there has been a strong reliance on a limited class of stationary kernels such as the Matern or squared exponential, limiting the expressiveness of these modelling approaches. Recent machine learning research has focused on spectral representations to model arbitrary stationary kernels and introduced more general representations that include classes of nonstationary kernels. In this paper, we exploit the connections between Fourier feature representations, Gaussian processes and neural networks to generalise previous approaches and develop a simple and efficient framework to learn arbitrarily complex nonstationary kernel functions directly from the data, while taking care to avoid overfitting using state-of-the-art methods from deep learning. We highlight the very broad array of kernel classes that could be created within this framework. We apply this to a time series dataset and a remote sensing problem involving land surface temperature in Eastern Africa. We show that without increasing the computational or storage complexity, nonstationary kernels can be used to improve generalisation performance and provide more interpretable results."}
{"text": "Recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective paradigm for human-powered large scale problem solving in various domains. However, task requester usually has a limited amount of budget, thus it is desirable to have a policy to wisely allocate the budget to achieve better quality. In this paper, we study the principle of information maximization for active sampling strategies in the framework of HodgeRank, an approach based on Hodge Decomposition of pairwise ranking data with multiple workers. The principle exhibits two scenarios of active sampling: Fisher information maximization that leads to unsupervised sampling based on a sequential maximization of graph algebraic connectivity without considering labels; and Bayesian information maximization that selects samples with the largest information gain from prior to posterior, which gives a supervised sampling involving the labels collected. Experiments show that the proposed methods boost the sampling efficiency as compared to traditional sampling schemes and are thus valuable to practical crowdsourcing experiments."}
{"text": "Compression of Neural Networks (NN) has become a highly studied topic in recent years. The main reason for this is the demand for industrial scale usage of NNs such as deploying them on mobile devices, storing them efficiently, transmitting them via band-limited channels and most importantly doing inference at scale. In this work, we propose to join the Soft-Weight Sharing and Variational Dropout approaches that show strong results to define a new state-of-the-art in terms of model compression."}
{"text": "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique for finding latent representations of data. The method has been applied to corpora to construct topic models. However, NMF has likelihood assumptions which are often violated by real document corpora. We present a double parametric bootstrap test for evaluating the fit of an NMF-based topic model based on the duality of the KL divergence and Poisson maximum likelihood estimation. The test correctly identifies whether a topic model based on an NMF approach yields reliable results in simulated and real data."}
{"text": "Inpatient care is a large share of total health care spending, making analysis of inpatient utilization patterns an important part of understanding what drives health care spending growth. Common features of inpatient utilization measures include zero inflation, over-dispersion, and skewness, all of which complicate statistical modeling. Mixture modeling is a popular approach that can accommodate these features of health care utilization data. In this work, we add a nonparametric clustering component to such models. Our fully Bayesian model framework allows for an unknown number of mixing components, so that the data determine the number of mixture components. When we apply the modeling framework to data on hospital lengths of stay for patients with lung cancer, we find distinct subgroups of patients with differences in means and variances of hospital days, health and treatment covariates, and relationships between covariates and length of stay."}
{"text": "This is a technical report which explores the estimation methodologies on hyper-parameters in Markov Random Field and Gaussian Hidden Markov Random Field. In first section, we briefly investigate a theoretical framework on Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Next, by using MH algorithm, we simulate the data from Ising model, and study on how hyper-parameter estimation in Ising model is enabled through MCMC algorithm using pseudo-likelihood approximation. Following section deals with an issue on parameters estimation process of Gaussian Hidden Markov Random Field using MAP estimation and EM algorithm, and also discusses problems, found through several experiments. In following section, we expand this idea on estimating parameters in Gaussian Hidden Markov Spatial-Temporal Random Field, and display results on two performed experiments."}
{"text": "The EM algorithm is one of many important tools in the field of statistics. While often used for imputing missing data, its widespread applications include other common statistical tasks, such as clustering. In clustering, the EM algorithm assumes a parametric distribution for the clusters, whose parameters are estimated through a novel iterative procedure that is based on the theory of maximum likelihood. However, one major drawback of the EM algorithm, that renders it impractical especially when working with large datasets, is that it often requires several passes of the data before convergence. In this paper, we introduce a new EM-style algorithm that implements a novel policy for performing partial E-steps. We call the new algorithm the EM-Tau algorithm, which can approximate the traditional EM algorithm with high accuracy but with only a fraction of the running time."}
{"text": "In the problem of domain generalization (DG), there are labeled training data sets from several related prediction problems, and the goal is to make accurate predictions on future unlabeled data sets that are not known to the learner. This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis.   This work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced Blanchard et al., 2011. We present two formal models of data generation, corresponding notions of risk, and distribution-free generalization error analysis. By focusing our attention on kernel methods, we also provide more quantitative results and a universally consistent algorithm. An efficient implementation is provided for this algorithm, which is experimentally compared to a pooling strategy on one synthetic and three real-world data sets."}
{"text": "Calls to arms to build interpretable models express a well-founded discomfort with machine learning. Should a software agent that does not even know what a loan is decide who qualifies for one? Indeed, we ought to be cautious about injecting machine learning (or anything else, for that matter) into applications where there may be a significant risk of causing social harm. However, claims that stakeholders \"just won't accept that!\" do not provide a sufficient foundation for a proposed field of study. For the field of interpretable machine learning to advance, we must ask the following questions: What precisely won't various stakeholders accept? What do they want? Are these desiderata reasonable? Are they feasible? In order to answer these questions, we'll have to give real-world problems and their respective stakeholders greater consideration."}
{"text": "Most research on the interpretability of machine learning systems focuses on the development of a more rigorous notion of interpretability. I suggest that a better understanding of the deficiencies of the intuitive notion of interpretability is needed as well. I show that visualization enables but also impedes intuitive interpretability, as it presupposes two levels of technical pre-interpretation: dimensionality reduction and regularization. Furthermore, I argue that the use of positive concepts to emulate the distributed semantic structure of machine learning models introduces a significant human bias into the model. As a consequence, I suggest that, if intuitive interpretability is needed, singular representations of internal model states should be avoided."}
{"text": "While most classical approaches to Granger causality detection repose upon linear time series assumptions, many interactions in neuroscience and economics applications are nonlinear. We develop an approach to nonlinear Granger causality detection using multilayer perceptrons where the input to the network is the past time lags of all series and the output is the future value of a single series. A sufficient condition for Granger non-causality in this setting is that all of the outgoing weights of the input data, the past lags of a series, to the first hidden layer are zero. For estimation, we utilize a group lasso penalty to shrink groups of input weights to zero. We also propose a hierarchical penalty for simultaneous Granger causality and lag estimation. We validate our approach on simulated data from both a sparse linear autoregressive model and the sparse and nonlinear Lorenz-96 model."}
{"text": "In this paper, a scale mixture of Normal distributions model is developed for classification and clustering of data having outliers and missing values. The classification method, based on a mixture model, focuses on the introduction of latent variables that gives us the possibility to handle sensitivity of model to outliers and to allow a less restrictive modelling of missing data. Inference is processed through a Variational Bayesian Approximation and a Bayesian treatment is adopted for model learning, supervised classification and clustering."}
{"text": "We present an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for segmenting a multivariate non-stationary time series with structural breaks into stationary regions. We draw from recent work where the series is assumed to follow a vector autoregressive model within segments and a convex estimation procedure may be formulated using group fused lasso penalties. Our ADMM approach first splits the convex problem into a global quadratic program and a simple group lasso proximal update. We show that the global problem may be parallelized over rows of the time dependent transition matrices and furthermore that each subproblem may be rewritten in a form identical to the log-likelihood of a Gaussian state space model. Consequently, we develop a Kalman smoothing algorithm to solve the global update in time linear in the length of the series."}
{"text": "The estimation of optimal treatment regimes is of considerable interest to precision medicine. In this work, we propose a causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to estimate the optimal treatment regime. The method roots in the framework of causal inference, and estimates the causal treatment effects within the nearest neighborhood. Although the method is simple, it possesses nice theoretical properties. We show that the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime is universally consistent. That is, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime will eventually learn the optimal treatment regime as the sample size increases. We also establish its convergence rate. However, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. performance deteriorates as dimensionality increases. To alleviate this problem, we develop an adaptive causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to perform metric selection and variable selection simultaneously. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in simulation studies and in an analysis of a chronic depression clinical trial."}
{"text": "Modern machine learning systems such as image classifiers rely heavily on large scale data sets for training. Such data sets are costly to create, thus in practice a small number of freely available, open source data sets are widely used. We suggest that examining the geo-diversity of open data sets is critical before adopting a data set for use cases in the developing world. We analyze two large, publicly available image data sets to assess geo-diversity and find that these data sets appear to exhibit an observable amerocentric and eurocentric representation bias. Further, we analyze classifiers trained on these data sets to assess the impact of these training distributions and find strong differences in the relative performance on images from different locales. These results emphasize the need to ensure geo-representation when constructing data sets for use in the developing world."}
{"text": "A modern aircraft may require on the order of thousands of custom shims to fill gaps between structural components in the airframe that arise due to manufacturing tolerances adding up across large structures. These shims are necessary to eliminate gaps, maintain structural performance, and minimize pull-down forces required to bring the aircraft into engineering nominal configuration for peak aerodynamic efficiency. Gap filling is a time-consuming process, involving either expensive by-hand inspection or computations on vast quantities of measurement data from increasingly sophisticated metrology equipment. Either case amounts to significant delays in production, with much of the time spent in the critical path of aircraft assembly. This work presents an alternative strategy for predictive shimming, based on machine learning and sparse sensing to first learn gap distributions from historical data, and then design optimized sparse sensing strategies to streamline data collection and processing. This new approach is based on the assumption that patterns exist in shim distributions across aircraft, which may be mined and used to reduce the burden of data collection and processing in future aircraft. Specifically, robust principal component analysis is used to extract low-dimensional patterns in the gap measurements while rejecting outliers. Next, optimized sparse sensors are obtained that are most informative about the dimensions of a new aircraft in these low-dimensional principal components. We demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, called PIXel Identification Despite Uncertainty in Sensor Technology (PIXI-DUST), on historical production data from 54 representative Boeing commercial aircraft. Our algorithm successfully predicts $99\\%$ of shim gaps within the desired measurement tolerance using $3\\%$ of the laser scan points typically required; all results are cross-validated."}
{"text": "We present Causal Generative Neural Networks (CGNNs) to learn functional causal models from observational data. CGNNs leverage conditional independencies and distributional asymmetries to discover bivariate and multivariate causal structures. CGNNs make no assumption regarding the lack of confounders, and learn a differentiable generative model of the data by using backpropagation. Extensive experiments show their good performances comparatively to the state of the art in observational causal discovery on both simulated and real data, with respect to cause-effect inference, v-structure identification, and multivariate causal discovery."}
{"text": "This paper investigates asymptotic behaviors of gradient descent algorithms (particularly accelerated gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent) in the context of stochastic optimization arising in statistics and machine learning where objective functions are estimated from available data. We show that these algorithms can be computationally modeled by continuous-time ordinary or stochastic differential equations. We establish gradient flow central limit theorems to describe the limiting dynamic behaviors of these computational algorithms and the large-sample performances of the related statistical procedures, as the number of algorithm iterations and data size both go to infinity, where the gradient flow central limit theorems are governed by some linear ordinary or stochastic differential equations like time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We illustrate that our study can provide a novel unified framework for a joint computational and statistical asymptotic analysis, where the computational asymptotic analysis studies dynamic behaviors of these algorithms with the time (or the number of iterations in the algorithms), the statistical asymptotic analysis investigates large sample behaviors of the statistical procedures (like estimators and classifiers) that the algorithms are applied to compute, and in fact the statistical procedures are equal to the limits of the random sequences generated from these iterative algorithms as the number of iterations goes to infinity. The joint analysis results based on the obtained gradient flow central limit theorems can identify four factors - learning rate, batch size, gradient covariance, and Hessian - to derive new theory regarding the local minima found by stochastic gradient descent for solving non-convex optimization problems."}

{"text": "In many problem settings, parameter vectors are not merely sparse but dependent in such a way that non-zero coefficients tend to cluster together. We refer to this form of dependency as \"region sparsity.\" Classical sparse regression methods, such as the lasso and automatic relevance determination (ARD), which model parameters as independent a priori, and therefore do not exploit such dependencies. Here we introduce a hierarchical model for smooth, region-sparse weight vectors and tensors in a linear regression setting. Our approach represents a hierarchical extension of the relevance determination framework, where we add a transformed Gaussian process to model the dependencies between the prior variances of regression weights. We combine this with a structured model of the prior variances of Fourier coefficients, which eliminates unnecessary high frequencies. The resulting prior encourages weights to be region-sparse in two different bases simultaneously. We develop Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to provide efficient inference for the posterior. Furthermore, a two-stage convex relaxation of the Laplace approximation approach is also provided to relax the inevitable non-convexity during the optimization. We finally show substantial improvements over comparable methods for both simulated and real datasets from brain imaging."}
{"text": "There is tremendous interest in precision medicine as a means to improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatment to individual characteristics. An individualized treatment rule formalizes precision medicine as a map from patient information to a recommended treatment. A treatment rule is defined to be optimal if it maximizes the mean of a scalar outcome in a population of interest, e.g., symptom reduction. However, clinical and intervention scientists often must balance multiple and possibly competing outcomes, e.g., symptom reduction and the risk of an adverse event. One approach to precision medicine in this setting is to elicit a composite outcome which balances all competing outcomes; unfortunately, eliciting a composite outcome directly from patients is difficult without a high-quality instrument, and an expert-derived composite outcome may not account for heterogeneity in patient preferences. We propose a new paradigm for the study of precision medicine using observational data that relies solely on the assumption that clinicians are approximately (i.e., imperfectly) making decisions to maximize individual patient utility. Estimated composite outcomes are subsequently used to construct an estimator of an individualized treatment rule which maximizes the mean of patient-specific composite outcomes. The estimated composite outcomes and estimated optimal individualized treatment rule provide new insights into patient preference heterogeneity, clinician behavior, and the value of precision medicine in a given domain. We derive inference procedures for the proposed estimators under mild conditions and demonstrate their finite sample performance through a suite of simulation experiments and an illustrative application to data from a study of bipolar depression."}

In its classical form, ICA relies on modeling the data as a linear mixture of non-Gaussian independent sources. The problem can be seen as a likelihood maximization problem. We introduce Picard-O, a preconditioned L-BFGS strategy over the set of orthogonal matrices, which can quickly separate both super- and sub-Gaussian signals. It returns the same set of sources as the widely used FastICA algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method is faster and more robust than FastICA on real data."}
{"text": "Stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) has been increasingly popular in Bayesian learning due to its ability to deal with large data. A standard SG-MCMC algorithm simulates samples from a discretized-time Markov chain to approximate a target distribution. However, the samples are typically highly correlated due to the sequential generation process, an undesired property in SG-MCMC. In contrary, Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) directly optimizes a set of particles, and it is able to approximate a target distribution with much fewer samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method to directly optimize particles (or samples) in SG-MCMC from scratch. Specifically, we propose efficient methods to solve the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation on the space of probability distributions, whose solution (i.e., a distribution) is approximated by particles. Through our framework, we are able to show connections of SG-MCMC to SVGD, as well as the seemly unrelated generative-adversarial-net framework. Under certain relaxations, particle optimization in SG-MCMC can be interpreted as an extension of standard SVGD with momentum."}

A new training scheme, *forking-sequences*, is designed for sequential nets to boost stability and performance. We show that the approach accommodates both temporal and static covariates, learning across multiple related series, shifting seasonality, future planned event spikes and cold-starts in real life large-scale forecasting. The performance of the framework is demonstrated in an application to predict the future demand of items sold on Amazon.com, and in a public probabilistic forecasting competition to predict electricity price and load."}
{"text": "We develop Riemannian Stein Variational Gradient Descent (RSVGD), a Bayesian inference method that generalizes Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to Riemann manifold. The benefits are two-folds: (i) for inference tasks in Euclidean spaces, RSVGD has the advantage over SVGD of utilizing information geometry, and (ii) for inference tasks on Riemann manifolds, RSVGD brings the unique advantages of SVGD to the Riemannian world. To appropriately transfer to Riemann manifolds, we conceive novel and non-trivial techniques for RSVGD, which are required by the intrinsically different characteristics of general Riemann manifolds from Euclidean spaces. We also discover Riemannian Stein's Identity and Riemannian Kernelized Stein Discrepancy. Experimental results show the advantages over SVGD of exploring distribution geometry and the advantages of particle-efficiency, iteration-effectiveness and approximation flexibility over other inference methods on Riemann manifolds."}
{"text": "The interpretation of deep learning models is a challenge due to their size, complexity, and often opaque internal state. In addition, many systems, such as image classifiers, operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which provide an interpretation of a neural net's internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result--for example, how sensitive a prediction of \"zebra\" is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application."}
{"text": "Missing data is an expected issue when large amounts of data is collected, and several imputation techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem. Beneath classical approaches such as MICE, the application of Machine Learning techniques is tempting. Here, the recently proposed missForest imputation method has shown high imputation accuracy under the Missing (Completely) at Random scheme with various missing rates. In its core, it is based on a random forest for classification and regression, respectively. In this paper we study whether this approach can even be enhanced by other methods such as the stochastic gradient tree boosting method, the C5.0 algorithm or modified random forest procedures. In particular, other resampling strategies within the random forest protocol are suggested. In an extensive simulation study, we analyze their performances for continuous, categorical as well as mixed-type data. Therein, MissBooPF, a combination of the stochastic gradient tree boosting method together with the parametrically bootstrapped random forest method, appeared to be promising. Finally, an empirical analysis focusing on credit information and Facebook data is conducted."}

It simulates the Nos\\'e-Hoover dynamics of a continuously-tempered Hamiltonian system built on the distribution of interest. A significant advantage of this method is that it is not only able to efficiently draw representative i.i.d. samples when the distribution contains multiple isolated modes, but capable of adaptively neutralising the noise arising from mini-batches and maintaining accurate sampling. While the properties of this method have been studied using synthetic distributions, experiments on three real datasets also demonstrated the gain of performance over several strong baselines with various types of neural networks plunged in."}
{"text": "In this paper, we study the effects of different prior and likelihood choices for Bayesian matrix factorisation, focusing on small datasets. These choices can greatly influence the predictive performance of the methods. We identify four groups of approaches: Gaussian-likelihood with real-valued priors, nonnegative priors, semi-nonnegative models, and finally Poisson-likelihood approaches. For each group we review several models from the literature, considering sixteen in total, and discuss the relations between different priors and matrix norms. We extensively compare these methods on eight real-world datasets across three application areas, giving both inter- and intra-group comparisons. We measure convergence runtime speed, cross-validation performance, sparse and noisy prediction performance, and model selection robustness. We offer several insights into the trade-offs between prior and likelihood choices for Bayesian matrix factorisation on small datasets - such as that Poisson models give poor predictions, and that nonnegative models are more constrained than real-valued ones."}
{"text": "In order to submit a claim to insurance companies, a doctor needs to code a patient encounter with both the diagnosis (ICDs) and procedures performed (CPTs) in an Electronic Health Record (EHR). Identifying and applying relevant procedures code is a cumbersome and time-consuming task as a doctor has to choose from around 13,000 procedure codes with no predefined one-to-one mapping. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art deep learning method for automatic and intelligent coding of procedures (CPTs) from the diagnosis codes (ICDs) entered by the doctor. Precisely, we cast the learning problem as a multi-label classification problem and use distributed representation to learn the input mapping of high-dimensional sparse ICDs codes. Our final model trained on 2.3 million claims is able to outperform existing rule-based probabilistic and association-rule mining based methods and has a recall of 90@3."}
{"text": "Identifying altered pathways that are associated with specific cancer types can potentially bring a significant impact on cancer patient treatment. Accurate identification of such key altered pathways information can be used to develop novel therapeutic agents as well as to understand the molecular mechanisms of various types of cancers better. Tri-matrix factorization is an efficient tool to learn associations between two different entities (e.g., cancer types and pathways in our case) from data. To successfully apply tri-matrix factorization methods to biomedical problems, biological prior knowledge such as pathway databases or protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, should be taken into account in the factorization model. However, it is not straightforward in the Bayesian setting even though Bayesian methods are more appealing than point estimate methods, such as a maximum likelihood or a maximum posterior method, in the sense that they calculate distributions over variables and are robust against overfitting. We propose a Bayesian (semi-)nonnegative matrix factorization model for human cancer genomic data, where the biological prior knowledge represented by a pathway database and a PPI network is taken into account in the factorization model through a finite dependent Beta-Bernoulli prior. We tested our method on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and found that the pathways identified by our method can be used as a prognostic biomarkers for patient subgroup identification."}
{"text": "We introduce a new approach for topic modeling that is supervised by survival analysis. Specifically, we build on recent work on unsupervised topic modeling with so-called anchor words by providing supervision through an elastic-net regularized Cox proportional hazards model. In short, an anchor word being present in a document provides strong indication that the document is partially about a specific topic. For example, by seeing \"gallstones\" in a document, we are fairly certain that the document is partially about medicine. Our proposed method alternates between learning a topic model and learning a survival model to find a local minimum of a block convex optimization problem. We apply our proposed approach to predicting how long patients with pancreatitis admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) will stay in the ICU. Our approach is as accurate as the best of a variety of baselines while being more interpretable than any of the baselines."}

{"text": "A variety of machine learning tasks---e.g., matrix factorization, topic modelling, and feature allocation---can be viewed as learning the parameters of a probability distribution over bipartite graphs. Recently, a new class of models for networks, the sparse exchangeable graphs, have been introduced to resolve some important pathologies of traditional approaches to statistical network modelling; most notably, the inability to model sparsity (in the asymptotic sense). The present paper explains some practical insights arising from this work. We first show how to check if sparsity is relevant for modelling a given (fixed size) dataset by using network subsampling to identify a simple signature of sparsity. We discuss the implications of the (sparse) exchangeable subsampling theory for test-train dataset splitting; we argue common approaches can lead to biased results, and we propose a principled alternative. Finally, we study sparse exchangeable Poisson matrix factorization as a worked example. In particular, we show how to adapt mean field variational inference to the sparse exchangeable setting, allowing us to scale inference to huge datasets."}
{"text": "The problems of outliers detection and robust regression in a high-dimensional setting are fundamental in statistics, and have numerous applications. Following a recent set of works providing methods for simultaneous robust regression and outliers detection, we consider in this paper a model of linear regression with individual intercepts, in a high-dimensional setting. We introduce a new procedure for simultaneous estimation of the linear regression coefficients and intercepts, using two dedicated sorted-$\\ell_1$ penalizations, also called SLOPE. We develop a complete theory for this problem: first, we provide sharp upper bounds on the statistical estimation error of both the vector of individual intercepts and regression coefficients. Second, we give an asymptotic control on the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and statistical power for support selection of the individual intercepts. As a consequence, this paper is the first to introduce a procedure with guaranteed FDR and statistical power control for outliers detection under the mean-shift model. Numerical illustrations, with a comparison to recent alternative approaches, are provided on both simulated and several real-world datasets. Experiments are conducted using an open-source software written in Python and C++."}
{"text": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a model-based approach for gradient-free black-box function optimization. Typically, BO is powered by a Gaussian process (GP), whose algorithmic complexity is cubic in the number of evaluations. Hence, GP-based BO cannot leverage large amounts of past or related function evaluations, for example, to warm start the BO procedure. We develop a multiple adaptive Bayesian linear regression model as a scalable alternative whose complexity is linear in the number of observations. The multiple Bayesian linear regression models are coupled through a shared feedforward neural network, which learns a joint representation and transfers knowledge across machine learning problems."}
{"text": "In this paper, we study the general problem of optimizing a convex function $F(L)$ over the set of $p \\times p$ matrices, subject to rank constraints on $L$. However, existing first-order methods for solving such problems either are too slow to converge, or require multiple invocations of singular value decompositions. On the other hand, factorization-based non-convex algorithms, while being much faster, require stringent assumptions on the \\emph{condition number} of the optimum. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithmic framework that achieves the best of both worlds: asymptotically as fast as factorization methods, while requiring no dependency on the condition number.   We instantiate our general framework for three important matrix estimation problems that impact several practical applications; (i) a \\emph{nonlinear} variant of affine rank minimization, (ii) logistic PCA, and (iii) precision matrix estimation in probabilistic graphical model learning. We then derive explicit bounds on the sample complexity as well as the running time of our approach, and show that it achieves the best possible bounds for both cases. We also provide an extensive range of experimental results, and demonstrate that our algorithm provides a very attractive tradeoff between estimation accuracy and running time."}

{"text": "We study the problem of recovering a structured signal $\\mathbf{x}_0$ from high-dimensional data $\\mathbf{y}_i=f(\\mathbf{a}_i^T\\mathbf{x}_0)$ for some nonlinear (and potentially unknown) link function $f$, when the regressors $\\mathbf{a}_i$ are iid Gaussian. Brillinger (1982) showed that ordinary least-squares estimates $\\mathbf{x}_0$ up to a constant of proportionality $\\mu_\\ell$, which depends on $f$. Recently, Plan & Vershynin (2015) extended this result to the high-dimensional setting deriving sharp error bounds for the generalized Lasso. Unfortunately, both least-squares and the Lasso fail to recover $\\mathbf{x}_0$ when $\\mu_\\ell=0$. For example, this includes all even link functions. We resolve this issue by proposing and analyzing an alternative convex recovery method. In a nutshell, our method treats such link functions as if they were linear in a lifted space of higher-dimension. Interestingly, our error analysis captures the effect of both the nonlinearity and the problem's geometry in a few simple summary parameters."}
{"text": "Subset selection for multiple linear regression aims to construct a regression model that minimizes errors by selecting a small number of explanatory variables. Once a model is built, various statistical tests and diagnostics are conducted to validate the model and to determine whether the regression assumptions are met. Most traditional approaches require human decisions at this step. For example, the user adding or removing a variable until a satisfactory model is obtained. However, this trial-and-error strategy cannot guarantee that a subset that minimizes the errors while satisfying all regression assumptions will be found. In this paper, we propose a fully automated model building procedure for multiple linear regression subset selection that integrates model building and validation based on mathematical programming. The proposed model minimizes mean squared errors while ensuring that the majority of the important regression assumptions are met. We also propose an efficient constraint to approximate the constraint for the coefficient t-test. When no subset satisfies all of the considered regression assumptions, our model provides an alternative subset that satisfies most of these assumptions. Computational results show that our model yields better solutions (i.e., satisfying more regression assumptions) compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark models while maintaining similar explanatory power."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of clustering with the longest-leg path distance (LLPD) metric, which is informative for elongated and irregularly shaped clusters. We prove finite-sample guarantees on the performance of clustering with respect to this metric when random samples are drawn from multiple intrinsically low-dimensional clusters in high-dimensional space, in the presence of a large number of high-dimensional outliers. By combining these results with spectral clustering with respect to LLPD, we provide conditions under which the Laplacian eigengap statistic correctly determines the number of clusters for a large class of data sets, and prove guarantees on the labeling accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Our methods are quite general and provide performance guarantees for spectral clustering with any ultrametric. We also introduce an efficient, easy to implement approximation algorithm for the LLPD based on a multiscale analysis of adjacency graphs, which allows for the runtime of LLPD spectral clustering to be quasilinear in the number of data points."}
{"text": "We investigate the optimization of two probabilistic generative models with binary latent variables using a novel variational EM approach. The approach distinguishes itself from previous variational approaches by using latent states as variational parameters. Here we use efficient and general purpose sampling procedures to vary the latent states, and investigate the \"black box\" applicability of the resulting optimization procedure. For general purpose applicability, samples are drawn from approximate marginal distributions of the considered generative model as well as from the model's prior distribution. As such, variational sampling is defined in a generic form, and is directly executable for a given model. As a proof of concept, we then apply the novel procedure (A) to Binary Sparse Coding (a model with continuous observables), and (B) to basic Sigmoid Belief Networks (which are models with binary observables). Numerical experiments verify that the investigated approach efficiently as well as effectively increases a variational free energy objective without requiring any additional analytical steps."}
{"text": "Classification in the dissimilarity space has become a very active research area since it provides a possibility to learn from data given in the form of pairwise non-metric dissimilarities, which otherwise would be difficult to cope with. The selection of prototypes is a key step for the further creation of the space. However, despite previous efforts to find good prototypes, how to select the best representation set remains an open issue. In this paper we proposed scalable methods to select the set of prototypes out of very large datasets. The methods are based on genetic algorithms, dissimilarity-based hashing, and two different unsupervised and supervised scalable criteria. The unsupervised criterion is based on the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph created by the prototypes as nodes and the dissimilarities as edges. The supervised criterion is based on counting matching labels of objects and their closest prototypes. The suitability of these type of algorithms is analyzed for the specific case of dissimilarity representations. The experimental results showed that the methods select good prototypes taking advantage of the large datasets, and they do so at low runtimes."}
{"text": "Point forecasting of univariate time series is a challenging problem with extensive work having been conducted. However, nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of time series, such as in the form of quantiles or prediction intervals is an even more challenging problem. In an effort to expand the possible forecasting paradigms we devise and explore an extrapolation-based approach that has not been applied before for probabilistic forecasting. We present a novel quantile Fourier neural network is for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of univariate time series. Multi-step predictions are provided in the form of composite quantiles using time as the only input to the model. This effectively is a form of extrapolation based nonlinear quantile regression applied for forecasting. Experiments are conducted on eight real world datasets that demonstrate a variety of periodic and aperiodic patterns. Nine naive and advanced methods are used as benchmarks including quantile regression neural network, support vector quantile regression, SARIMA, and exponential smoothing. The obtained empirical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing high quality and accurate probabilistic predictions."}
{"text": "This paper provides estimation and inference methods for a large number of heterogeneous treatment effects in a panel data setting with many potential controls. We assume that heterogeneous treatment is the result of a low-dimensional base treatment interacting with many heterogeneity-relevant controls, but only a small number of these interactions have a non-zero heterogeneous effect relative to the average. The method has two stages. First, we use modern machine learning techniques to estimate the expectation functions of the outcome and base treatment given controls and take the residuals of each variable. Second, we estimate the treatment effect by l1-regularized regression (i.e., Lasso) of the outcome residuals on the base treatment residuals interacted with the controls. We debias this estimator to conduct pointwise inference about a single coefficient of treatment effect vector and simultaneous inference about the whole vector. To account for the unobserved unit effects inherent in panel data, we use an extension of correlated random effects approach of Mundlak (1978) and Chamberlain (1982) to a high-dimensional setting. As an empirical application, we estimate a large number of heterogeneous demand elasticities based on a novel dataset from a major European food distributor."}
{"text": "Computing the partition function $Z$ of a discrete graphical model is a fundamental inference challenge. Since this is computationally intractable, variational approximations are often used in practice. Recently, so-called gauge transformations were used to improve variational lower bounds on $Z$. In this paper, we propose a new gauge-variational approach, termed WMBE-G, which combines gauge transformations with the weighted mini-bucket elimination (WMBE) method. WMBE-G can provide both upper and lower bounds on $Z$, and is easier to optimize than the prior gauge-variational algorithm. We show that WMBE-G strictly improves the earlier WMBE approximation for symmetric models including Ising models with no magnetic field. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WMBE-G even for generic, nonsymmetric models."}
{"text": "Basis adaptation in Homogeneous Chaos spaces rely on a suitable rotation of the underlying Gaussian germ. Several rotations have been proposed in the literature resulting in adaptations with different convergence properties. In this paper we present a new adaptation mechanism that builds on compressive sensing algorithms, resulting in a reduced polynomial chaos approximation with optimal sparsity. The developed adaptation algorithm consists of a two-step optimization procedure that computes the optimal coefficients and the input projection matrix of a low dimensional chaos expansion with respect to an optimally rotated basis. We demonstrate the attractive features of our algorithm through several numerical examples including the application on Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations of turbulent combustion in a HIFiRE scramjet engine."}
{"text": "Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP) are hierarchical generalizations of Gaussian Processes (GP) that have proven to work effectively on a multiple supervised regression tasks. They combine the well calibrated uncertainty estimates of GPs with the great flexibility of multilayer models. In DGPs, given the inputs, the outputs of the layers are Gaussian distributions parameterized by their means and covariances. These layers are realized as Sparse GPs where the training data is approximated using a small set of pseudo points. In this work, we show that the computational cost of DGPs can be reduced with no loss in performance by using a separate, smaller set of pseudo points when calculating the layerwise variance while using a larger set of pseudo points when calculating the layerwise mean. This enabled us to train larger models that have lower cost and better predictive performance."}
{"text": "This paper deals with inference and prediction for multiple correlated time series, where one has also the choice of using a candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each target series. Starting with a structural model for the time-series, Bayesian tools are used for model fitting, prediction, and feature selection, thus extending some recent work along these lines for the univariate case. The Bayesian paradigm in this multivariate setting helps the model avoid overfitting as well as capture correlations among the multiple time series with the various state components. The model provides needed flexibility to choose a different set of components and available predictors for each target series. The cyclical component in the model can handle large variations in the short term, which may be caused by external shocks. We run extensive simulations to investigate properties such as estimation accuracy and performance in forecasting. We then run an empirical study with one-step-ahead prediction on the max log return of a portfolio of stocks that involve four leading financial institutions. Both the simulation studies and the extensive empirical study confirm that this multivariate model outperforms three other benchmark models, viz. a model that treats each target series as independent, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with regression (ARIMAX), and the multivariate ARIMAX (MARIMAX) model."}
{"text": "We formulate a supervised learning problem, referred to as continuous ranking, where a continuous real-valued label Y is assigned to an observable r.v. X taking its values in a feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ and the goal is to order all possible observations x in $\\mathcal{X}$ by means of a scoring function $s:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ so that s(X) and Y tend to increase or decrease together with highest probability. This problem generalizes bi/multi-partite ranking to a certain extent and the task of finding optimal scoring functions s(x) can be naturally cast as optimization of a dedicated functional criterion, called the IROC curve here, or as maximization of the Kendall ${\\tau}$ related to the pair (s(X), Y ). From the theoretical side, we describe the optimal elements of this problem and provide statistical guarantees for empirical Kendall ${\\tau}$ maximization under appropriate conditions for the class of scoring function candidates. We also propose a recursive statistical learning algorithm tailored to empirical IROC curve optimization and producing a piecewise constant scoring function that is fully described by an oriented binary tree. Preliminary numerical experiments highlight the difference in nature between regression and continuous ranking and provide strong empirical evidence of the performance of empirical optimizers of the criteria proposed."}
{"text": "Gaussian process priors are commonly used in aerospace design for performing Bayesian optimization. Nonetheless, Gaussian processes suffer two significant drawbacks: outliers are a priori assumed unlikely, and the posterior variance conditioned on observed data depends only on the locations of those data, not the associated sample values. Student's-T processes are a generalization of Gaussian processes, founded on the Student's-T distribution instead of the Gaussian distribution. Student's-T processes maintain the primary advantages of Gaussian processes (kernel function, analytic update rule) with additional benefits beyond Gaussian processes. The Student's-T distribution has higher Kurtosis than a Gaussian distribution and so outliers are much more likely, and the posterior variance increases or decreases depending on the variance of observed data sample values. Here, we describe Student's-T processes, and discuss their advantages in the context of aerospace optimization. We show how to construct a Student's-T process using a kernel function and how to update the process given new samples. We provide a clear derivation of optimization-relevant quantities such as expected improvement, and contrast with the related computations for Gaussian processes. Finally, we compare the performance of Student's-T processes against Gaussian process on canonical test problems in Bayesian optimization, and apply the Student's-T process to the optimization of an aerostructural design problem."}
{"text": "Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in predictive model building, because of the small number of samples $(n)$ compared to the huge amount of features $(p)$. This \"$n<<p$\" property has hampered application of deep learning techniques for disease outcome classification. Sparse learning by incorporating external gene network information could be a potential solution to this issue. Still, the problem is very challenging because (1) there are tens of thousands of features and only hundreds of training samples, (2) the scale-free structure of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of convolutional neural networks. To address these issues and build a robust classification model, we propose the Graph-Embedded Deep Feedforward Networks (GEDFN), to integrate external relational information of features into the deep neural network architecture. The method is able to achieve sparse connection between network layers to prevent overfitting. To validate the method's capability, we conducted both simulation experiments and a real data analysis using a breast cancer RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The resulting high classification accuracy and easily interpretable feature selection results suggest the method is a useful addition to the current classification models and feature selection procedures. The method is available at https://github.com/yunchuankong/NetworkNeuralNetwork."}
{"text": "The motivations for using variational inference (VI) in neural networks differ significantly from those in latent variable models. This has a counter-intuitive consequence; more expressive variational approximations can provide significantly worse predictions as compared to those with less expressive families. In this work we make two contributions. First, we identify a cause of this performance gap, variational over-pruning. Second, we introduce a theoretically grounded explanation for this phenomenon. Our perspective sheds light on several related published results and provides intuition into the design of effective variational approximations of neural networks."}
{"text": "In this paper, we design a nonparametric online algorithm for estimating the triggering functions of multivariate Hawkes processes. Unlike parametric estimation, where evolutionary dynamics can be exploited for fast computation of the gradient, and unlike typical function learning, where representer theorem is readily applicable upon proper regularization of the objective function, nonparametric estimation faces the challenges of (i) inefficient evaluation of the gradient, (ii) lack of representer theorem, and (iii) computationally expensive projection necessary to guarantee positivity of the triggering functions. In this paper, we offer solutions to the above challenges, and design an online estimation algorithm named NPOLE-MHP that outputs estimations with a $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ regret, and a $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ stability. Furthermore, we design an algorithm, NPOLE-MMHP, for estimation of multivariate marked Hawkes processes. We test the performance of NPOLE-MHP on various synthetic and real datasets, and demonstrate, under different evaluation metrics, that NPOLE-MHP performs as good as the optimal maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), while having a run time as little as parametric online algorithms."}
{"text": "Decision trees algorithms use a gain function to select the best split during the tree's induction. This function is crucial to obtain trees with high predictive accuracy. Some gain functions can suffer from a bias when it compares splits of different arities. Quinlan proposed a gain ratio in C4.5's information gain function to fix this bias. In this paper, we present an updated version of the gain ratio that performs better as it tries to fix the gain ratio's bias for unbalanced trees and some splits with low predictive interest."}
{"text": "The need to reason about uncertainty in large, complex, and multi-modal datasets has become increasingly common across modern scientific environments. The ability to transform samples from one distribution $P$ to another distribution $Q$ enables the solution to many problems in machine learning (e.g. Bayesian inference, generative modeling) and has been actively pursued from theoretical, computational, and application perspectives across the fields of information theory, computer science, and biology. Performing such transformations, in general, still leads to computational difficulties, especially in high dimensions. Here, we consider the problem of computing such \"measure transport maps\" with efficient and parallelizable methods. Under the mild assumptions that $P$ need not be known but can be sampled from, and that the density of $Q$ is known up to a proportionality constant, and that $Q$ is log-concave, we provide in this work a convex optimization problem pertaining to relative entropy minimization. We show how an empirical minimization formulation and polynomial chaos map parameterization can allow for learning a transport map between $P$ and $Q$ with distributed and scalable methods. We also leverage findings from nonequilibrium thermodynamics to represent the transport map as a composition of simpler maps, each of which is learned sequentially with a transport cost regularized version of the aforementioned problem formulation. We provide examples of our framework within the context of Bayesian inference for the Boston housing dataset and generative modeling for handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset."}
{"text": "Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used BSS method that can uniquely achieve source recovery, subject to only scaling and permutation ambiguities, through the assumption of statistical independence on the part of the latent sources. Independent vector analysis (IVA) extends the applicability of ICA by jointly decomposing multiple datasets through the exploitation of the dependencies across datasets. Though both ICA and IVA algorithms cast in the maximum likelihood (ML) framework enable the use of all available statistical information in reality, they often deviate from their theoretical optimality properties due to improper estimation of the probability density function (PDF). This motivates the development of flexible ICA and IVA algorithms that closely adhere to the underlying statistical description of the data. Although it is attractive minimize the assumptions, important prior information about the data, such as sparsity, is usually available. If incorporated into the ICA model, use of this additional information can relax the independence assumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance. Therefore, the development of a unified mathematical framework that can take into account both statistical independence and sparsity is of great interest. In this work, we first introduce a flexible ICA algorithm that uses an effective PDF estimator to accurately capture the underlying statistical properties of the data. We then discuss several techniques to accurately estimate the parameters of the multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution, and how to integrate them into the IVA model. Finally, we provide a mathematical framework that enables direct control over the influence of statistical independence and sparsity, and use this framework to develop an effective ICA algorithm that can jointly exploit these two forms of diversity."}

{"text": "A common method of generalizing binary to multi-class classification is the error correcting code (ECC). ECCs may be optimized in a number of ways, for instance by making them orthogonal. Here we test two types of orthogonal ECCs on seven different datasets using three types of binary classifier and compare them with three other multi-class methods: 1 vs. 1, one-versus-the-rest and random ECCs. The first type of orthogonal ECC, in which the codes contain no zeros, admits a fast and simple method of solving for the probabilities. Orthogonal ECCs are always more accurate than random ECCs as predicted by recent literature. Improvments in uncertainty coefficient (U.C.) range between 0.4--17.5% (0.004--0.139, absolute), while improvements in Brier score between 0.7--10.7%. Unfortunately, orthogonal ECCs are rarely more accurate than 1 vs. 1. Disparities are worst when the methods are paired with logistic regression, with orthogonal ECCs never beating 1 vs. 1. When the methods are paired with SVM, the losses are less significant, peaking at 1.5%, relative, 0.011 absolute in uncertainty coefficient and 6.5% in Brier scores. Orthogonal ECCs are always the fastest of the five multi-class methods when paired with linear classifiers. When paired with a piecewise linear classifier, whose classification speed does not depend on the number of training samples, classifications using orthogonal ECCs were always more accurate than the the remaining three methods and also faster than 1 vs. 1. Losses against 1 vs. 1 here were higher, peaking at 1.9% (0.017, absolute), in U.C. and 39% in Brier score. Gains in speed ranged between 1.1% and over 100%. Whether the speed increase is worth the penalty in accuracy will depend on the application."}
{"text": "Any gradient descent optimization requires to choose a learning rate. With deeper and deeper models, tuning that learning rate can easily become tedious and does not necessarily lead to an ideal convergence. We propose a variation of the gradient descent algorithm in the which the learning rate is not fixed. Instead, we learn the learning rate itself, either by another gradient descent (first-order method), or by Newton's method (second-order). This way, gradient descent for any machine learning algorithm can be optimized."}

{"text": "Modern vehicles are equipped with increasingly complex sensors. These sensors generate large volumes of data that provide opportunities for modeling and analysis. Here, we are interested in exploiting this data to learn aspects of behaviors and the road network associated with individual drivers. Our dataset is collected on a standard vehicle used to commute to work and for personal trips. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on the GPS position and orientation data is utilized to compress the large amount of position information into a small amount of road segment states. Each state has a set of observations, i.e. car signals, associated with it that are quantized and modeled as draws from a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). The inference for the topic distributions is carried out using HDP split-merge sampling algorithm. The topic distributions over joint quantized car signals characterize the driving situation in the respective road state. In a novel manner, we demonstrate how the sparsity of the personal road network of a driver in conjunction with a hierarchical topic model allows data driven predictions about destinations as well as likely road conditions."}

{"text": "The vanishing ideal is a set of polynomials that takes zero value on the given data points. Originally proposed in computer algebra, the vanishing ideal has been recently exploited for extracting the nonlinear structures of data in many applications. To avoid overfitting to noisy data, the polynomials are often designed to approximately rather than exactly equal zero on the designated data. Although such approximations empirically demonstrate high performance, the sound algebraic structure of the vanishing ideal is lost. The present paper proposes a vanishing ideal that is tolerant to noisy data and also pursued to have a better algebraic structure. As a new problem, we simultaneously find a set of polynomials and data points for which the polynomials approximately vanish on the input data points, and almost exactly vanish on the discovered data points. In experimental classification tests, our method discovered much fewer and lower-degree polynomials than an existing state-of-the-art method. Consequently, our method accelerated the runtime of the classification tasks without degrading the classification accuracy."}
{"text": "Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is widely used for evaluating diagnostic systems. Recent studies have shown that estimating an area under ROC curve (AUC) with standard cross-validation methods suffers from a large bias. The leave-pair-out (LPO) cross-validation has been shown to correct this bias. However, while LPO produces an almost unbiased estimate of AUC, it does not provide a ranking of the data needed for plotting and analyzing the ROC curve. In this study, we propose a new method called tournament leave-pair-out (TLPO) cross-validation. This method extends LPO by creating a tournament from pair comparisons to produce a ranking for the data. TLPO preserves the advantage of LPO for estimating AUC, while it also allows performing ROC analysis. We have shown using both synthetic and real world data that TLPO is as reliable as LPO for AUC estimation and confirmed the bias in leave-one-out cross-validation on low-dimensional data."}
{"text": "In the stochastic bandit problem, the goal is to maximize an unknown function via a sequence of noisy evaluations. Typically, the observation noise is assumed to be independent of the evaluation point and to satisfy a tail bound uniformly on the domain; a restrictive assumption for many applications. In this work, we consider bandits with heteroscedastic noise, where we explicitly allow the noise distribution to depend on the evaluation point. We show that this leads to new trade-offs for information and regret, which are not taken into account by existing approaches like upper confidence bound algorithms (UCB) or Thompson Sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a frequentist regret analysis framework, that is similar to the Bayesian framework of Russo and Van Roy (2014), and we prove a new high-probability regret bound for general, possibly randomized policies, which depends on a quantity we refer to as regret-information ratio. From this bound, we define a frequentist version of Information Directed Sampling (IDS) to minimize the regret-information ratio over all possible action sampling distributions. This further relies on concentration inequalities for online least squares regression in separable Hilbert spaces, which we generalize to the case of heteroscedastic noise. We then formulate several variants of IDS for linear and reproducing kernel Hilbert space response functions, yielding novel algorithms for Bayesian optimization. We also prove frequentist regret bounds, which in the homoscedastic case recover known bounds for UCB, but can be much better when the noise is heteroscedastic. Empirically, we demonstrate in a linear setting with heteroscedastic noise, that some of our methods can outperform UCB and Thompson Sampling, while staying competitive when the noise is homoscedastic."}

In this work, we attempt to systematically characterize methods for density estimation. Broadly speaking, most of the existing methods can be categorized into either using: \\textit{a}) autoregressive models to estimate the conditional factors of the chain rule, $p(x_{i}\\, |\\, x_{i-1}, \\ldots)$; or \\textit{b}) non-linear transformations of variables of a simple base distribution. Based on the study of the characteristics of these categories, we propose multiple novel methods for each category. For example we proposed RNN based transformations to model non-Markovian dependencies. Further, through a comprehensive study over both real world and synthetic data, we show for that jointly leveraging transformations of variables and autoregressive conditional models, results in a considerable improvement in performance. We illustrate the use of our models in outlier detection and image modeling. Finally we introduce a novel data driven framework for learning a family of distributions."}
{"text": "State-space models (SSMs) are a highly expressive model class for learning patterns in time series data and for system identification. Deterministic versions of SSMs (e.g. LSTMs) proved extremely successful in modeling complex time series data. Fully probabilistic SSMs, however, are often found hard to train, even for smaller problems. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel model formulation and a scalable training algorithm based on doubly stochastic variational inference and Gaussian processes. In contrast to existing work, the proposed variational approximation allows one to fully capture the latent state temporal correlations. These correlations are the key to robust training. The effectiveness of the proposed PR-SSM is evaluated on a set of real-world benchmark datasets in comparison to state-of-the-art probabilistic model learning methods. Scalability and robustness are demonstrated on a high dimensional problem."}
{"text": "Causal inference using observational data is challenging, especially in the bivariate case. Through the minimum description length principle, we link the postulate of independence between the generating mechanisms of the cause and of the effect given the cause to quantile regression. Based on this theory, we develop Bivariate Quantile Causal Discovery (bQCD), a new method to distinguish cause from effect assuming no confounding, selection bias or feedback. Because it uses multiple quantile levels instead of the conditional mean only, bQCD is adaptive not only to additive, but also to multiplicative or even location-scale generating mechanisms. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform an extensive empirical comparison on both synthetic and real datasets. This study shows that bQCD is robust across different implementations of the method (i.e., the quantile regression), computationally efficient, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Gaussian process (GP) models provide a powerful tool for prediction but are computationally prohibitive using large data sets. In such scenarios, one has to resort to approximate methods. We derive an approximation based on a composite likelihood approach using a general belief updating framework, which leads to a recursive computation of the predictor as well as of learning the hyper-parameters. We then provide an analysis of the derived composite GP model in predictive and information-theoretic terms. Finally, we evaluate the approximation with both synthetic data and a real-world application."}
{"text": "We study a logistic model-based active learning procedure for binary classification problems, in which we adopt a batch subject selection strategy with a modified sequential experimental design method. Moreover, accompanying the proposed subject selection scheme, we simultaneously conduct a greedy variable selection procedure such that we can update the classification model with all labeled training subjects. The proposed algorithm repeatedly performs both subject and variable selection steps until a prefixed stopping criterion is reached. Our numerical results show that the proposed procedure has competitive performance, with smaller training size and a more compact model, comparing with that of the classifier trained with all variables and a full data set. We also apply the proposed procedure to a well-known wave data set (Breiman et al., 1984) to confirm the performance of our method."}
{"text": "Topic models are Bayesian models that are frequently used to capture the latent structure of certain corpora of documents or images. Each data element in such a corpus (for instance each item in a collection of scientific articles) is regarded as a convex combination of a small number of vectors corresponding to `topics' or `components'. The weights are assumed to have a Dirichlet prior distribution. The standard approach towards approximating the posterior is to use variational inference algorithms, and in particular a mean field approximation.   We show that this approach suffers from an instability that can produce misleading conclusions. Namely, for certain regimes of the model parameters, variational inference outputs a non-trivial decomposition into topics. However --for the same parameter values-- the data contain no actual information about the true decomposition, and hence the output of the algorithm is uncorrelated with the true topic decomposition. Among other consequences, the estimated posterior mean is significantly wrong, and estimated Bayesian credible regions do not achieve the nominal coverage. We discuss how this instability is remedied by more accurate mean field approximations."}
{"text": "Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Computer systems can assist in melanoma detection, but are not widespread in clinical practice. In 2016, an open challenge in classification of dermoscopic images of skin lesions was announced. A training set of 900 images with corresponding class labels and semi-automatic/manual segmentation masks was released for the challenge. An independent test set of 379 images was used to rank the participants. This article demonstrates the impact of ranking criteria, segmentation method and classifier, and highlights the clinical perspective. We compare five different measures for diagnostic accuracy by analysing the resulting ranking of the computer systems in the challenge. Choice of performance measure had great impact on the ranking. Systems that were ranked among the top three for one measure, dropped to the bottom half when changing performance measure. Nevus Doctor, a computer system previously developed by the authors, was used to investigate the impact of segmentation and classifier. The unexpected small impact of automatic versus semi-automatic/manual segmentation suggests that improvements of the automatic segmentation method w.r.t. resemblance to semi-automatic/manual segmentation will not improve diagnostic accuracy substantially. A small set of similar classification algorithms are used to investigate the impact of classifier on the diagnostic accuracy. The variability in diagnostic accuracy for different classifier algorithms was larger than the variability for segmentation methods, and suggests a focus for future investigations. From a clinical perspective, the misclassification of a melanoma as benign has far greater cost than the misclassification of a benign lesion. For computer systems to have clinical impact, their performance should be ranked by a high-sensitivity measure."}
{"text": "In this paper, the task-related fMRI problem is treated in its matrix factorization formulation, focused on the Dictionary Learning (DL) approach. The new method allows the incorporation of a priori knowledge associated both with the experimental design as well as with available brain Atlases. Moreover, the proposed method can efficiently cope with uncertainties related to the HRF modeling. In addition, the proposed method bypasses one of the major drawbacks that are associated with DL methods; that is, the selection of the sparsity-related regularization parameters. In our formulation, an alternative sparsity promoting constraint is employed, that bears a direct relation to the number of voxels in the spatial maps. Hence, the related parameters can be tuned using information that is available from brain atlases. The proposed method is evaluated against several other popular techniques, including GLM. The obtained performance gains are reported via a novel realistic synthetic fMRI dataset as well as real data that are related to a challenging experimental design."}
{"text": "Correlated component analysis as proposed by Dmochowski et al. (2012) is a tool for investigating brain process similarity in the responses to multiple views of a given stimulus. Correlated components are identified under the assumption that the involved spatial networks are identical. Here we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that can infer the level of universality in such multi-view data, from completely unrelated representations, corresponding to canonical correlation analysis, to identical representations as in correlated component analysis. This new model, which we denote Bayesian correlated component analysis, evaluates favourably against three relevant algorithms in simulated data. A well-established benchmark EEG dataset is used to further validate the new model and infer the variability of spatial representations across multiple subjects."}
{"text": "There are a multitude of methods to perform multi-set correlated component analysis (MCCA), including some that require iterative solutions. The methods differ on the criterion they optimize and the constraints placed on the solutions. This note focuses perhaps on the simplest version, which can be solved in a single step as the eigenvectors of matrix ${\\bf D}^{-1} {\\bf R}$. Here ${\\bf R}$ is the covariance matrix of the concatenated data, and ${\\bf D}$ is its block-diagonal. This note shows that this solution maximizes inter-set correlation (ISC) without further constraints. It also relates the solution to a two step procedure, which first whitens each dataset using PCA, and then performs an additional PCA on the concatenated and whitened data. Both these solutions are known, although a clear derivation and simple implementation are hard to find. This short note aims to remedy this."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of model selection in Gaussian Markov fields in the sample deficient scenario. The benchmark information-theoretic results in the case of d-regular graphs require the number of samples to be at least proportional to the logarithm of the number of vertices to allow consistent graph recovery. When the number of samples is less than this amount, reliable detection of all edges is impossible. In many applications, it is more important to learn the distribution of the edge (coupling) parameters over the network than the specific locations of the edges. Assuming that the entire graph can be partitioned into a number of spatial regions with similar edge parameters and reasonably regular boundaries, we develop new information-theoretic sample complexity bounds and show that a bounded number of samples can be sufficient to consistently recover these regions. Finally, we introduce and analyze an efficient region growing algorithm capable of recovering the regions with high accuracy. We show that it is consistent and demonstrate its performance benefits in synthetic simulations."}
{"text": "Learning using privileged information is an attractive problem setting that helps many learning scenarios in the real world. A state-of-the-art method of Gaussian process classification (GPC) with privileged information is GPC+, which incorporates privileged information into a noise term of the likelihood. A drawback of GPC+ is that it requires numerical quadrature to calculate the posterior distribution of the latent function, which is extremely time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel classification method with privileged information based on Gaussian processes, called \"soft-label-transferred Gaussian process (SLT-GP).\" Our basic idea is that we construct another learning task of predicting soft labels (continuous values) obtained from privileged information and we perform transfer learning from this task to the target task of predicting hard labels. We derive a PAC-Bayesian bound of our proposed method, which justifies optimizing hyperparameters by the empirical Bayes method. We also experimentally show the usefulness of our proposed method compared with GPC and GPC+."}
{"text": "We study safe screening for metric learning. Distance metric learning can optimize a metric over a set of triplets, each one of which is defined by a pair of same class instances and an instance in a different class. However, the number of possible triplets is quite huge even for a small dataset. Our safe triplet screening identifies triplets which can be safely removed from the optimization problem without losing the optimality. Compared with existing safe screening studies, triplet screening is particularly significant because of (1) the huge number of possible triplets, and (2) the semi-definite constraint in the optimization. We derive several variants of screening rules, and analyze their relationships. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of safe triplet screening."}
{"text": "We theoretically discuss why deep neural networks (DNNs) performs better than other models in some cases by investigating statistical properties of DNNs for non-smooth functions. While DNNs have empirically shown higher performance than other standard methods, understanding its mechanism is still a challenging problem. From an aspect of the statistical theory, it is known many standard methods attain the optimal rate of generalization errors for smooth functions in large sample asymptotics, and thus it has not been straightforward to find theoretical advantages of DNNs. This paper fills this gap by considering learning of a certain class of non-smooth functions, which was not covered by the previous theory. We derive the generalization error of estimators by DNNs with a ReLU activation, and show that convergence rates of the generalization by DNNs are almost optimal to estimate the non-smooth functions, while some of the popular models do not attain the optimal rate. In addition, our theoretical result provides guidelines for selecting an appropriate number of layers and edges of DNNs. We provide numerical experiments to support the theoretical results."}
{"text": "A simple framework Probabilistic Multi-view Graph Embedding (PMvGE) is proposed for multi-view feature learning with many-to-many associations so that it generalizes various existing multi-view methods. PMvGE is a probabilistic model for predicting new associations via graph embedding of the nodes of data vectors with links of their associations. Multi-view data vectors with many-to-many associations are transformed by neural networks to feature vectors in a shared space, and the probability of new association between two data vectors is modeled by the inner product of their feature vectors. While existing multi-view feature learning techniques can treat only either of many-to-many association or non-linear transformation, PMvGE can treat both simultaneously. By combining Mercer's theorem and the universal approximation theorem, we prove that PMvGE learns a wide class of similarity measures across views. Our likelihood-based estimator enables efficient computation of non-linear transformations of data vectors in large-scale datasets by minibatch SGD, and numerical experiments illustrate that PMvGE outperforms existing multi-view methods."}
{"text": "We consider multi-task learning, which simultaneously learns related prediction tasks, to improve generalization performance. We factorize a coefficient matrix as the product of two matrices based on a low-rank assumption. These matrices have sparsities to simultaneously perform variable selection and learn and overlapping group structure among the tasks. The resulting bi-convex objective function is minimized by alternating optimization where sub-problems are solved using alternating direction method of multipliers and accelerated proximal gradient descent. Moreover, we provide the performance bound of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated for both synthetic and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "We consider the learning of multi-agent Hawkes processes, a model containing multiple Hawkes processes with shared endogenous impact functions and different exogenous intensities. In the framework of stochastic maximum likelihood estimation, we explore the associated risk bound. Further, we consider the superposition of Hawkes processes within the model, and demonstrate that under certain conditions such an operation is beneficial for tightening the risk bound. Accordingly, we propose a stochastic optimization algorithm assisted with a diversity-driven superposition strategy, achieving better learning results with improved convergence properties. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on synthetic data, and its potential to solve the cold-start problem of sequential recommendation systems is demonstrated on real-world data."}
{"text": "We provide a comprehensive overview and tooling for GP modeling with non-Gaussian likelihoods using state space methods. The state space formulation allows for solving one-dimensional GP models in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and memory complexity. While existing literature has focused on the connection between GP regression and state space methods, the computational primitives allowing for inference using general likelihoods in combination with the Laplace approximation (LA), variational Bayes (VB), and assumed density filtering (ADF, a.k.a. single-sweep expectation propagation, EP) schemes has been largely overlooked. We present means of combining the efficient $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ state space methodology with existing inference methods. We extend existing methods, and provide unifying code implementing all approaches."}
{"text": "Modeling complex conditional distributions is critical in a variety of settings. Despite a long tradition of research into conditional density estimation, current methods employ either simple parametric forms or are difficult to learn in practice. This paper employs normalising flows as a flexible likelihood model and presents an efficient method for fitting them to complex densities. These estimators must trade-off between modeling distributional complexity, functional complexity and heteroscedasticity without overfitting. We recognize these trade-offs as modeling decisions and develop a Bayesian framework for placing priors over these conditional density estimators using variational Bayesian neural networks. We evaluate this method on several small benchmark regression datasets, on some of which it obtains state of the art performance. Finally, we apply the method to two spatial density modeling tasks with over 1 million datapoints using the New York City yellow taxi dataset and the Chicago crime dataset."}
{"text": "Suppose that one particular block in a stochastic block model is of interest, but block labels are only observed for a few of the vertices in the network. Utilizing a graph realized from the model and the observed block labels, the vertex nomination task is to order the vertices with unobserved block labels into a ranked nomination list with the goal of having an abundance of interesting vertices near the top of the list. There are vertex nomination schemes in the literature, including the optimally precise canonical nomination scheme~$\\mathcal{L}^C$ and the consistent spectral partitioning nomination scheme~$\\mathcal{L}^P$. While the canonical nomination scheme $\\mathcal{L}^C$ is provably optimally precise, it is computationally intractable, being impractical to implement even on modestly sized graphs. With this in mind, an approximation of the canonical scheme---denoted the {\\it canonical sampling nomination scheme} $\\mathcal{L}^{CS}$---is introduced; $\\mathcal{L}^{CS}$ relies on a scalable, Markov chain Monte Carlo-based approximation of $\\mathcal{L}^{C}$, and converges to $\\mathcal{L}^{C}$ as the amount of sampling goes to infinity. The spectral partitioning nomination scheme is also extended to the {\\it extended spectral partitioning nomination scheme}, $\\mathcal{L}^{EP}$, which introduces a novel semisupervised clustering framework to improve upon the precision of $\\mathcal{L}^P$. Real-data and simulation experiments are employed to illustrate the precision of these vertex nomination schemes, as well as their empirical computational complexity.

{"text": "Modeling variability in tensor decomposition methods is one of the challenges of source separation. One possible solution to account for variations from one data set to another, jointly analysed, is to resort to the PARAFAC2 model. However, so far imposing constraints on the mode with variability has not been possible. In the following manuscript, a relaxation of the PARAFAC2 model is introduced, that allows for imposing nonnegativity constraints on the varying mode. An algorithm to compute the proposed flexible PARAFAC2 model is derived, and its performance is studied on both synthetic and chemometrics data."}
{"text": "The paper presents a novel approach to direct covariance function learning for Bayesian optimisation, with particular emphasis on experimental design problems where an existing corpus of condensed knowledge is present. The method presented borrows techniques from reproducing kernel Banach space theory (specifically m-kernels) and leverages them to convert (or re-weight) existing covariance functions into new, problem-specific covariance functions. The key advantage of this approach is that rather than relying on the user to manually select (with some hyperparameter tuning and experimentation) an appropriate covariance function it constructs the covariance function to specifically match the problem at hand. The technique is demonstrated on two real-world problems - specifically alloy design and short-polymer fibre manufacturing - as well as a selected test function."}
{"text": "Scaling Bayesian optimization to high dimensions is challenging task as the global optimization of high-dimensional acquisition function can be expensive and often infeasible. Existing methods depend either on limited active variables or the additive form of the objective function. We propose a new method for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, that uses a dropout strategy to optimize only a subset of variables at each iteration. We derive theoretical bounds for the regret and show how it can inform the derivation of our algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms for optimization on two benchmark functions and two real-world applications- training cascade classifiers and optimizing alloy composition."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose a new algorithm for streaming principal component analysis. With limited memory, small devices cannot store all the samples in the high-dimensional regime. Streaming principal component analysis aims to find the $k$-dimensional subspace which can explain the most variation of the $d$-dimensional data points that come into memory sequentially. In order to deal with large $d$ and large $N$ (number of samples), most streaming PCA algorithms update the current model using only the incoming sample and then dump the information right away to save memory. However the information contained in previously streamed data could be useful. Motivated by this idea, we develop a new streaming PCA algorithm called History PCA that achieves this goal. By using $O(Bd)$ memory with $B\\approx 10$ being the block size, our algorithm converges much faster than existing streaming PCA algorithms. By changing the number of inner iterations, the memory usage can be further reduced to $O(d)$ while maintaining a comparable convergence speed. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm along with the rate of convergence. We also demonstrate on synthetic and real world data sets that our algorithm compares favorably with other state-of-the-art streaming PCA methods in terms of the convergence speed and performance."}
{"text": "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) - one of the basic tools in data analysis - aims to find a coordinate system in which the components of the data are independent. Most popular ICA methods use kurtosis as a metric of non-Gaussianity to maximize, such as FastICA and JADE. However, their assumption of fourth-order moment (kurtosis) may not always be satisfied in practice. One of the possible solution is to use third-order moment (skewness) instead of kurtosis, which was applied in $ICA_{SG}$ and EcoICA.   In this paper we present a competitive approach to ICA based on the Split Generalized Gaussian distribution (SGGD), which is well adapted to heavy-tailed as well as asymmetric data. Consequently, we obtain a method which works better than the classical approaches, in both cases: heavy tails and non-symmetric data. \\end{abstract}"}
{"text": "We study optimal covariate balance for causal inferences from observational data when rich covariates and complex relationships necessitate flexible modeling with neural networks. Standard approaches such as propensity weighting and matching/balancing fail in such settings due to miscalibrated propensity nets and inappropriate covariate representations, respectively. We propose a new method based on adversarial training of a weighting and a discriminator network that effectively addresses this methodological gap. This is demonstrated through new theoretical characterizations of the method as well as empirical results using both fully connected architectures to learn complex relationships and convolutional architectures to handle image confounders, showing how this new method can enable strong causal analyses in these challenging settings."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel generative formulation of deep probabilistic models implementing \"soft\" constraints on their function dynamics. In particular, we develop a flexible methodological framework where the modeled functions and derivatives of a given order are subject to inequality or equality constraints. We then characterize the posterior distribution over model and constraint parameters through stochastic variational inference. As a result, the proposed approach allows for accurate and scalable uncertainty quantification on the predictions and on all parameters. We demonstrate the application of equality constraints in the challenging problem of parameter inference in ordinary differential equation models, while we showcase the application of inequality constraints on the problem of monotonic regression of count data. The proposed approach is extensively tested in several experimental settings, leading to highly competitive results in challenging modeling applications, while offering high expressiveness, flexibility and scalability."}
{"text": "While most classical approaches to Granger causality detection assume linear dynamics, many interactions in applied domains, like neuroscience and genomics, are inherently nonlinear. In these cases, using linear models may lead to inconsistent estimation of Granger causal interactions. We propose a class of nonlinear methods by applying structured multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights. By encouraging specific sets of weights to be zero---in particular through the use of convex group-lasso penalties---we can extract the Granger causal structure. To further contrast with traditional approaches, our framework naturally enables us to efficiently capture long-range dependencies between series either via our RNNs or through an automatic lag selection in the MLP. We show that our neural Granger causality methods outperform state-of-the-art nonlinear Granger causality methods on the DREAM3 challenge data. This data consists of nonlinear gene expression and regulation time courses with only a limited number of time points. The successes we show in this challenging dataset provide a powerful example of how deep learning can be useful in cases that go beyond prediction on large datasets. We likewise demonstrate our methods in detecting nonlinear interactions in a human motion capture dataset."}
{"text": "Measuring divergence between two distributions is essential in machine learning and statistics and has various applications including binary classification, change point detection, and two-sample test. Furthermore, in the era of big data, designing divergence measure that is interpretable and can handle high-dimensional and complex data becomes extremely important. In the paper, we propose a post selection inference (PSI) framework for divergence measure, which can select a set of statistically significant features that discriminate two distributions. Specifically, we employ an additive variant of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for features and introduce a general hypothesis test for PSI. A novel MMD estimator using the incomplete U-statistics, which has an asymptotically Normal distribution (under mild assumptions) and gives high detection power in PSI, is also proposed and analyzed theoretically. Through synthetic and real-world feature selection experiments, we show that the proposed framework can successfully detect statistically significant features. Last, we propose a sample selection framework for analyzing different members in the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) family."}
{"text": "Many popular dimensionality reduction procedures have out-of-sample extensions, which allow a practitioner to apply a learned embedding to observations not seen in the initial training sample. In this work, we consider the problem of obtaining an out-of-sample extension for the adjacency spectral embedding, a procedure for embedding the vertices of a graph into Euclidean space. We present two different approaches to this problem, one based on a least-squares objective and the other based on a maximum-likelihood formulation. We show that if the graph of interest is drawn according to a certain latent position model called a random dot product graph, then both of these out-of-sample extensions estimate the true latent position of the out-of-sample vertex with the same error rate. Further, we prove a central limit theorem for the least-squares-based extension, showing that the estimate is asymptotically normal about the truth in the large-graph limit."}
{"text": "We show that training a deep network using batch normalization is equivalent to approximate inference in Bayesian models. We further demonstrate that this finding allows us to make meaningful estimates of the model uncertainty using conventional architectures, without modifications to the network or the training procedure. Our approach is thoroughly validated by measuring the quality of uncertainty in a series of empirical experiments on different tasks. It outperforms baselines with strong statistical significance, and displays competitive performance with recent Bayesian approaches."}
{"text": "We study the problem of recovery of matrices that are simultaneously low rank and row and/or column sparse. Such matrices appear in recent applications in cognitive neuroscience, imaging, computer vision, macroeconomics, and genetics. We propose a GDT (Gradient Descent with hard Thresholding) algorithm to efficiently recover matrices with such structure, by minimizing a bi-convex function over a nonconvex set of constraints. We show linear convergence of the iterates obtained by GDT to a region within statistical error of an optimal solution. As an application of our method, we consider multi-task learning problems and show that the statistical error rate obtained by GDT is near optimal compared to minimax rate. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance and much faster running speed compared to existing methods, on both simulations and real data sets."}
{"text": "This paper is the first work to propose a network to predict a structured uncertainty distribution for a synthesized image. Previous approaches have been mostly limited to predicting diagonal covariance matrices. Our novel model learns to predict a full Gaussian covariance matrix for each reconstruction, which permits efficient sampling and likelihood evaluation.   We demonstrate that our model can accurately reconstruct ground truth correlated residual distributions for synthetic datasets and generate plausible high frequency samples for real face images. We also illustrate the use of these predicted covariances for structure preserving image denoising."}
{"text": "This paper considers the generation of prediction intervals (PIs) by neural networks for quantifying uncertainty in regression tasks. It is axiomatic that high-quality PIs should be as narrow as possible, whilst capturing a specified portion of data. We derive a loss function directly from this axiom that requires no distributional assumption. We show how its form derives from a likelihood principle, that it can be used with gradient descent, and that model uncertainty is accounted for in ensembled form. Benchmark experiments show the method outperforms current state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods, reducing average PI width by over 10%."}
{"text": "Multi-output regression models must exploit dependencies between outputs to maximise predictive performance. The application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to this setting typically yields models that are computationally demanding and have limited representational power. We present the Gaussian Process Autoregressive Regression (GPAR) model, a scalable multi-output GP model that is able to capture nonlinear, possibly input-varying, dependencies between outputs in a simple and tractable way: the product rule is used to decompose the joint distribution over the outputs into a set of conditionals, each of which is modelled by a standard GP. GPAR's efficacy is demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real-world problems, outperforming existing GP models and achieving state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks."}
{"text": "Convex sparsity-inducing regularizations are ubiquitous in high-dimensional machine learning, but solving the resulting optimization problems can be slow. To accelerate solvers, state-of-the-art approaches consist in reducing the size of the optimization problem at hand. In the context of regression, this can be achieved either by discarding irrelevant features (screening techniques) or by prioritizing features likely to be included in the support of the solution (working set techniques). Duality comes into play at several steps in these techniques. Here, we propose an extrapolation technique starting from a sequence of iterates in the dual that leads to the construction of improved dual points. This enables a tighter control of optimality as used in stopping criterion, as well as better screening performance of Gap Safe rules. Finally, we propose a working set strategy based on an aggressive use of Gap Safe screening rules. Thanks to our new dual point construction, we show significant computational speedups on multiple real-world problems."}
{"text": "We present a novel model architecture which leverages deep learning tools to perform exact Bayesian inference on sets of high dimensional, complex observations. Our model is provably exchangeable, meaning that the joint distribution over observations is invariant under permutation: this property lies at the heart of Bayesian inference. The model does not require variational approximations to train, and new samples can be generated conditional on previous samples, with cost linear in the size of the conditioning set. The advantages of our architecture are demonstrated on learning tasks that require generalisation from short observed sequences while modelling sequence variability, such as conditional image generation, few-shot learning, and anomaly detection."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of learning fair decision systems in complex scenarios in which a sensitive attribute might affect the decision along both fair and unfair pathways. We introduce a causal approach to disregard effects along unfair pathways that simplifies and generalizes previous literature. Our method corrects observations adversely affected by the sensitive attribute, and uses these to form a decision. This avoids disregarding fair information, and does not require an often intractable computation of the path-specific effect. We leverage recent developments in deep learning and approximate inference to achieve a solution that is widely applicable to complex, non-linear scenarios."}
{"text": "Distributional approaches to value-based reinforcement learning model the entire distribution of returns, rather than just their expected values, and have recently been shown to yield state-of-the-art empirical performance. This was demonstrated by the recently proposed C51 algorithm, based on categorical distributional reinforcement learning (CDRL) [Bellemare et al., 2017]. However, the theoretical properties of CDRL algorithms are not yet well understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework to analyse CDRL algorithms, establish the importance of the projected distributional Bellman operator in distributional RL, draw fundamental connections between CDRL and the Cram\\'er distance, and give a proof of convergence for sample-based categorical distributional reinforcement learning algorithms."}
{"text": "We present the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model (CGPCM), a doubly nonparametric model for causal, spectrally complex dynamical phenomena. The CGPCM is a generative model in which white noise is passed through a causal, nonparametric-window moving-average filter, a construction that we show to be equivalent to a Gaussian process with a nonparametric kernel that is biased towards causally-generated signals. We develop enhanced variational inference and learning schemes for the CGPCM and its previous acausal variant, the GPCM (Tobar et al., 2015b), that significantly improve statistical accuracy. These modelling and inferential contributions are demonstrated on a range of synthetic and real-world signals."}
{"text": "We propose a novel approach to parameter estimation for simulator-based statistical models with intractable likelihood. Our proposed method involves recursive application of kernel ABC and kernel herding to the same observed data. We provide a theoretical explanation regarding why the approach works, showing (for the population setting) that, under a certain assumption, point estimates obtained with this method converge to the true parameter, as recursion proceeds. We have conducted a variety of numerical experiments, including parameter estimation for a real-world pedestrian flow simulator, and show that in most cases our method outperforms existing approaches."}
{"text": "Determinantal point processes (DPPs) enable the modeling of repulsion: they provide diverse sets of points. The repulsion is encoded in a kernel $K$ that can be seen as a matrix storing the similarity between points. The diversity comes from the fact that the inclusion probability of a subset is equal to the determinant of a submatrice of $K$. The exact algorithm to sample DPPs uses the spectral decomposition of $K$, a computation that becomes costly when dealing with a high number of points. Here, we present an alternative exact algorithm in the discrete setting that avoids the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors computation. Instead, it relies on Cholesky decompositions. This is a two steps strategy: first, it samples a Bernoulli point process with an appropriate distribution, then it samples the target DPP distribution through a thinning procedure. Not only is the method used here innovative, but this algorithm can be competitive with the original algorithm or even faster for some applications specified below."}
{"text": "Predictive models that generalize well under distributional shift are often desirable and sometimes crucial to building robust and reliable machine learning applications. We focus on distributional shift that arises in causal inference from observational data and in unsupervised domain adaptation. We pose both of these problems as prediction under a shift in design. Popular methods for overcoming distributional shift make unrealistic assumptions such as having a well-specified model or knowing the policy that gave rise to the observed data. Other methods are hindered by their need for a pre-specified metric for comparing observations, or by poor asymptotic properties. We devise a bound on the generalization error under design shift, incorporating both representation learning and sample re-weighting. Based on the bound, we propose an algorithmic framework that does not require any of the above assumptions and which is asymptotically consistent. We empirically study the new framework using two synthetic datasets, and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to previous methods."}
{"text": "The multiresolution Gaussian process (GP) has gained increasing attention as a viable approach towards improving the quality of approximations in GPs that scale well to large-scale data. Most of the current constructions assume full independence across resolutions. This assumption simplifies the inference, but it underestimates the uncertainties in transitioning from one resolution to another. This in turn results in models which are prone to overfitting in the sense of excessive sensitivity to the chosen resolution, and predictions which are non-smooth at the boundaries. Our contribution is a new construction which instead assumes conditional independence among GPs across resolutions. We show that relaxing the full independence assumption enables robustness against overfitting, and that it delivers predictions that are smooth at the boundaries. Our new model is compared against current state of the art on 2 synthetic and 9 real-world datasets. In most cases, our new conditionally independent construction performed favorably when compared against models based on the full independence assumption. In particular, it exhibits little to no signs of overfitting."}
{"text": "Modern supervised machine learning algorithms involve hyperparameters that have to be set before running them. Options for setting hyperparameters are default values from the software package, manual configuration by the user or configuring them for optimal predictive performance by a tuning procedure. The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we formalize the problem of tuning from a statistical point of view, define data-based defaults and suggest general measures quantifying the tunability of hyperparameters of algorithms. Secondly, we conduct a large-scale benchmarking study based on 38 datasets from the OpenML platform and six common machine learning algorithms. We apply our measures to assess the tunability of their parameters. Our results yield default values for hyperparameters and enable users to decide whether it is worth conducting a possibly time consuming tuning strategy, to focus on the most important hyperparameters and to chose adequate hyperparameter spaces for tuning."}
{"text": "Latent variable models with hidden binary units appear in various applications. Learning such models, in particular in the presence of noise, is a challenging computational problem. In this paper we propose a novel spectral approach to this problem, based on the eigenvectors of both the second order moment matrix and third order moment tensor of the observed data. We prove that under mild non-degeneracy conditions, our method consistently estimates the model parameters at the optimal parametric rate. Our tensor-based method generalizes previous orthogonal tensor decomposition approaches, where the hidden units were assumed to be either statistically independent or mutually exclusive. We illustrate the consistency of our method on simulated data and demonstrate its usefulness in learning a common model for population mixtures in genetics."}

{"text": "Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words of the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a \"global\" cost to every such transport, using the \"local\" consideration of how much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications."}
{"text": "This paper presents a novel formulation and solution of orbit determination over finite time horizons as a learning problem. We present an approach to orbit determination under very broad conditions that are satisfied for n-body problems. These weak conditions allow us to perform orbit determination with noisy and highly non-linear observations such as those presented by range-rate only (Doppler only) observations. We show that domain generalization and distribution regression techniques can learn to estimate orbits of a group of satellites and identify individual satellites especially with prior understanding of correlations between orbits and provide asymptotic convergence conditions. The approach presented requires only visibility and observability of the underlying state from observations and is particularly useful for autonomous spacecraft operations using low-cost ground stations or sensors. We validate the orbit determination approach using observations of two spacecraft (GRIFEX and MCubed-2) along with synthetic datasets of multiple spacecraft deployments and lunar orbits. We also provide a comparison with the standard techniques (EKF) under highly noisy conditions."}
{"text": "We develop theory for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR). A number of NLDR methods have been developed, but there is limited understanding of how these methods work and the relationships between them. There is limited basis for using existing NLDR theory for deriving new algorithms. We provide a novel framework for analysis of NLDR via a connection to the statistical theory of linear smoothers. This allows us to both understand existing methods and derive new ones. We use this connection to smoothing to show that asymptotically, existing NLDR methods correspond to discrete approximations of the solutions of sets of differential equations given a boundary condition. In particular, we can characterize many existing methods in terms of just three limiting differential operators and boundary conditions. Our theory also provides a way to assert that one method is preferable to another; indeed, we show Local Tangent Space Alignment is superior within a class of methods that assume a global coordinate chart defines an isometric embedding of the manifold."}
{"text": "We propose practical extensions to Bayesian optimization for solving dynamic problems. We model dynamic objective functions using spatiotemporal Gaussian process priors which capture all the instances of the functions over time. Our extensions to Bayesian optimization use the information learnt from this model to guide the tracking of a temporally evolving minimum. By exploiting temporal correlations, the proposed method also determines when to make evaluations, how fast to make those evaluations, and it induces an appropriate budget of steps based on the available information. Lastly, we evaluate our technique on synthetic and real-world problems."}
{"text": "Consider an unknown smooth function $f: [0,1]^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, and say we are given $n$ noisy mod 1 samples of $f$, i.e., $y_i = (f(x_i) + \\eta_i)\\mod 1$, for $x_i \\in [0,1]^d$, where $\\eta_i$ denotes the noise. Given the samples $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^{n}$, our goal is to recover smooth, robust estimates of the clean samples $f(x_i) \\bmod 1$. We formulate a natural approach for solving this problem, which works with angular embeddings of the noisy mod 1 samples over the unit circle, inspired by the angular synchronization framework. This amounts to solving a smoothness regularized least-squares problem -- a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) -- where the variables are constrained to lie on the unit circle. Our approach is based on solving its relaxation, which is a trust-region sub-problem and hence solvable efficiently. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating its robustness to noise for adversarial, and random Gaussian and Bernoulli noise models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such theoretical results for this problem. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic data, along with a simple least-squares solution for the unwrapping stage, that recovers the original samples of $f$ (up to a global shift). It is shown to perform well at high levels of noise, when taking as input the denoised modulo $1$ samples.   Finally, we also consider two other approaches for denoising the modulo 1 samples that leverage tools from Riemannian optimization on manifolds, including a Burer-Monteiro approach for a semidefinite programming relaxation of our formulation. For the two-dimensional version of the problem, which has applications in radar interferometry, we are able to solve instances of real-world data with a million sample points in under 10 seconds, on a personal laptop."}
{"text": "This paper presents approximate confidence intervals for each function of parameters in a Banach space based on a bootstrap algorithm. We apply kernel density approach to estimate the persistence landscape. In addition, we evaluate the quality distribution function estimator of random variables using integrated mean square error (IMSE). The results of simulation studies show a significant improvement achieved by our approach compared to the standard version of confidence intervals algorithm. In the next step, we provide several algorithms to solve our model. Finally, real data analysis shows that the accuracy of our method compared to that of previous works for computing the confidence interval."}
{"text": "Ordinary stochastic neural networks mostly rely on the expected values of their weights to make predictions, whereas the induced noise is mostly used to capture the uncertainty, prevent overfitting and slightly boost the performance through test-time averaging. In this paper, we introduce variance layers, a different kind of stochastic layers. Each weight of a variance layer follows a zero-mean distribution and is only parameterized by its variance. We show that such layers can learn surprisingly well, can serve as an efficient exploration tool in reinforcement learning tasks and provide a decent defense against adversarial attacks. We also show that a number of conventional Bayesian neural networks naturally converge to such zero-mean posteriors. We observe that in these cases such zero-mean parameterization leads to a much better training objective than conventional parameterizations where the mean is being learned."}
{"text": "We provide sharp empirical estimates of expectation, variance and normal approximation for a class of statistics whose variation in any argument does not change too much when another argument is modified. Examples of such weak interactions are furnished by U- and V-statistics, Lipschitz L-statistics and various error functionals of L2-regularized algorithms and Gibbs algorithms."}
{"text": "We present the first framework for Gaussian-process-modulated Poisson processes when the temporal data appear in the form of panel counts. Panel count data frequently arise when experimental subjects are observed only at discrete time points and only the numbers of occurrences of the events between subsequent observation times are available. The exact occurrence timestamps of the events are unknown. The method of conducting the efficient variational inference is presented, based on the assumption of a Gaussian-process-modulated intensity function. We derive a tractable lower bound to alleviate the problems of the intractable evidence lower bound inherent in the variational inference framework. Our algorithm outperforms classical methods on both synthetic and three real panel count sets."}
{"text": "In conventional ODE modelling coefficients of an equation driving the system state forward in time are estimated. However, for many complex systems it is practically impossible to determine the equations or interactions governing the underlying dynamics. In these settings, parametric ODE model cannot be formulated. Here, we overcome this issue by introducing a novel paradigm of nonparametric ODE modelling that can learn the underlying dynamics of arbitrary continuous-time systems without prior knowledge. We propose to learn non-linear, unknown differential functions from state observations using Gaussian process vector fields within the exact ODE formalism. We demonstrate the model's capabilities to infer dynamics from sparse data and to simulate the system forward into future."}
{"text": "We propose a simulation method for multidimensional Hawkes processes based on superposition theory of point processes. This formulation allows us to design efficient simulations for Hawkes processes with differing exponentially decaying intensities. We demonstrate that inter-arrival times can be decomposed into simpler auxiliary variables that can be sampled directly, giving exact simulation with no approximation. We establish that the auxiliary variables provides information on the parent process for each event time. The algorithm correctness is shown by verifying the simulated intensities with their theoretical moments. A modular inference procedure consisting of Gibbs samplers through the auxiliary variable augmentation and adaptive rejection sampling is presented. Finally, we compare our proposed simulation method against existing methods, and find significant improvement in terms of algorithm speed. Our inference algorithm is used to discover the strengths of mutually excitations in real dark networks."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose to tackle the problem of reducing discrepancies between multiple domains referred to as multi-source domain adaptation and consider it under the target shift assumption: in all domains we aim to solve a classification problem with the same output classes, but with labels' proportions differing across them. This problem, generally ignored in the vast majority papers on domain adaptation papers, is nevertheless critical in real-world applications, and we theoretically show its impact on the adaptation success. To address this issue, we design a method based on optimal transport, a theory that has been successfully used to tackle adaptation problems in machine learning. Our method performs multi-source adaptation and target shift correction simultaneously by learning the class probabilities of the unlabeled target sample and the coupling allowing to align two (or more) probability distributions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data related to satellite image segmentation task show the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art."}
{"text": "A new causal discovery method, Structural Agnostic Modeling (SAM), is presented in this paper. Leveraging both conditional independencies and distributional asymmetries in the data, SAM aims to find the underlying causal structure from observational data. The approach is based on a game between different players estimating each variable distribution conditionally to the others as a neural net, and an adversary aimed at discriminating the overall joint conditional distribution, and that of the original data. A learning criterion combining distribution estimation, sparsity and acyclicity constraints is used to enforce the end-to-end optimization of the graph structure and parameters through stochastic gradient descent. Besides a theoretical analysis of the approach in the large sample limit, SAM is extensively experimentally validated on synthetic and real data."}
{"text": "Zero-inflated datasets, which have an excess of zero outputs, are commonly encountered in problems such as climate or rare event modelling. Conventional machine learning approaches tend to overestimate the non-zeros leading to poor performance. We propose a novel model family of zero-inflated Gaussian processes (ZiGP) for such zero-inflated datasets, produced by sparse kernels through learning a latent probit Gaussian process that can zero out kernel rows and columns whenever the signal is absent. The ZiGPs are particularly useful for making the powerful Gaussian process networks more interpretable. We introduce sparse GP networks where variable-order latent modelling is achieved through sparse mixing signals. We derive the non-trivial stochastic variational inference tractably for scalable learning of the sparse kernels in both models. The novel output-sparse approach improves both prediction of zero-inflated data and interpretability of latent mixing models."}
{"text": "Probabilistic graphical models are a key tool in machine learning applications. Computing the partition function, i.e., normalizing constant, is a fundamental task of statistical inference but it is generally computationally intractable, leading to extensive study of approximation methods. Iterative variational methods are a popular and successful family of approaches. However, even state of the art variational methods can return poor results or fail to converge on difficult instances. In this paper, we instead consider computing the partition function via sequential summation over variables. We develop robust approximate algorithms by combining ideas from mini-bucket elimination with tensor network and renormalization group methods from statistical physics. The resulting \"convergence-free\" methods show good empirical performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmark models, even for difficult instances."}
{"text": "Uplift modeling is aimed at estimating the incremental impact of an action on an individual's behavior, which is useful in various application domains such as targeted marketing (advertisement campaigns) and personalized medicine (medical treatments). Conventional methods of uplift modeling require every instance to be jointly equipped with two types of labels: the taken action and its outcome. However, obtaining two labels for each instance at the same time is difficult or expensive in many real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method of uplift modeling that is applicable to a more practical setting where only one type of labels is available for each instance. We show a mean squared error bound for the proposed estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments."}
{"text": "Recent efforts on combining deep models with probabilistic graphical models are promising in providing flexible models that are also easy to interpret. We propose a variational message-passing algorithm for variational inference in such models. We make three contributions. First, we propose structured inference networks that incorporate the structure of the graphical model in the inference network of variational auto-encoders (VAE). Second, we establish conditions under which such inference networks enable fast amortized inference similar to VAE. Finally, we derive a variational message passing algorithm to perform efficient natural-gradient inference while retaining the efficiency of the amortized inference. By simultaneously enabling structured, amortized, and natural-gradient inference for deep structured models, our method simplifies and generalizes existing methods."}
{"text": "Lactate threshold is considered an essential parameter when assessing performance of elite and recreational runners and prescribing training intensities in endurance sports. However, the measurement of blood lactate concentration requires expensive equipment and the extraction of blood samples, which are inconvenient for frequent monitoring. Furthermore, most recreational runners do not have access to routine assessment of their physical fitness by the aforementioned equipment so they are not able to calculate the lactate threshold without resorting to an expensive and specialized centre. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to create an intelligent system capable of estimating the lactate threshold of recreational athletes participating in endurance running sports. The solution here proposed is based on a machine learning system which models the lactate evolution using recurrent neural networks and includes the proposal of standardization of the temporal axis as well as a modification of the stratified sampling method. The results show that the proposed system accurately estimates the lactate threshold of 89.52% of the athletes and its correlation with the experimentally measured lactate threshold is very high (R=0,89). Moreover, its behaviour with the test dataset is as good as with the training set, meaning that the generalization power of the model is high. Therefore, in this study a machine learning based system is proposed as alternative to the traditional invasive lactate threshold measurement tests for recreational runners."}
{"text": "We propose a novel class of network models for temporal dyadic interaction data. Our goal is to capture a number of important features often observed in social interactions: sparsity, degree heterogeneity, community structure and reciprocity. We propose a family of models based on self-exciting Hawkes point processes in which events depend on the history of the process. The key component is the conditional intensity function of the Hawkes Process, which captures the fact that interactions may arise as a response to past interactions (reciprocity), or due to shared interests between individuals (community structure). In order to capture the sparsity and degree heterogeneity, the base (non time dependent) part of the intensity function builds on compound random measures following Todeschini et al. (2016). We conduct experiments on a variety of real-world temporal interaction data and show that the proposed model outperforms many competing approaches for link prediction, and leads to interpretable parameters."}
{"text": "In the framework of the supervised learning of a real function defined on a space X , the so called Kriging method stands on a real Gaussian field defined on X. The Euclidean case is well known and has been widely studied. In this paper, we explore the less classical case where X is the non commutative finite group of permutations. In this setting, we propose and study an harmonic analysis of the covariance operators that enables to consider Gaussian processes models and forecasting issues. Our theory is motivated by statistical ranking problems."}
{"text": "Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising approach for understanding uncertainty and structure in matrix data. However, a large volume of applied work optimizes traditional non-Bayesian NMF objectives that fail to provide a principled understanding of the non-identifiability inherent in NMF-- an issue ideally addressed by a Bayesian approach. Despite their suitability, current Bayesian NMF approaches have failed to gain popularity in an applied setting; they sacrifice flexibility in modeling for tractable computation, tend to get stuck in local modes, and require many thousands of samples for meaningful uncertainty estimates. We address these issues through a particle-based variational approach to Bayesian NMF that only requires the joint likelihood to be differentiable for tractability, uses a novel initialization technique to identify multiple modes in the posterior, and allows domain experts to inspect a `small' set of factorizations that faithfully represent the posterior. We introduce and employ a class of likelihood and prior distributions for NMF that formulate a Bayesian model using popular non-Bayesian NMF objectives. On several real datasets, we obtain better particle approximations to the Bayesian NMF posterior in less time than baselines and demonstrate the significant role that multimodality plays in NMF-related tasks."}
{"text": "In this paper, we investigate the capability of the universal Kriging (UK) model for single-objective global optimization applied within an efficient global optimization (EGO) framework. We implemented this combined UK-EGO framework and studied four variants of the UK methods, that is, a UK with a first-order polynomial, a UK with a second-order polynomial, a blind Kriging (BK) implementation from the ooDACE toolbox, and a polynomial-chaos Kriging (PCK) implementation. The UK-EGO framework with automatic trend function selection derived from the BK and PCK models works by building a UK surrogate model and then performing optimizations via expected improvement criteria on the Kriging model with the lowest leave-one-out cross-validation error. Next, we studied and compared the UK-EGO variants and standard EGO using five synthetic test functions and one aerodynamic problem. Our results show that the proper choice for the trend function through automatic feature selection can improve the optimization performance of UK-EGO relative to EGO. From our results, we found that PCK-EGO was the best variant, as it had more robust performance as compared to the rest of the UK-EGO schemes; however, total-order expansion should be used to generate the candidate trend function set for high-dimensional problems. Note that, for some test functions, the UK with predetermined polynomial trend functions performed better than that of BK and PCK, indicating that the use of automatic trend function selection does not always lead to the best quality solutions. We also found that although some variants of UK are not as globally accurate as the ordinary Kriging (OK), they can still identify better-optimized solutions due to the addition of the trend function, which helps the optimizer locate the global optimum."}
{"text": "In data science, determining proximity between observations is critical to many downstream analyses such as clustering, information retrieval and classification. However, when the underlying structure of the data probability space is unclear, the function used to compute similarity between data points is often arbitrarily chosen. Here, we present a novel concept of proximity, Semblance, that uses the empirical distribution across all observations to inform the similarity between each pair. The advantage of Semblance lies in its distribution free formulation and its ability to detect niche features by placing greater emphasis on similarity between observation pairs that fall at the outskirts of the data distribution, as opposed to those that fall towards the center. We prove that Semblance is a valid Mercer kernel, thus allowing its principled use in kernel based learning machines. Semblance can be applied to any data modality, and we demonstrate its consistently improved performance against conventional methods through simulations and three real case studies from very different applications, viz. cell type classification using single cell RNA sequencing, selecting predictors of positive return on real estate investments, and image compression."}
{"text": "Spectral features of the empirical moment matrix constitute a resourceful tool for unveiling properties of a cloud of points, among which, density, support and latent structures. It is already well known that the empirical moment matrix encodes a great deal of subtle attributes of the underlying measure. Starting from this object as base of observations we combine ideas from statistics, real algebraic geometry, orthogonal polynomials and approximation theory for opening new insights relevant for Machine Learning (ML) problems with data supported on singular sets. Refined concepts and results from real algebraic geometry and approximation theory are empowering a simple tool (the empirical moment matrix) for the task of solving non-trivial questions in data analysis. We provide (1) theoretical support, (2) numerical experiments and, (3) connections to real world data as a validation of the stamina of the empirical moment matrix approach."}
{"text": "Neuroscientists have enjoyed much success in understanding brain functions by constructing brain connectivity networks using data collected under highly controlled experimental settings. However, these experimental settings bear little resemblance to our real-life experience in day-to-day interactions with the surroundings. To address this issue, neuroscientists have been measuring brain activity under natural viewing experiments in which the subjects are given continuous stimuli, such as watching a movie or listening to a story. The main challenge with this approach is that the measured signal consists of both the stimulus-induced signal, as well as intrinsic-neural and non-neuronal signals. By exploiting the experimental design, we propose to estimate stimulus-locked brain network by treating non-stimulus-induced signals as nuisance parameters. In many neuroscience applications, it is often important to identify brain regions that are connected to many other brain regions during cognitive process. We propose an inferential method to test whether the maximum degree of the estimated network is larger than a pre-specific number. We prove that the type I error can be controlled and that the power increases to one asymptotically. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of our method. Finally, we analyze a functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset obtained under the Sherlock Holmes movie stimuli."}
{"text": "This paper presents a simulation free framework for solving reliability analysis problems. The method proposed is rooted in a recently developed deep learning approach, referred to as the physics-informed neural network. The primary idea is to learn the neural network parameters directly from the physics of the problem. With this, the need for running simulation and generating data is completely eliminated. Additionally, the proposed approach also satisfies physical laws such as invariance properties and conservation laws associated with the problem. The proposed approach is used for solving three benchmark reliability analysis problems. Results obtained illustrates that the proposed approach is highly accurate. Moreover, the primary bottleneck of solving reliability analysis problems, i.e., running expensive simulations to generate data, is eliminated with this method."}
