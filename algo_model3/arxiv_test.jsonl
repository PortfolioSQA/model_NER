{"text": "We present a novel approach for fully non-stationary Gaussian process regression (GPR), where all three key parameters -- noise variance, signal variance and lengthscale -- can be simultaneously input-dependent. We develop gradient-based inference methods to learn the unknown function and the non-stationary model parameters, without requiring any model approximations. We propose to infer full parameter posterior with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which conveniently extends the analytical gradient-based GPR learning by guiding the sampling with model gradients. We also learn the MAP solution from the posterior by gradient ascent. In experiments on several synthetic datasets and in modelling of temporal gene expression, the nonstationary GPR is shown to be necessary for modeling realistic input-dependent dynamics, while it performs comparably to conventional stationary or previous non-stationary GPR models otherwise."}
{"text": "We are interested in solving the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem for instances, where the underlying sparsity pattern exhibit spatio-temporal structure motivated by the electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization problem. We propose a probabilistic model that takes this structure into account by generalizing the structured spike and slab prior and the associated Expectation Propagation inference scheme. Based on numerical experiments, we demonstrate the viability of the model and the approximate inference scheme."}
{"text": "Distance weighted discrimination (DWD) is a margin-based classifier with an interesting geometric motivation. DWD was originally proposed as a superior alternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be popular compared with the SVM. The main reasons are twofold. First, the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone programming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is much more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD mainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting and data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency of DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work, we advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and theoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving DWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing state-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can handle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a special DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural kernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel DWD. We compare DWD and the SVM on several benchmark data sets and show that the two have comparable classification accuracy, but DWD equipped with our new algorithm can be much faster to compute than the SVM."}
{"text": "A general approach for anomaly detection or novelty detection consists in estimating high density regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates. Results on actual data sets are also presented."}
{"text": "While stochastic variational inference is relatively well known for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models, related methods also offer ways to circumnavigate the approximation of analytically intractable expectations. The key challenge in either setting is controlling the variance of gradient estimates: recent work has shown that for continuous latent variables, particularly multivariate Gaussians, this can be achieved by using the gradient of the log posterior. In this paper we apply the same idea to gamma distributed latent variables given gamma variational distributions, enabling straightforward \"black box\" variational inference in models where sparsity and non-negativity are appropriate. We demonstrate the method on a recently proposed gamma process model for network data, as well as a novel sparse factor analysis. We outperform generic sampling algorithms and the approach of using Gaussian variational distributions on transformed variables."}
{"text": "This text investigates relations between two well-known family of algorithms, matrix factorisations and recursive linear filters, by describing a probabilistic model in which approximate inference corresponds to a matrix factorisation algorithm. Using the probabilistic model, we derive a matrix factorisation algorithm as a recursive linear filter. More precisely, we derive a matrix-variate recursive linear filter in order to perform efficient inference in high dimensions. We also show that it is possible to interpret our algorithm as a nontrivial stochastic gradient algorithm. Demonstrations and comparisons on an image restoration task are given."}
{"text": "Large sample size brings the computation bottleneck for modern data analysis. Subsampling is one of efficient strategies to handle this problem. In previous studies, researchers make more fo- cus on subsampling with replacement (SSR) than on subsampling without replacement (SSWR). In this paper we investigate a kind of SSWR, poisson subsampling (PSS), for fast algorithm in ordinary least-square problem. We establish non-asymptotic property, i.e, the error bound of the correspond- ing subsample estimator, which provide a tradeoff between computation cost and approximation efficiency. Besides the non-asymptotic result, we provide asymptotic consistency and normality of the subsample estimator. Methodologically, we propose a two-step subsampling algorithm, which is efficient with respect to a statistical objective and independent on the linear model assumption.. Synthetic and real data are used to empirically study our proposed subsampling strategies. We argue by these empirical studies that, (1) our proposed two-step algorithm has obvious advantage when the assumed linear model does not accurate, and (2) the PSS strategy performs obviously better than SSR when the subsampling ratio increases."}
{"text": "In this paper, we focus on the stochastic block model (SBM),a probabilistic tool describing interactions between nodes of a network using latent clusters. The SBM assumes that the networkhas a stationary structure, in which connections of time varying intensity are not taken into account. In other words, interactions between two groups are forced to have the same features during the whole observation time. To overcome this limitation,we propose a partition of the whole time horizon, in which interactions are observed, and develop a non stationary extension of the SBM,allowing to simultaneously cluster the nodes in a network along with fixed time intervals in which the interactions take place. The number of clusters (K for nodes, D for time intervals) as well as the class memberships are finallyobtained through maximizing the complete-data integrated likelihood by means of a greedy search approach. After showing that the model works properly with simulated data, we focus on a real data set. We thus consider the three days ACM Hypertext conference held in Turin,June 29th - July 1st 2009. Proximity interactions between attendees during the first day are modelled and an interestingclustering of the daily hours is finally obtained, with times of social gathering (e.g. coffee breaks) recovered by the approach. Applications to large networks are limited due to the computational complexity of the greedy search which is dominated bythe number $K\\_{max}$ and $D\\_{max}$ of clusters used in the initialization. Therefore,advanced clustering tools are considered to reduce the number of clusters expected in the data, making the greedy search applicable to large networks."}
{"text": "We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We show that finding the best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression. We also show that, under some asumptions, universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization remains possible using the MAPE."}
{"text": "Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is a class of online margin-based algorithms suitable for a wide range of real-time prediction tasks, including classification and regression. PA algorithms are formulated in terms of deterministic point-estimation problems governed by a set of user-defined hyperparameters: the approach fails to capture model/prediction uncertainty and makes their performance highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. In this paper, we introduce a novel PA learning framework for regression that overcomes the above limitations. We contribute a Bayesian state-space interpretation of PA regression, along with a novel online variational inference scheme, that not only produces probabilistic predictions, but also offers the benefit of automatic hyperparameter tuning. Experiments with various real-world data sets show that our approach performs significantly better than a more standard, linear Gaussian state-space model."}
{"text": "We propose a second-order (Hessian or Hessian-free) based optimization method for variational inference inspired by Gaussian backpropagation, and argue that quasi-Newton optimization can be developed as well. This is accomplished by generalizing the gradient computation in stochastic backpropagation via a reparametrization trick with lower complexity. As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to the problems of Bayesian logistic regression and variational auto-encoder (VAE). Additionally, we compute bounds on the estimator variance of intractable expectations for the family of Lipschitz continuous function. Our method is practical, scalable and model free. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets and provide comparisons with other stochastic gradient methods to show substantial enhancement in convergence rates."}
{"text": "In this study, we propose an automatic learning method for variables selection based on Lasso in epidemiology context. One of the aim of this approach is to overcome the pretreatment of experts in medicine and epidemiology on collected data. These pretreatment consist in recoding some variables and to choose some interactions based on expertise. The approach proposed uses all available explanatory variables without treatment and generate automatically all interactions between them. This lead to high dimension. We use Lasso, one of the robust methods of variable selection in high dimension. To avoid over fitting a two levels cross-validation is used. Because the target variable is account variable and the lasso estimators are biased, variables selected by lasso are debiased by a GLM and used to predict the distribution of the main vector of malaria which is Anopheles. Results show that only few climatic and environmental variables are the mains factors associated to the malaria risk exposure."}
{"text": "Using a proper model to characterize a time series is crucial in making accurate predictions. In this work we use time-varying autoregressive process (TVAR) to describe non-stationary time series and model it as a mixture of multiple stable autoregressive (AR) processes. We introduce a new model selection technique based on Gap statistics to learn the appropriate number of AR filters needed to model a time series. We define a new distance measure between stable AR filters and draw a reference curve that is used to measure how much adding a new AR filter improves the performance of the model, and then choose the number of AR filters that has the maximum gap with the reference curve. To that end, we propose a new method in order to generate uniform random stable AR filters in root domain. Numerical results are provided demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach."}
{"text": "We study the restless bandit associated with an extremely simple scalar Kalman filter model in discrete time. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the problem is indexable in the sense that the Whittle index is a non-decreasing function of the relevant belief state. In spite of the long history of this problem, this appears to be the first such proof. We use results about Schur-convexity and mechanical words, which are particular binary strings intimately related to palindromes."}
{"text": "We propose Macau, a powerful and flexible Bayesian factorization method for heterogeneous data. Our model can factorize any set of entities and relations that can be represented by a relational model, including tensors and also multiple relations for each entity. Macau can also incorporate side information, specifically entity and relation features, which are crucial for predicting sparsely observed relations. Macau scales to millions of entity instances, hundred millions of observations, and sparse entity features with millions of dimensions. To achieve the scale up, we specially designed sampling procedure for entity and relation features that relies primarily on noise injection in linear regressions. We show performance and advanced features of Macau in a set of experiments, including challenging drug-protein activity prediction task."}
{"text": "This paper addresses the problem of scalable optimization for L1-regularized conditional Gaussian graphical models. Conditional Gaussian graphical models generalize the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional distributions to model the output network influenced by conditioning input variables. While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation, state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly, fail due to memory constraints for very large problems. In this paper, we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently iterates over two sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared to the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems under memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show that our methods can solve one million dimensional problems to high accuracy in a little over a day on a single machine."}
{"text": "Tree structures are ubiquitous in data across many domains, and many datasets are naturally modelled by unobserved tree structures. In this paper, first we review the theory of random fragmentation processes [Bertoin, 2006], and a number of existing methods for modelling trees, including the popular nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP). Then we define a general class of probability distributions over trees: the Dirichlet fragmentation process (DFP) through a novel combination of the theory of Dirichlet processes and random fragmentation processes. This DFP presents a stick-breaking construction, and relates to the nCRP in the same way the Dirichlet process relates to the Chinese restaurant process. Furthermore, we develop a novel hierarchical mixture model with the DFP, and empirically compare the new model to similar models in machine learning. Experiments show the DFP mixture model to be convincingly better than existing state-of-the-art approaches for hierarchical clustering and density modelling."}
{"text": "In this paper we develop a statistical theory and an implementation of deep learning models. We show that an elegant variable splitting scheme for the alternating direction method of multipliers optimises a deep learning objective. We allow for non-smooth non-convex regularisation penalties to induce sparsity in parameter weights. We provide a link between traditional shallow layer statistical models such as principal component and sliced inverse regression and deep layer models. We also define the degrees of freedom of a deep learning predictor and a predictive MSE criteria to perform model selection for comparing architecture designs. We focus on deep multiclass logistic learning although our methods apply more generally. Our results suggest an interesting and previously under-exploited relationship between deep learning and proximal splitting techniques. To illustrate our methodology, we provide a multi-class logit classification analysis of Fisher's Iris data where we illustrate the convergence of our algorithm. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research."}
{"text": "Given i.i.d samples from some unknown continuous density on hyper-rectangle $[0, 1]^d$, we attempt to learn a piecewise constant function that approximates this underlying density non-parametrically. Our density estimate is defined on a binary split of $[0, 1]^d$ and built up sequentially according to discrepancy criteria; the key ingredient is to control the discrepancy adaptively in each sub-rectangle to achieve overall bound. We prove that the estimate, even though simple as it appears, preserves most of the estimation power. By exploiting its structure, it can be directly applied to some important pattern recognition tasks such as mode seeking and density landscape exploration. We demonstrate its applicability through simulations and examples."}
{"text": "We briefly review recent progress in techniques for modeling and analyzing hyperspectral images and movies, in particular for detecting plumes of both known and unknown chemicals. For detecting chemicals of known spectrum, we extend the technique of using a single subspace for modeling the background to a \"mixture of subspaces\" model to tackle more complicated background. Furthermore, we use partial least squares regression on a resampled training set to boost performance. For the detection of unknown chemicals we view the problem as an anomaly detection problem, and use novel estimators with low-sampled complexity for intrinsically low-dimensional data in high-dimensions that enable us to model the \"normal\" spectra and detect anomalies. We apply these algorithms to benchmark data sets made available by the Automated Target Detection program co-funded by NSF, DTRA and NGA, and compare, when applicable, to current state-of-the-art algorithms, with favorable results."}
{"text": "We consider continuous time Markovian processes where populations of individual agents interact stochastically according to kinetic rules. Despite the increasing prominence of such models in fields ranging from biology to smart cities, Bayesian inference for such systems remains challenging, as these are continuous time, discrete state systems with potentially infinite state-space. Here we propose a novel efficient algorithm for joint state / parameter posterior sampling in population Markov Jump processes. We introduce a class of pseudo-marginal sampling algorithms based on a random truncation method which enables a principled treatment of infinite state spaces. Extensive evaluation on a number of benchmark models shows that this approach achieves considerable savings compared to state of the art methods, retaining accuracy and fast convergence. We also present results on a synthetic biology data set showing the potential for practical usefulness of our work."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of transforming samples from one continuous source distribution into samples from another target distribution. We demonstrate with optimal transport theory that when the source distribution can be easily sampled from and the target distribution is log-concave, this can be tractably solved with convex optimization. We show that a special case of this, when the source is the prior and the target is the posterior, is Bayesian inference. Here, we can tractably calculate the normalization constant and draw posterior i.i.d. samples. Remarkably, our Bayesian tractability criterion is simply log concavity of the prior and likelihood: the same criterion for tractable calculation of the maximum a posteriori point estimate. With simulated data, we demonstrate how we can attain the Bayes risk in simulations. With physiologic data, we demonstrate improvements over point estimation in intensive care unit outcome prediction and electroencephalography-based sleep staging."}
{"text": "The estimation of probabilities of network edges from the observed adjacency matrix has important applications to predicting missing links and network denoising. It has usually been addressed by estimating the graphon, a function that determines the matrix of edge probabilities, but this is ill-defined without strong assumptions on the network structure. Here we propose a novel computationally efficient method, based on neighborhood smoothing to estimate the expectation of the adjacency matrix directly, without making the structural assumptions that graphon estimation requires. The neighborhood smoothing method requires little tuning, has a competitive mean-squared error rate, and outperforms many benchmark methods on link prediction in simulated and real networks."}
{"text": "A latent space model for a family of random graphs assigns real-valued vectors to nodes of the graph such that edge probabilities are determined by latent positions. Latent space models provide a natural statistical framework for graph visualizing and clustering. A latent space model of particular interest is the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), which can be fit using an efficient spectral method; however, this method is based on a heuristic that can fail, even in simple cases. Here, we consider a closely related latent space model, the Logistic RDPG, which uses a logistic link function to map from latent positions to edge likelihoods. Over this model, we show that asymptotically exact maximum likelihood inference of latent position vectors can be achieved using an efficient spectral method. Our method involves computing top eigenvectors of a normalized adjacency matrix and scaling eigenvectors using a regression step. The novel regression scaling step is an essential part of the proposed method. In simulations, we show that our proposed method is more accurate and more robust than common practices. We also show the effectiveness of our approach over standard real networks of the karate club and political blogs."}
{"text": "Hierarchical learning models, such as mixture models and Bayesian networks, are widely employed for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering analysis. They consist of observable and hidden variables, which represent the given data and their hidden generation process, respectively. It has been pointed out that conventional statistical analysis is not applicable to these models, because redundancy of the latent variable produces singularities in the parameter space. In recent years, a method based on algebraic geometry has allowed us to analyze the accuracy of predicting observable variables when using Bayesian estimation. However, how to analyze latent variables has not been sufficiently studied, even though one of the main issues in unsupervised learning is to determine how accurately the latent variable is estimated. A previous study proposed a method that can be used when the range of the latent variable is redundant compared with the model generating data. The present paper extends that method to the situation in which the latent variables have redundant dimensions. We formulate new error functions and derive their asymptotic forms. Calculation of the error functions is demonstrated in two-layered Bayesian networks."}
{"text": "We consider the \\mnk{classical} problem of a controller activating (or sampling) sequentially from a finite number of $N \\geq 2$ populations, specified by unknown distributions. Over some time horizon, at each time $n = 1, 2, \\ldots$, the controller wishes to select a population to sample, with the goal of sampling from a population that optimizes some \"score\" function of its distribution, e.g., maximizing the expected sum of outcomes or minimizing variability. We define a class of \\textit{Uniformly Fast (UF)} sampling policies and show, under mild regularity conditions, that there is an asymptotic lower bound for the expected total number of sub-optimal population activations. Then, we provide sufficient conditions under which a UCB policy is UF and asymptotically optimal, since it attains this lower bound. Explicit solutions are provided for a number of examples of interest, including general score functionals on unconstrained Pareto distributions (of potentially infinite mean), and uniform distributions of unknown support. Additional results on bandits of Normal distributions are also provided."}
{"text": "We consider sequential decision making problems for binary classification scenario in which the learner takes an active role in repeatedly selecting samples from the action pool and receives the binary label of the selected alternatives. Our problem is motivated by applications where observations are time consuming and/or expensive, resulting in small samples. The goal is to identify the best alternative with the highest response. We use Bayesian logistic regression to predict the response of each alternative. By formulating the problem as a Markov decision process, we develop a knowledge-gradient type policy to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information of labeling each alternative and provide a finite-time analysis on the estimated error. Experiments on benchmark UCI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "In this paper we introduce a novel online time series forecasting model we refer to as the pM-GP filter. We show that our model is equivalent to Gaussian process regression, with the advantage that both online forecasting and online learning of the hyper-parameters have a constant (rather than cubic) time complexity and a constant (rather than squared) memory requirement in the number of observations, without resorting to approximations. Moreover, the proposed model is expressive in that the family of covariance functions of the implied latent process, namely the spectral Matern kernels, have recently been proven to be capable of approximating arbitrarily well any translation-invariant covariance function. The benefit of our approach compared to competing models is demonstrated using experiments on several real-life datasets."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of extracting a low-dimensional, linear latent variable structure from high-dimensional random variables. Specifically, we show that under mild conditions and when this structure manifests itself as a linear space that spans the conditional means, it is possible to consistently recover the structure using only information up to the second moments of these random variables. This finding, specialized to one-parameter exponential families whose variance function is quadratic in their means, allows for the derivation of an explicit estimator of such latent structure. This approach serves as a latent variable model estimator and as a tool for dimension reduction for a high-dimensional matrix of data composed of many related variables. Our theoretical results are verified by simulation studies and an application to genomic data."}
{"text": "In order to identify important variables that are involved in making optimal treatment decision, Lu et al. (2013) proposed a penalized least squared regression framework for a fixed number of predictors, which is robust against the misspecification of the conditional mean model. Two problems arise: (i) in a world of explosively big data, effective methods are needed to handle ultra-high dimensional data set, for example, with the dimension of predictors is of the non-polynomial (NP) order of the sample size; (ii) both the propensity score and conditional mean models need to be estimated from data under NP dimensionality.   In this paper, we propose a two-step estimation procedure for deriving the optimal treatment regime under NP dimensionality. In both steps, penalized regressions are employed with the non-concave penalty function, where the conditional mean model of the response given predictors may be misspecified. The asymptotic properties, such as weak oracle properties, selection consistency and oracle distributions, of the proposed estimators are investigated. In addition, we study the limiting distribution of the estimated value function for the obtained optimal treatment regime. The empirical performance of the proposed estimation method is evaluated by simulations and an application to a depression dataset from the STAR*D study."}
{"text": "We address the problem of detecting changes in multivariate datastreams, and we investigate the intrinsic difficulty that change-detection methods have to face when the data dimension scales. In particular, we consider a general approach where changes are detected by comparing the distribution of the log-likelihood of the datastream over different time windows. Despite the fact that this approach constitutes the frame of several change-detection methods, its effectiveness when data dimension scales has never been investigated, which is indeed the goal of our paper. We show that the magnitude of the change can be naturally measured by the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions, and that the detectability of a change of a given magnitude worsens when the data dimension increases. This problem, which we refer to as \\emph{detectability loss}, is due to the linear relationship between the variance of the log-likelihood and the data dimension. We analytically derive the detectability loss on Gaussian-distributed datastreams, and empirically demonstrate that this problem holds also on real-world datasets and that can be harmful even at low data-dimensions (say, 10)."}
{"text": "Robust Bayesian models are appealing alternatives to standard models, providing protection from data that contains outliers or other departures from the model assumptions. Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches, especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation."}
{"text": "We introduce a multivariate stochastic volatility model for asset returns that imposes no restrictions to the structure of the volatility matrix and treats all its elements as functions of latent stochastic processes. When the number of assets is prohibitively large, we propose a factor multivariate stochastic volatility model in which the variances and correlations of the factors evolve stochastically over time. Inference is achieved via a carefully designed feasible and scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that combines two computationally important ingredients: it utilizes invariant to the prior Metropolis proposal densities for simultaneously updating all latent paths and has quadratic, rather than cubic, computational complexity when evaluating the multivariate normal densities required. We apply our modelling and computational methodology to $571$ stock daily returns of Euro STOXX index for data over a period of $10$ years. MATLAB software for this paper is available at http://www.aueb.gr/users/mtitsias/code/msv.zip."}
{"text": "In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvectors of the modularity matrix and the singular vectors of an uncentered data matrix is developed. Based on this analysis the concept of a modularity component is defined, and its properties are developed. It is shown that modularity component analysis can be used to cluster data similar to how traditional principal component analysis is used except that modularity component analysis does not require data centering."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider the problem of stochastic optimization under a bandit feedback model. We generalize the GP-UCB algorithm [Srinivas and al., 2012] to arbitrary kernels and search spaces. To do so, we use a notion of localized chaining to control the supremum of a Gaussian process, and provide a novel optimization scheme based on the computation of covering numbers. The theoretical bounds we obtain on the cumulative regret are more generic and present the same convergence rates as the GP-UCB algorithm. Finally, the algorithm is shown to be empirically more efficient than its natural competitors on simple and complex input spaces."}
{"text": "Early stopping is a well known approach to reduce the time complexity for performing training and model selection of large scale learning machines. On the other hand, memory/space (rather than time) complexity is the main constraint in many applications, and randomized subsampling techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. In this paper we ask whether early stopping and subsampling ideas can be combined in a fruitful way. We consider the question in a least squares regression setting and propose a form of randomized iterative regularization based on early stopping and subsampling. In this context, we analyze the statistical and computational properties of the proposed method. Theoretical results are complemented and validated by a thorough experimental analysis."}
{"text": "We propose a novel method for multiple clustering that assumes a co-clustering structure (partitions in both rows and columns of the data matrix) in each view. The new method is applicable to high-dimensional data. It is based on a nonparametric Bayesian approach in which the number of views and the number of feature-/subject clusters are inferred in a data-driven manner. We simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and multinomial distributions in each cluster block. This makes our method applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical variables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based on variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed method to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other multiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in computation time. Finally, we apply our method to a depression dataset with no true cluster structure available, from which useful inferences are drawn about possible clustering structures of the data."}
{"text": "We present GLASSES: Global optimisation with Look-Ahead through Stochastic Simulation and Expected-loss Search. The majority of global optimisation approaches in use are myopic, in only considering the impact of the next function value; the non-myopic approaches that do exist are able to consider only a handful of future evaluations. Our novel algorithm, GLASSES, permits the consideration of dozens of evaluations into the future. This is done by approximating the ideal look-ahead loss function, which is expensive to evaluate, by a cheaper alternative in which the future steps of the algorithm are simulated beforehand. An Expectation Propagation algorithm is used to compute the expected value of the loss.We show that the far-horizon planning thus enabled leads to substantive performance gains in empirical tests."}
{"text": "Inventory control with unknown demand distribution is considered, with emphasis placed on the case involving discrete nonperishable items. We focus on an adaptive policy which in every period uses, as much as possible, the optimal newsvendor ordering quantity for the empirical distribution learned up to that period. The policy is assessed using the regret criterion, which measures the price paid for ambiguity on demand distribution over $T$ periods. When there are guarantees on the latter's separation from the critical newsvendor parameter $\\beta=b/(h+b)$, a constant upper bound on regret can be found. Without any prior information on the demand distribution, we show that the regret does not grow faster than the rate $T^{1/2+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. In view of a known lower bound, this is almost the best one could hope for. Simulation studies involving this along with other policies are also conducted."}
{"text": "We present tree- and list- structured density estimation methods for high dimensional binary/categorical data. Our density estimation models are high dimensional analogies to variable bin width histograms. In each leaf of the tree (or list), the density is constant, similar to the flat density within the bin of a histogram. Histograms, however, cannot easily be visualized in higher dimensions, whereas our models can. The accuracy of histograms fades as dimensions increase, whereas our models have priors that help with generalization. Our models are sparse, unlike high-dimensional histograms. We present three generative models, where the first one allows the user to specify the number of desired leaves in the tree within a Bayesian prior. The second model allows the user to specify the desired number of branches within the prior. The third model returns lists (rather than trees) and allows the user to specify the desired number of rules and the length of rules within the prior. Our results indicate that the new approaches yield a better balance between sparsity and accuracy of density estimates than other methods for this task."}
{"text": "Estimating the strength of dependency between two variables is fundamental for exploratory analysis and many other applications in data mining. For example: non-linear dependencies between two continuous variables can be explored with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC); and categorical variables that are dependent to the target class are selected using Gini gain in random forests. Nonetheless, because dependency measures are estimated on finite samples, the interpretability of their quantification and the accuracy when ranking dependencies become challenging. Dependency estimates are not equal to 0 when variables are independent, cannot be compared if computed on different sample size, and they are inflated by chance on variables with more categories. In this paper, we propose a framework to adjust dependency measure estimates on finite samples. Our adjustments, which are simple and applicable to any dependency measure, are helpful in improving interpretability when quantifying dependency and in improving accuracy on the task of ranking dependencies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the interpretability of MIC when used as a proxy for the amount of noise between variables, and to gain accuracy when ranking variables during the splitting procedure in random forests."}
{"text": "We present Blitzkriging, a new approach to fast inference for Gaussian processes, applicable to regression, optimisation and classification. State-of-the-art (stochastic) inference for Gaussian processes on very large datasets scales cubically in the number of 'inducing inputs', variables introduced to factorise the model. Blitzkriging shares state-of-the-art scaling with data, but reduces the scaling in the number of inducing points to approximately linear. Further, in contrast to other methods, Blitzkriging: does not force the data to conform to any particular structure (including grid-like); reduces reliance on error-prone optimisation of inducing point locations; and is able to learn rich (covariance) structure from the data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on real data in regression, time-series prediction and signal-interpolation experiments."}
{"text": "Laplacian Eigenvectors of the graph constructed from a data set are used in many spectral manifold learning algorithms such as diffusion maps and spectral clustering. Given a graph constructed from a random sample of a $d$-dimensional compact submanifold $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, we establish the spectral convergence rate of the graph Laplacian. It implies the consistency of the spectral clustering algorithm via a standard perturbation argument. A simple numerical study indicates the necessity of a denoising step before applying spectral algorithms."}
{"text": "Kernel methods obtain superb performance in terms of accuracy for various machine learning tasks since they can effectively extract nonlinear relations. However, their time complexity can be rather large especially for clustering tasks. In this paper we define a general class of kernels that can be easily approximated by randomization. These kernels appear in various applications, in particular, traditional spectral clustering, landmark-based spectral clustering and landmark-based subspace clustering. We show that for $n$ data points from $K$ clusters with $D$ landmarks, the randomization procedure results in an algorithm of complexity $O(KnD)$. Furthermore, we bound the error between the original clustering scheme and its randomization. To illustrate the power of this framework, we propose a new fast landmark subspace (FLS) clustering algorithm. Experiments over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FLS in accelerating subspace clustering with marginal sacrifice of accuracy."}
{"text": "Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are popular tools for studying network structures. However, many modern applications such as gene network discovery and social interactions analysis often involve high-dimensional noisy data with outliers or heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose the Trimmed Graphical Lasso for robust estimation of sparse GGMs. Our method guards against outliers by an implicit trimming mechanism akin to the popular Least Trimmed Squares method used for linear regression. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of our estimator in the high-dimensional setting. In contrast, existing approaches for robust sparse GGMs estimation lack statistical guarantees. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on simulated and real gene expression data which further demonstrate the value of our approach."}
{"text": "In this paper we study nonconvex penalization using Bernstein functions whose first-order derivatives are completely monotone. The Bernstein function can induce a class of nonconvex penalty functions for high-dimensional sparse estimation problems. We derive a thresholding function based on the Bernstein penalty and discuss some important mathematical properties in sparsity modeling. We show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for regression problems penalized by the Bernstein function. We also consider the application of the Bernstein penalty in classification problems and devise a proximal alternating linearized minimization method. Based on theory of the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality, we conduct convergence analysis of these alternating iteration procedures. We particularly exemplify a family of Bernstein nonconvex penalties based on a generalized Gamma measure and conduct empirical analysis for this family."}
{"text": "Dimensionality reduction methods are very common in the field of high dimensional data analysis. Typically, algorithms for dimensionality reduction are computationally expensive. Therefore, their applications for the analysis of massive amounts of data are impractical. For example, repeated computations due to accumulated data are computationally prohibitive. In this paper, an out-of-sample extension scheme, which is used as a complementary method for dimensionality reduction, is presented. We describe an algorithm which performs an out-of-sample extension to newly-arrived data points. Unlike other extension algorithms such as Nystr\\\"om algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses the intrinsic geometry of the data and properties for dimensionality reduction map. We prove that the error of the proposed algorithm is bounded. Additionally to the out-of-sample extension, the algorithm provides a degree of the abnormality of any newly-arrived data point."}
{"text": "In life sciences, the experts generally use empirical knowledge to recode variables, choose interactions and perform selection by classical approach. The aim of this work is to perform automatic learning algorithm for variables selection which can lead to know if experts can be help in they decision or simply replaced by the machine and improve they knowledge and results. The Lasso method can detect the optimal subset of variables for estimation and prediction under some conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which uses automatically all variables available and all interactions. By a double cross-validation combine with Lasso, we select a best subset of variables and with GLM through a simple cross-validation perform predictions. The algorithm assures the stability and the the consistency of estimators."}
{"text": "Currently, machine learning plays an important role in the lives and individual activities of numerous people. Accordingly, it has become necessary to design machine learning algorithms to ensure that discrimination, biased views, or unfair treatment do not result from decision making or predictions made via machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework for supervised learning, neutralized ERM (NERM) that ensures that any classifiers obtained can be guaranteed to be neutral with respect to a viewpoint hypothesis. More specifically, given a viewpoint hypothesis, NERM works to find a target hypothesis that minimizes the empirical risk while simultaneously identifying a target hypothesis that is neutral to the viewpoint hypothesis. Within the NERM framework, we derive a theoretical bound on empirical and generalization neutrality risks. Furthermore, as a realization of NERM with linear classification, we derive a max-margin algorithm, neutral support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that our neutral SVM shows improved classification performance in real datasets without sacrificing the neutrality guarantee."}
{"text": "We propose a framework to perform streaming covariance selection. Our approach employs regularization constraints where a time-varying sparsity parameter is iteratively estimated via stochastic gradient descent. This allows for the regularization parameter to be efficiently learnt in an online manner. The proposed framework is developed for linear regression models and extended to graphical models via neighbourhood selection. Under mild assumptions, we are able to obtain convergence results in a non-stochastic setting. The capabilities of such an approach are demonstrated using both synthetic data as well as neuroimaging data."}
{"text": "Learning a causal effect from observational data is not straightforward, as this is not possible without further assumptions. If hidden common causes between treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$ cannot be blocked by other measurements, one possibility is to use an instrumental variable. In principle, it is possible under some assumptions to discover whether a variable is structurally instrumental to a target causal effect $X \\rightarrow Y$, but current frameworks are somewhat lacking on how general these assumptions can be. A instrumental variable discovery problem is challenging, as no variable can be tested as an instrument in isolation but only in groups, but different variables might require different conditions to be considered an instrument. Moreover, identification constraints might be hard to detect statistically. In this paper, we give a theoretical characterization of instrumental variable discovery, highlighting identifiability problems and solutions, the need for non-Gaussianity assumptions, and how they fit within existing methods."}
{"text": "Black-box alpha (BB-$\\alpha$) is a new approximate inference method based on the minimization of $\\alpha$-divergences. BB-$\\alpha$ scales to large datasets because it can be implemented using stochastic gradient descent. BB-$\\alpha$ can be applied to complex probabilistic models with little effort since it only requires as input the likelihood function and its gradients. These gradients can be easily obtained using automatic differentiation. By changing the divergence parameter $\\alpha$, the method is able to interpolate between variational Bayes (VB) ($\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$) and an algorithm similar to expectation propagation (EP) ($\\alpha = 1$). Experiments on probit regression and neural network regression and classification problems show that BB-$\\alpha$ with non-standard settings of $\\alpha$, such as $\\alpha = 0.5$, usually produces better predictions than with $\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$ (VB) or $\\alpha = 1$ (EP)."}
{"text": "A method for large scale Gaussian process classification has been recently proposed based on expectation propagation (EP). Such a method allows Gaussian process classifiers to be trained on very large datasets that were out of the reach of previous deployments of EP and has been shown to be competitive with related techniques based on stochastic variational inference. Nevertheless, the memory resources required scale linearly with the dataset size, unlike in variational methods. This is a severe limitation when the number of instances is very large. Here we show that this problem is avoided when stochastic EP is used to train the model."}
{"text": "Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations of Gaussian processes (GPs) and are formally equivalent to neural networks with multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are probabilistic and non-parametric and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to generalise, and provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than alternative deep models. The focus of this paper is scalable approximate Bayesian learning of these networks. The paper develops a novel and efficient extension of probabilistic backpropagation, a state-of-the-art method for training Bayesian neural networks, that can be used to train DGPs. The new method leverages a recently proposed method for scaling Expectation Propagation, called stochastic Expectation Propagation. The method is able to automatically discover useful input warping, expansion or compression, and it is therefore is a flexible form of Bayesian kernel design. We demonstrate the success of the new method for supervised learning on several real-world datasets, showing that it typically outperforms GP regression and is never much worse."}
{"text": "Supervised learning is an active research area, with numerous applications in diverse fields such as data analytics, computer vision, speech and audio processing, and image understanding. In most cases, the loss functions used in machine learning assume symmetric noise models, and seek to estimate the unknown function parameters. However, loss functions such as quantile and quantile Huber generalize the symmetric $\\ell_1$ and Huber losses to the asymmetric setting, for a fixed quantile parameter. In this paper, we propose to jointly infer the quantile parameter and the unknown function parameters, for the asymmetric quantile Huber and quantile losses. We explore various properties of the quantile Huber loss and implement a convexity certificate that can be used to check convexity in the quantile parameter. When the loss if convex with respect to the parameter of the function, we prove that it is biconvex in both the function and the quantile parameters, and propose an algorithm to jointly estimate these. Results with synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically recover the quantile parameter corresponding to the noise and also provide an improved recovery of function parameters. To illustrate the potential of the framework, we extend the gradient boosting machines with quantile losses to automatically estimate the quantile parameter at each iteration."}
{"text": "For regular particle filter algorithm or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, the initial weights are traditionally dependent on the proposed distribution, the posterior distribution at the current timestamp in the sampled sequence, and the target is the posterior distribution of the previous timestamp. This is technically correct, but leads to algorithms which usually have practical issues with degeneracy, where all particles eventually collapse onto a single particle. In this paper, we propose and evaluate using $k$ means clustering to attack and even take advantage of this degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a Stochastic SMC algorithm which initializes the set of $k$ means, providing the initial centers chosen from the collapsed particles. To fight against degeneracy, we adjust the regular SMC weights, mediated by cluster proportions, and then correct them to retain the same expectation as before. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach has better performance than vanilla algorithms."}
{"text": "We compute approximate solutions to L0 regularized linear regression using L1 regularization, also known as the Lasso, as an initialization step. Our algorithm, the Lass-0 (\"Lass-zero\"), uses a computationally efficient stepwise search to determine a locally optimal L0 solution given any L1 regularization solution. We present theoretical results of consistency under orthogonality and appropriate handling of redundant features. Empirically, we use synthetic data to demonstrate that Lass-0 solutions are closer to the true sparse support than L1 regularization models. Additionally, in real-world data Lass-0 finds more parsimonious solutions than L1 regularization while maintaining similar predictive accuracy."}
{"text": "We present a scalable Gaussian process model for identifying and characterizing smooth multidimensional changepoints, and automatically learning changes in expressive covariance structure. We use Random Kitchen Sink features to flexibly define a change surface in combination with expressive spectral mixture kernels to capture the complex statistical structure. Finally, through the use of novel methods for additive non-separable kernels, we can scale the model to large datasets. We demonstrate the model on numerical and real world data, including a large spatio-temporal disease dataset where we identify previously unknown heterogeneous changes in space and time."}
{"text": "We present a convex approach to probabilistic segmentation and modeling of time series data. Our approach builds upon recent advances in multivariate total variation regularization, and seeks to learn a separate set of parameters for the distribution over the observations at each time point, but with an additional penalty that encourages the parameters to remain constant over time. We propose efficient optimization methods for solving the resulting (large) optimization problems, and a two-stage procedure for estimating recurring clusters under such models, based upon kernel density estimation. Finally, we show on a number of real-world segmentation tasks, the resulting methods often perform as well or better than existing latent variable models, while being substantially easier to train."}
{"text": "We present PESMO, a Bayesian method for identifying the Pareto set of multi-objective optimization problems, when the functions are expensive to evaluate. The central idea of PESMO is to choose evaluation points so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the posterior distribution over the Pareto set. Critically, the PESMO multi-objective acquisition function can be decomposed as a sum of objective-specific acquisition functions, which enables the algorithm to be used in \\emph{decoupled} scenarios in which the objectives can be evaluated separately and perhaps with different costs. This decoupling capability also makes it possible to identify difficult objectives that require more evaluations. PESMO also offers gains in efficiency, as its cost scales linearly with the number of objectives, in comparison to the exponential cost of other methods. We compare PESMO with other related methods for multi-objective Bayesian optimization on synthetic and real-world problems. The results show that PESMO produces better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations of the objectives, and that a decoupled evaluation can lead to improvements in performance, particularly when the number of objectives is large."}
{"text": "In clinical and neuroscientific studies, systematic differences between two populations of brain networks are investigated in order to characterize mental diseases or processes. Those networks are usually represented as graphs built from neuroimaging data and studied by means of graph analysis methods. The typical machine learning approach to study these brain graphs creates a classifier and tests its ability to discriminate the two populations. In contrast to this approach, in this work we propose to directly test whether two populations of graphs are different or not, by using the kernel two-sample test (KTST), without creating the intermediate classifier. We claim that, in general, the two approaches provides similar results and that the KTST requires much less computation. Additionally, in the regime of low sample size, we claim that the KTST has lower frequency of Type II error than the classification approach. Besides providing algorithmic considerations to support these claims, we show strong evidence through experiments and one simulation."}
{"text": "In some speaker recognition scenarios we find conversations recorded simultaneously over multiple channels. That is the case of the interviews in the NIST SRE dataset. To take advantage of that, we propose a modification of the PLDA model that considers two different inter-session variability terms. The first term is tied between all the recordings belonging to the same conversation whereas the second is not. Thus, the former mainly intends to capture the variability due to the phonetic content of the conversation while the latter tries to capture the channel variability. In this document, we derive the equations for this model. This model was applied in the paper \"Handling Recordings Acquired Simultaneously over Multiple Channels with PLDA\" published at Interspeech 2013."}
{"text": "We consider convex-concave saddle point problems with a separable structure and non-strongly convex functions. We propose an efficient stochastic block coordinate descent method using adaptive primal-dual updates, which enables flexible parallel optimization for large-scale problems. Our method shares the efficiency and flexibility of block coordinate descent methods with the simplicity of primal-dual methods and utilizing the structure of the separable convex-concave saddle point problem. It is capable of solving a wide range of machine learning applications, including robust principal component analysis, Lasso, and feature selection by group Lasso, etc. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods in all these applications."}
{"text": "In this document we are going to derive the equations needed to implement a Variational Bayes estimation of the parameters of the simplified probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (SPLDA) model. This can be used to adapt SPLDA from one database to another with few development data or to implement the fully Bayesian recipe. Our approach is similar to Bishop's VB PPCA."}
{"text": "Latent variable time-series models are among the most heavily used tools from machine learning and applied statistics. These models have the advantage of learning latent structure both from noisy observations and from the temporal ordering in the data, where it is assumed that meaningful correlation structure exists across time. A few highly-structured models, such as the linear dynamical system with linear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference procedures (e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the general rule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models is intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling focuses on approximate inference procedures for one particular class of models. Here, we extend recent developments in stochastic variational inference to develop a `black-box' approximate inference technique for latent variable models with latent dynamical structure. We propose a structured Gaussian variational approximate posterior that carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman filter-smoother but, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach to approximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent variable generative models. We show that our approach recovers accurate estimates in the case of basic models with closed-form posteriors, and more interestingly performs well in comparison to variational approaches that were designed in a bespoke fashion for specific non-conjugate models."}
{"text": "State-of-the-art speaker recognition relays on models that need a large amount of training data. This models are successful in tasks like NIST SRE because there is sufficient data available. However, in real applications, we usually do not have so much data and, in many cases, the speaker labels are unknown. We present a method to adapt a PLDA model from a domain with a large amount of labeled data to another with unlabeled data. We describe a generative model that produces both sets of data where the unknown labels are modeled like latent variables. We used variational Bayes to estimate the hidden variables. Here, we derive the equations for this model. This model has been used in the papers: \"UNSUPERVISED ADAPTATION OF PLDA BY USING VARIATIONAL BAYES METHODS\" publised at ICASSP 2014, \"Unsupervised Training of PLDA with Variational Bayes\" published at Iberspeech 2014, and \"VARIATIONAL BAYESIAN PLDA FOR SPEAKER DIARIZATION IN THE MGB CHALLENGE\" published at ASRU 2015."}

{"text": "Distance-based hierarchical clustering (HC) methods are widely used in unsupervised data analysis but few authors take account of uncertainty in the distance data. We incorporate a statistical model of the uncertainty through corruption or noise in the pairwise distances and investigate the problem of estimating the HC as unknown parameters from measurements. Specifically, we focus on single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) and study its geometry. We prove that under fairly reasonable conditions on the probability distribution governing measurements, SLHC is equivalent to maximum partial profile likelihood estimation (MPPLE) with some of the information contained in the data ignored. At the same time, we show that direct evaluation of SLHC on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of pairwise distances yields a consistent estimator. Consequently, a full MLE is expected to perform better than SLHC in getting the correct HC results for the ground truth metric."}
{"text": "We derive a statistical model for estimation of a dendrogram from single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) that takes account of uncertainty through noise or corruption in the measurements of separation of data. Our focus is on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this \"dendrogram structure'' is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described. These ideas are illustrated by a simple Monte Carlo simulation that, at least for small data sets, suggests the method outperforms SLHC in the presence of noise."}
{"text": "This paper aims at achieving a \"good\" estimator for the gradient of a function on a high-dimensional space. Often such functions are not sensitive in all coordinates and the gradient of the function is almost sparse. We propose a method for gradient estimation that combines ideas from Spall's Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation with compressive sensing. The aim is to obtain \"good\" estimator without too many function evaluations. Application to estimating gradient outer product matrix as well as standard optimization problems are illustrated via simulations."}
{"text": "We present an information-theoretic framework for solving global black-box optimization problems that also have black-box constraints. Of particular interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the constraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic and real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require balancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of PESC and in the actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality approach and develop partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization."}
{"text": "The understanding of the type of inhibitory interaction plays an important role in drug design. Therefore, researchers are interested to know whether a drug has competitive or non-competitive interaction to particular protein targets.   Method: to analyze the interaction types we propose factorization method Macau which allows us to combine different measurement types into a single tensor together with proteins and compounds. The compounds are characterized by high dimensional 2D ECFP fingerprints. The novelty of the proposed method is that using a specially designed noise injection MCMC sampler it can incorporate high dimensional side information, i.e., millions of unique 2D ECFP compound features, even for large scale datasets of millions of compounds. Without the side information, in this case, the tensor factorization would be practically futile.   Results: using public IC50 and Ki data from ChEMBL we trained a model from where we can identify the latent subspace separating the two measurement types (IC50 and Ki). The results suggest the proposed method can detect the competitive inhibitory activity between compounds and proteins."}
{"text": "Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters."}
{"text": "Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm for hidden Markov models, in a sequential data setting. Given a collapsed hidden Markov Model, we break its long Markov chain into a set of short subchains. We propose a novel sum-product algorithm to update the posteriors of the subchains, taking into account their boundary transitions due to the sequential dependencies. Our experiments on two discrete datasets show that our collapsed algorithm is scalable to very large datasets, memory efficient and significantly more accurate than the existing uncollapsed algorithm."}
{"text": "Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm in the sequential data setting. Our algorithm is applicable to both finite hidden Markov models and hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov models, and to any datasets generated by emission distributions in the exponential family. Our experiment results on two discrete datasets show that our inference is both more efficient and more accurate than its uncollapsed version, stochastic variational inference."}
{"text": "In neuroimaging data analysis, Gaussian graphical models are often used to model statistical dependencies across spatially remote brain regions known as functional connectivity. Typically, data is collected across a cohort of subjects and the scientific objectives consist of estimating population and subject-specific graphical models. A third objective that is often overlooked involves quantifying inter-subject variability and thus identifying regions or sub-networks that demonstrate heterogeneity across subjects. Such information is fundamental in order to thoroughly understand the human connectome. We propose Mixed Neighborhood Selection in order to simultaneously address the three aforementioned objectives. By recasting covariance selection as a neighborhood selection problem we are able to efficiently learn the topology of each node. We introduce an additional mixed effect component to neighborhood selection in order to simultaneously estimate a graphical model for the population of subjects as well as for each individual subject. The proposed method is validated empirically through a series of simulations and applied to resting state data for healthy subjects taken from the ABIDE consortium."}
{"text": "We investigate a class of feature allocation models that generalize the Indian buffet process and are parameterized by Gibbs-type random measures. Two existing classes are contained as special cases: the original two-parameter Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Dirichlet process, and the stable (or three-parameter) Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Pitman--Yor process. Asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs-type partitions, such as power laws holding for the number of latent clusters, translates into analogous characteristics for this class of Gibbs-type feature allocation models. Despite containing several different distinct subclasses, the properties of Gibbs-type partitions allow us to develop a black-box procedure for posterior inference within any subclass of models. Through numerical experiments, we compare and contrast a few of these subclasses and highlight the utility of varying power-law behaviors in the latent features."}
{"text": "Topic models are popular for modeling discrete data (e.g., texts, images, videos, links), and provide an efficient way to discover hidden structures/semantics in massive data. One of the core problems in this field is the posterior inference for individual data instances. This problem is particularly important in streaming environments, but is often intractable. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) for recovering sparse solutions to posterior inference. From detailed elucidation of both theoretical and practical aspects, FW exhibits many interesting properties which are beneficial to topic modeling. We then employ FW to design fast methods, including ML-FW, for learning latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) at large scales. Extensive experiments show that to reach the same predictiveness level, ML-FW can perform tens to thousand times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods for learning LDA from massive/streaming data."}
{"text": "One of the core problems in statistical models is the estimation of a posterior distribution. For topic models, the problem of posterior inference for individual texts is particularly important, especially when dealing with data streams, but is often intractable in the worst case. As a consequence, existing methods for posterior inference are approximate and do not have any guarantee on neither quality nor convergence rate. In this paper, we introduce a provably fast algorithm, namely Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (OPE), for posterior inference in topic models. OPE has more attractive properties than existing inference approaches, including theoretical guarantees on quality and fast rate of convergence to a local maximal/stationary point of the inference problem. The discussions about OPE are very general and hence can be easily employed in a wide range of contexts. Finally, we employ OPE to design three methods for learning Latent Dirichlet Allocation from text streams or large corpora. Extensive experiments demonstrate some superior behaviors of OPE and of our new learning methods."}
{"text": "Recursive partitioning approaches producing tree-like models are a long standing staple of predictive modeling, in the last decade mostly as ``sub-learners'' within state of the art ensemble methods like Boosting and Random Forest. However, a fundamental flaw in the partitioning (or splitting) rule of commonly used tree building methods precludes them from treating different types of variables equally. This most clearly manifests in these methods' inability to properly utilize categorical variables with a large number of categories, which are ubiquitous in the new age of big data. Such variables can often be very informative, but current tree methods essentially leave us a choice of either not using them, or exposing our models to severe overfitting. We propose a conceptual framework to splitting using leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation for selecting the splitting variable, then performing a regular split (in our case, following CART's approach) for the selected variable. The most important consequence of our approach is that categorical variables with many categories can be safely used in tree building and are only chosen if they contribute to predictive power. We demonstrate in extensive simulation and real data analysis that our novel splitting approach significantly improves the performance of both single tree models and ensemble methods that utilize trees. Importantly, we design an algorithm for LOO splitting variable selection which under reasonable assumptions does not increase the overall computational complexity compared to CART for two-class classification. For regression tasks, our approach carries an increased computational burden, replacing a O(log(n)) factor in CART splitting rule search with an O(n) term."}
{"text": "The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a widely used random graph model for networks with communities. Despite the recent burst of interest in recovering communities in the SBM from statistical and computational points of view, there are still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic and computational limits of recovery. In this paper, we consider the SBM in its full generality, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of communities or how they grow with the number of nodes, as well as on the connection probabilities inside or across communities. This generality allows us to move past the artifacts of homogenous SBM, and understand the right parameters (such as the relative densities of communities) that define the various recovery thresholds. We outline the implications of our generalizations via a set of illustrative examples. For instance, $\\log n$ is considered to be the standard lower bound on the cluster size for exact recovery via convex methods, for homogenous SBM. We show that it is possible, in the right circumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the cluster, the denser), to recover very small clusters (up to $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ size), if there are just a few of them (at most polylogarithmic in $n$)."}
{"text": "When learning a hidden Markov model (HMM), sequen- tial observations can often be complemented by real-valued summary response variables generated from the path of hid- den states. Such settings arise in numerous domains, includ- ing many applications in biology, like motif discovery and genome annotation. In this paper, we present a flexible frame- work for jointly modeling both latent sequence features and the functional mapping that relates the summary response variables to the hidden state sequence. The algorithm is com- patible with a rich set of mapping functions. Results show that the availability of additional continuous response vari- ables can simultaneously improve the annotation of the se- quential observations and yield good prediction performance in both synthetic data and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) stand at the forefront of many recent developments in deep learning. Yet a major difficulty with these models is their tendency to overfit, with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers. Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning."}
{"text": "Causal inference deals with identifying which random variables \"cause\" or control other random variables. Recent advances on the topic of causal inference based on tools from statistical estimation and machine learning have resulted in practical algorithms for causal inference. Causal inference has the potential to have significant impact on medical research, prevention and control of diseases, and identifying factors that impact economic changes to name just a few. However, these promising applications for causal inference are often ones that involve sensitive or personal data of users that need to be kept private (e.g., medical records, personal finances, etc). Therefore, there is a need for the development of causal inference methods that preserve data privacy. We study the problem of inferring causality using the current, popular causal inference framework, the additive noise model (ANM) while simultaneously ensuring privacy of the users. Our framework provides differential privacy guarantees for a variety of ANM variants. We run extensive experiments, and demonstrate that our techniques are practical and easy to implement."}
{"text": "We propose a novel classification model for weak signal data, building upon a recent model for Bayesian multi-view learning, Group Factor Analysis (GFA). Instead of assuming all data to come from a single GFA model, we allow latent clusters, each having a different GFA model and producing a different class distribution. We show that sharing information across the clusters, by sharing factors, increases the classification accuracy considerably; the shared factors essentially form a flexible noise model that explains away the part of data not related to classification. Motivation for the setting comes from single-trial functional brain imaging data, having a very low signal-to-noise ratio and a natural multi-view setting, with the different sensors, measurement modalities (EEG, MEG, fMRI) and possible auxiliary information as views. We demonstrate our model on a MEG dataset."}
{"text": "We investigate properties of estimators obtained by minimization of U-processes with the Lasso penalty in high-dimensional settings. Our attention is focused on the ranking problem that is popular in machine learning. It is related to guessing the ordering between objects on the basis of their observed predictors.

We cast the problem in a Bayesian framework and derive approximations to the posterior distributions of single time marginals using variational approximate inference. We then show how the approximation can be extended to a wide class of discrete-state Markov jump pro- cesses by making use of the chemical Langevin equation. Our empirical results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides good approximations for these classes of inverse problems."}

{"text": "Learning in deep models using Bayesian methods has generated significant attention recently. This is largely because of the feasibility of modern Bayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a measure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for large-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient thermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a thermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior distributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion increases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so better use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use of an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the traditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more accurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be desirable in Bayesian deep learning. Extensive experiments on two canonical models and their deep extensions demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves general Bayesian posterior sampling, particularly for deep models."}
{"text": "Effective training of deep neural networks suffers from two main issues. The first is that the parameter spaces of these models exhibit pathological curvature. Recent methods address this problem by using adaptive preconditioning for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These methods improve convergence by adapting to the local geometry of parameter space. A second issue is overfitting, which is typically addressed by early stopping. However, recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian model averaging mitigates this problem. The posterior can be sampled by using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). However, the rapidly changing curvature renders default SGLD methods inefficient. Here, we propose combining adaptive preconditioners with SGLD. In support of this idea, we give theoretical properties on asymptotic convergence and predictive risk. We also provide empirical results for Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Nets, and Convolutional Neural Nets, demonstrating that our preconditioned SGLD method gives state-of-the-art performance on these models."}
{"text": "The histogram method is a powerful non-parametric approach for estimating the probability density function of a continuous variable. But the construction of a histogram, compared to the parametric approaches, demands a large number of observations to capture the underlying density function. Thus it is not suitable for analyzing a sparse data set, a collection of units with a small size of data. In this paper, by employing the probabilistic topic model, we develop a novel Bayesian approach to alleviating the sparsity problem in the conventional histogram estimation. Our method estimates a unit's density function as a mixture of basis histograms, in which the number of bins for each basis, as well as their heights, is determined automatically. The estimation procedure is performed by using the fast and easy-to-implement collapsed Gibbs sampling. We apply the proposed method to synthetic data, showing that it performs well."}
{"text": "We propose a novel class of time-varying nonparanormal graphical models, which allows us to model high dimensional heavy-tailed systems and the evolution of their latent network structures. Under this model, we develop statistical tests for presence of edges both locally at a fixed index value and globally over a range of values. The tests are developed for a high-dimensional regime, are robust to model selection mistakes and do not require commonly assumed minimum signal strength. The testing procedures are based on a high dimensional, debiasing-free moment estimator, which uses a novel kernel smoothed Kendall's tau correlation matrix as an input statistic. The estimator consistently estimates the latent inverse Pearson correlation matrix uniformly in both the index variable and kernel bandwidth. Its rate of convergence is shown to be minimax optimal. Our method is supported by thorough numerical simulations and an application to a neural imaging data set."}
{"text": "Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso, whose distribution can be characterized in an efficient manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism."}
{"text": "In compressed sensing, in order to recover a sparse or nearly sparse vector from possibly noisy measurements, the most popular approach is $\\ell_1$-norm minimization. Upper bounds for the $\\ell_2$- norm of the error between the true and estimated vectors are given in [1] and reviewed in [2], while bounds for the $\\ell_1$-norm are given in [3]. When the unknown vector is not conventionally sparse but is \"group sparse\" instead, a variety of alternatives to the $\\ell_1$-norm have been proposed in the literature, including the group LASSO, sparse group LASSO, and group LASSO with tree structured overlapping groups. However, no error bounds are available for any of these modified objective functions. In the present paper, a unified approach is presented for deriving upper bounds on the error between the true vector and its approximation, based on the notion of decomposable and $\\gamma$-decomposable norms. The bounds presented cover all of the norms mentioned above, and also provide a guideline for choosing norms in future to accommodate alternate forms of sparsity."}
{"text": "We study the fundamental tradeoffs between computational tractability and statistical accuracy for a general family of hypothesis testing problems with combinatorial structures. Based upon an oracle model of computation, which captures the interactions between algorithms and data, we establish a general lower bound that explicitly connects the minimum testing risk under computational budget constraints with the intrinsic probabilistic and combinatorial structures of statistical problems. This lower bound mirrors the classical statistical lower bound by Le Cam (1986) and allows us to quantify the optimal statistical performance achievable given limited computational budgets in a systematic fashion. Under this unified framework, we sharply characterize the statistical-computational phase transition for two testing problems, namely, normal mean detection and sparse principal component detection. For normal mean detection, we consider two combinatorial structures, namely, sparse set and perfect matching. For these problems we identify significant gaps between the optimal statistical accuracy that is achievable under computational tractability constraints and the classical statistical lower bounds. Compared with existing works on computational lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms on Turing machines, and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection, we focus on the oracle computational model, which covers a broad range of popular algorithms, and do not rely on unproven hypotheses. Moreover, our result provides an intuitive and concrete interpretation for the intrinsic computational intractability of high-dimensional statistical problems. One byproduct of our result is a lower bound for a strict generalization of the matrix permanent problem, which is of independent interest."}
{"text": "We introduce a general framework for estimation of inverse covariance, or precision, matrices from heterogeneous populations. The proposed framework uses a Laplacian shrinkage penalty to encourage similarity among estimates from disparate, but related, subpopulations, while allowing for differences among matrices. We propose an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for parameter estimation, as well as its extension for faster computation in high dimensions by thresholding the empirical covariance matrix to identify the joint block diagonal structure in the estimated precision matrices. We establish both variable selection and norm consistency of the proposed estimator for distributions with exponential or polynomial tails. Further, to extend the applicability of the method to the settings with unknown populations structure, we propose a Laplacian penalty based on hierarchical clustering, and discuss conditions under which this data-driven choice results in consistent estimation of precision matrices in heterogenous populations. Extensive numerical studies and applications to gene expression data from subtypes of cancer with distinct clinical outcomes indicate the potential advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches."}
{"text": "The aim of this paper is to provide a new method for learning the relationships between data that have been obtained independently. Unlike existing methods like matching, the proposed technique does not require any contextual information, provided that the dependency between the variables of interest is monotone. It can therefore be easily combined with matching in order to exploit the advantages of both methods. This technique can be described as a mix between quantile matching, and deconvolution. We provide for it a theoretical and an empirical validation."}
{"text": "This paper is about index policies for minimizing (frequentist) regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit model, inspired by a Bayesian view on the problem. Our main contribution is to prove that the Bayes-UCB algorithm, which relies on quantiles of posterior distributions, is asymptotically optimal when the reward distributions belong to a one-dimensional exponential family, for a large class of prior distributions. We also show that the Bayesian literature gives new insight on what kind of exploration rates could be used in frequentist, UCB-type algorithms. Indeed, approximations of the Bayesian optimal solution or the Finite Horizon Gittins indices provide a justification for the kl-UCB+ and kl-UCB-H+ algorithms, whose asymptotic optimality is also established."}
{"text": "In this paper, a novel approach for coding nominal data is proposed. For the given nominal data, a rank in a form of complex number is assigned. The proposed method does not lose any information about the attribute and brings other properties previously unknown. The approach based on these knew properties can been used for classification. The analyzed example shows that classification with the use of coded nominal data or both numerical as well as coded nominal data is more effective than the classification, which uses only numerical data."}
{"text": "For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual's disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual's disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions--the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy."}
{"text": "We present a method of variable selection for the sparse generalized additive model. The method doesn't assume any specific functional form, and can select from a large number of candidates. It takes the form of incremental forward stagewise regression. Given no functional form is assumed, we devised an approach termed roughening to adjust the residuals in the iterations. In simulations, we show the new method is competitive against popular machine learning approaches. We also demonstrate its performance using some real datasets. The method is available as a part of the nlnet package on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=nlnet."}
{"text": "Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is aimed at identifying a linear subspace such that the projected data follows a non-Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel NGCA algorithm based on log-density gradient estimation. Unlike existing methods, the proposed NGCA algorithm identifies the linear subspace by using the eigenvalue decomposition without any iterative procedures, and thus is computationally reasonable. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we prove that the identified subspace converges to the true subspace at the optimal parametric rate. Finally, the practical performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on both artificial and benchmark datasets."}
{"text": "This paper presents a new framework for manifold learning based on a sequence of principal polynomials that capture the possibly nonlinear nature of the data. The proposed Principal Polynomial Analysis (PPA) generalizes PCA by modeling the directions of maximal variance by means of curves, instead of straight lines. Contrarily to previous approaches, PPA reduces to performing simple univariate regressions, which makes it computationally feasible and robust. Moreover, PPA shows a number of interesting analytical properties. First, PPA is a volume-preserving map, which in turn guarantees the existence of the inverse. Second, such an inverse can be obtained in closed form. Invertibility is an important advantage over other learning methods, because it permits to understand the identified features in the input domain where the data has physical meaning. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the performance of dimensionality reduction in sensible (input-domain) units. Volume preservation also allows an easy computation of information theoretic quantities, such as the reduction in multi-information after the transform. Third, the analytical nature of PPA leads to a clear geometrical interpretation of the manifold: it allows the computation of Frenet-Serret frames (local features) and of generalized curvatures at any point of the space. And fourth, the analytical Jacobian allows the computation of the metric induced by the data, thus generalizing the Mahalanobis distance. These properties are demonstrated theoretically and illustrated experimentally. The performance of PPA is evaluated in dimensionality and redundancy reduction, in both synthetic and real datasets from the UCI repository."}
{"text": "Most signal processing problems involve the challenging task of multidimensional probability density function (PDF) estimation. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a family of Rotation-based Iterative Gaussianization (RBIG) transforms. The general framework consists of the sequential application of a univariate marginal Gaussianization transform followed by an orthonormal transform. The proposed procedure looks for differentiable transforms to a known PDF so that the unknown PDF can be estimated at any point of the original domain. In particular, we aim at a zero mean unit covariance Gaussian for convenience. RBIG is formally similar to classical iterative Projection Pursuit (PP) algorithms. However, we show that, unlike in PP methods, the particular class of rotations used has no special qualitative relevance in this context, since looking for interestingness is not a critical issue for PDF estimation. The key difference is that our approach focuses on the univariate part (marginal Gaussianization) of the problem rather than on the multivariate part (rotation). This difference implies that one may select the most convenient rotation suited to each practical application. The differentiability, invertibility and convergence of RBIG are theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Relation to other methods, such as Radial Gaussianization (RG), one-class support vector domain description (SVDD), and deep neural networks (DNN) is also pointed out. The practical performance of RBIG is successfully illustrated in a number of multidimensional problems such as image synthesis, classification, denoising, and multi-information estimation."}
{"text": "Generating user interpretable multi-class predictions in data rich environments with many classes and explanatory covariates is a daunting task. We introduce Diagonal Orthant Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DOLDA), a supervised topic model for multi-class classification that can handle both many classes as well as many covariates. To handle many classes we use the recently proposed Diagonal Orthant (DO) probit model (Johndrow et al., 2013) together with an efficient Horseshoe prior for variable selection/shrinkage (Carvalho et al., 2010). We propose a computationally efficient parallel Gibbs sampler for the new model. An important advantage of DOLDA is that learned topics are directly connected to individual classes without the need for a reference class. We evaluate the model's predictive accuracy on two datasets and demonstrate DOLDA's advantage in interpreting the generated predictions."}
{"text": "Traditionally, practitioners initialize the {\\tt k-means} algorithm with centers chosen uniformly at random. Randomized initialization with uneven weights ({\\tt k-means++}) has recently been used to improve the performance over this strategy in cost and run-time. We consider the k-means problem with semi-supervised information, where some of the data are pre-labeled, and we seek to label the rest according to the minimum cost solution. By extending the {\\tt k-means++} algorithm and analysis to account for the labels, we derive an improved theoretical bound on expected cost and observe improved performance in simulated and real data examples. This analysis provides theoretical justification for a roughly linear semi-supervised clustering algorithm."}
{"text": "Regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), proposed by Friedman (1989), is a widely popular classifier that lacks interpretability and is impractical for high-dimensional data sets. Here, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient classifier called high-dimensional RDA (HDRDA), designed for the small-sample, high-dimensional setting. For HDRDA, we show that each training observation, regardless of class, contributes to the class covariance matrix, resulting in an interpretable estimator that borrows from the pooled sample covariance matrix. Moreover, we show that HDRDA is equivalent to a classifier in a reduced-feature space with dimension approximately equal to the training sample size. As a result, the matrix operations employed by HDRDA are computationally linear in the number of features, making the classifier well-suited for high-dimensional classification in practice. We demonstrate that HDRDA is often superior to several sparse and regularized classifiers in terms of classification accuracy with three artificial and six real high-dimensional data sets. Also, timing comparisons between our HDRDA implementation in the sparsediscrim R package and the standard RDA formulation in the klaR R package demonstrate that as the number of features increases, the computational runtime of HDRDA is drastically smaller than that of RDA."}
{"text": "Hearing Aid (HA) algorithms need to be tuned (\"fitted\") to match the impairment of each specific patient. The lack of a fundamental HA fitting theory is a strong contributing factor to an unsatisfying sound experience for about 20% of hearing aid patients. This paper proposes a probabilistic modeling approach to the design of HA algorithms. The proposed method relies on a generative probabilistic model for the hearing loss problem and provides for automated inference of the corresponding (1) signal processing algorithm, (2) the fitting solution as well as a principled (3) performance evaluation metric. All three tasks are realized as message passing algorithms in a factor graph representation of the generative model, which in principle allows for fast implementation on hearing aid or mobile device hardware. The methods are theoretically worked out and simulated with a custom-built factor graph toolbox for a specific hearing loss model."}
{"text": "The problem of learning a sparse model is conceptually interpreted as the process of identifying active features/samples and then optimizing the model over them. Recently introduced safe screening allows us to identify a part of non-active features/samples. So far, safe screening has been individually studied either for feature screening or for sample screening. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for safely screening features and samples simultaneously by alternatively iterating feature and sample screening steps. A significant advantage of considering them simultaneously rather than individually is that they have a synergy effect in the sense that the results of the previous safe feature screening can be exploited for improving the next safe sample screening performances, and vice-versa. We first theoretically investigate the synergy effect, and then illustrate the practical advantage through intensive numerical experiments for problems with large numbers of features and samples."}
{"text": "We propose a nonparametric statistical test for goodness-of-fit: given a set of samples, the test determines how likely it is that these were generated from a target density function. The measure of goodness-of-fit is a divergence constructed via Stein's method using functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our test statistic is based on an empirical estimate of this divergence, taking the form of a V-statistic in terms of the log gradients of the target density and the kernel. We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure. We apply our test to quantifying convergence of approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, statistical model criticism, and evaluating quality of fit vs model complexity in nonparametric density estimation."}
{"text": "Unsupervised image segmentation aims at clustering the set of pixels of an image into spatially homogeneous regions. We introduce here a class of Bayesian nonparametric models to address this problem. These models are based on a combination of a Potts-like spatial smoothness component and a prior on partitions which is used to control both the number and size of clusters. This class of models is flexible enough to include the standard Potts model and the more recent Potts-Dirichlet Process model \\cite{Orbanz2008}. More importantly, any prior on partitions can be introduced to control the global clustering structure so that it is possible to penalize small or large clusters if necessary. Bayesian computation is carried out using an original generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive in terms of RAND\\ index compared to popular image segmentation methods, such as mean-shift, and recent alternative Bayesian nonparametric models."}
{"text": "We derive a new discrepancy statistic for measuring differences between two probability distributions based on combining Stein's identity with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. We apply our result to test how well a probabilistic model fits a set of observations, and derive a new class of powerful goodness-of-fit tests that are widely applicable for complex and high dimensional distributions, even for those with computationally intractable normalization constants. Both theoretical and empirical properties of our methods are studied thoroughly."}
{"text": "Recently, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods have been proposed for scaling up Monte Carlo computations to large data problems. Whilst these approaches have proven useful in many applications, vanilla SG-MCMC might suffer from poor mixing rates when random variables exhibit strong couplings under the target densities or big scale differences. In this study, we propose a novel SG-MCMC method that takes the local geometry into account by using ideas from Quasi-Newton optimization methods. These second order methods directly approximate the inverse Hessian by using a limited history of samples and their gradients. Our method uses dense approximations of the inverse Hessian while keeping the time and memory complexities linear with the dimension of the problem. We provide a formal theoretical analysis where we show that the proposed method is asymptotically unbiased and consistent with the posterior expectations. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach on both synthetic and real datasets. Our experiments on two challenging applications show that our method achieves fast convergence rates similar to Riemannian approaches while at the same time having low computational requirements similar to diagonal preconditioning approaches."}
{"text": "Extracting the underlying low-dimensional space where high-dimensional signals often reside has long been at the center of numerous algorithms in the signal processing and machine learning literature during the past few decades. At the same time, working with incomplete (partly observed) large scale datasets has recently been commonplace for diverse reasons. This so called {\\it big data era} we are currently living calls for devising online subspace learning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data. Their envisaged objective is to {\\it recursively} estimate the unknown subspace by processing streaming data sequentially, thus reducing computational complexity, while obviating the need for storing the whole dataset in memory. In this paper, an online variational Bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations is presented. To account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace, commonly met in practice, low-rankness is explicitly imposed on the sought subspace data matrix by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning principles. Moreover, sparsity, {\\it simultaneously} to low-rankness, is favored on the subspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian scheme that is adopted. In doing so, the proposed algorithm becomes adept in dealing with applications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse, as, e.g., in sparse dictionary learning problems. As shown, the new subspace tracking scheme outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy, in a variety of experiments conducted on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "The mixture of experts (MoE) model is a popular neural network architecture for nonlinear regression and classification. The class of MoE mean functions is known to be uniformly convergent to any unknown target function, assuming that the target function is from Sobolev space that is sufficiently differentiable and that the domain of estimation is a compact unit hypercube. We provide an alternative result, which shows that the class of MoE mean functions is dense in the class of all continuous functions over arbitrary compact domains of estimation. Our result can be viewed as a universal approximation theorem for MoE models."}
{"text": "In this paper we study predictive pattern mining problems where the goal is to construct a predictive model based on a subset of predictive patterns in the database. Our main contribution is to introduce a novel method called safe pattern pruning (SPP) for a class of predictive pattern mining problems. The SPP method allows us to efficiently find a superset of all the predictive patterns in the database that are needed for the optimal predictive model. The advantage of the SPP method over existing boosting-type method is that the former can find the superset by a single search over the database, while the latter requires multiple searches. The SPP method is inspired by recent development of safe feature screening. In order to extend the idea of safe feature screening into predictive pattern mining, we derive a novel pruning rule called safe pattern pruning (SPP) rule that can be used for searching over the tree defined among patterns in the database. The SPP rule has a property that, if a node corresponding to a pattern in the database is pruned out by the SPP rule, then it is guaranteed that all the patterns corresponding to its descendant nodes are never needed for the optimal predictive model. We apply the SPP method to graph mining and item-set mining problems, and demonstrate its computational advantage."}
{"text": "Discovering statistically significant patterns from databases is an important challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in databases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically significant patterns from databases."}
{"text": "Circular variables arise in a multitude of data-modelling contexts ranging from robotics to the social sciences, but they have been largely overlooked by the machine learning community. This paper partially redresses this imbalance by extending some standard probabilistic modelling tools to the circular domain. First we introduce a new multivariate distribution over circular variables, called the multivariate Generalised von Mises (mGvM) distribution. This distribution can be constructed by restricting and renormalising a general multivariate Gaussian distribution to the unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed multivariate circular distributions are shown to be special cases of this construction. Second, we introduce a new probabilistic model for circular regression, that is inspired by Gaussian Processes, and a method for probabilistic principal component analysis with circular hidden variables. These models can leverage standard modelling tools (e.g. covariance functions and methods for automatic relevance determination). Third, we show that the posterior distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution which enables development of an efficient variational free-energy scheme for performing approximate inference and approximate maximum-likelihood learning."}
{"text": "Datasets are growing not just in size but in complexity, creating a demand for rich models and quantification of uncertainty. Bayesian methods are an excellent fit for this demand, but scaling Bayesian inference is a challenge. In response to this challenge, there has been considerable recent work based on varying assumptions about model structure, underlying computational resources, and the importance of asymptotic correctness. As a result, there is a zoo of ideas with few clear overarching principles.   In this paper, we seek to identify unifying principles, patterns, and intuitions for scaling Bayesian inference. We review existing work on utilizing modern computing resources with both MCMC and variational approximation techniques. From this taxonomy of ideas, we characterize the general principles that have proven successful for designing scalable inference procedures and comment on the path forward."}
{"text": "To the best of our knowledge, there are no general well-founded robust methods for statistical unsupervised learning. Most of the unsupervised methods explicitly or implicitly depend on the kernel covariance operator (kernel CO) or kernel cross-covariance operator (kernel CCO). They are sensitive to contaminated data, even when using bounded positive definite kernels. First, we propose robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and robust kernel crosscovariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we propose influence function of classical kernel canonical correlation analysis (classical kernel CCA). Third, using this influence function, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method based on robust kernel CO and robust kernel CCO, called robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel methods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO. Experiments on synthesized and imaging genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed visualization and robust kernel CCA can be applied effectively to both ideal data and contaminated data. The robust methods show the superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "Sampling with replacement occurs in many settings in machine learning, notably in the bagging ensemble technique and the .632+ validation scheme. The number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample can have an important role in the behaviour of prediction models learned on it. Indeed, there are uncontrived examples where duplicate items have no effect. The purpose of this report is to present the distribution of the number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample clearly and concisely, with a view to enabling other machine learning researchers to understand and control this quantity in existing and future resampling techniques. We describe the key characteristics of this distribution along with the generalisation for the case where items come from distinct categories, as in classification. In both cases we discuss the normal limit, and conduct an empirical investigation to derive a heuristic for when a normal approximation is permissible."}
{"text": "Dynamic topic models (DTMs) are very effective in discovering topics and capturing their evolution trends in time series data. To do posterior inference of DTMs, existing methods are all batch algorithms that scan the full dataset before each update of the model and make inexact variational approximations with mean-field assumptions. Due to a lack of a more scalable inference algorithm, despite the usefulness, DTMs have not captured large topic dynamics.   This paper fills this research void, and presents a fast and parallelizable inference algorithm using Gibbs Sampling with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics that does not make any unwarranted assumptions. We also present a Metropolis-Hastings based $O(1)$ sampler for topic assignments for each word token. In a distributed environment, our algorithm requires very little communication between workers during sampling (almost embarrassingly parallel) and scales up to large-scale applications. We are able to learn the largest Dynamic Topic Model to our knowledge, and learned the dynamics of 1,000 topics from 2.6 million documents in less than half an hour, and our empirical results show that our algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than the baselines but also achieves lower perplexity."}
{"text": "Many machine learning problems can be characterized by mutual contamination models. In these problems, one observes several random samples from different convex combinations of a set of unknown base distributions. It is of interest to decontaminate mutual contamination models, i.e., to recover the base distributions either exactly or up to a permutation. This paper considers the general setting where the base distributions are defined on arbitrary probability spaces. We examine the decontamination problem in two mutual contamination models that describe popular machine learning tasks: recovering the base distributions up to a permutation in a mixed membership model, and recovering the base distributions exactly in a partial label model for classification. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability of both mutual contamination models, algorithms for both problems in the infinite and finite sample cases, and introduce novel proof techniques based on affine geometry."}
{"text": "We propose the segmented iHMM (siHMM), a hierarchical infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that supports a simple, efficient inference scheme. The siHMM is well suited to segmentation problems, where the goal is to identify points at which a time series transitions from one relatively stable regime to a new regime. Conventional iHMMs often struggle with such problems, since they have no mechanism for distinguishing between high- and low-level dynamics. Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs) can do better, but they require much more complex and expensive inference algorithms. The siHMM retains the simplicity and efficiency of the iHMM, but outperforms it on a variety of segmentation problems, achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of a more complicated HHMM."}
{"text": "We introduce a new approach for amortizing inference in directed graphical models by learning heuristic approximations to stochastic inverses, designed specifically for use as proposal distributions in sequential Monte Carlo methods. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning a structured neural network which represents an inverse factorization of the graphical model, resulting in a conditional density estimator that takes as input particular values of the observed random variables, and returns an approximation to the distribution of the latent variables. This recognition model can be learned offline, independent from any particular dataset, prior to performing inference. The output of these networks can be used as automatically-learned high-quality proposal distributions to accelerate sequential Monte Carlo across a diverse range of problem settings."}
{"text": "Consider the problem of sparse clustering, where it is assumed that only a subset of the features are useful for clustering purposes. In the framework of the COSA method of Friedman and Meulman, subsequently improved in the form of the Sparse K-means method of Witten and Tibshirani, a natural and simpler hill-climbing approach is introduced. The new method is shown to be competitive with these two methods and others."}
{"text": "In this paper, we present a framework for fitting multivariate Hawkes processes for large-scale problems both in the number of events in the observed history $n$ and the number of event types $d$ (i.e. dimensions). The proposed Low-Rank Hawkes Process (LRHP) framework introduces a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix that allows to perform the nonparametric learning of the $d^2$ triggering kernels using at most $O(ndr^2)$ operations, where $r$ is the rank of the approximation ($r \\ll d,n$). This comes as a major improvement to the existing state-of-the-art inference algorithms that are in $O(nd^2)$. Furthermore, the low-rank approximation allows LRHP to learn representative patterns of interaction between event types, which may be valuable for the analysis of such complex processes in real world datasets. The efficiency and scalability of our approach is illustrated with numerical experiments on simulated as well as real datasets."}
{"text": "We consider Bayesian optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box objective function, where we also have access to cheaper approximations of the objective. In general, such approximations arise in applications such as reinforcement learning, engineering, and the natural sciences, and are subject to an inherent, unknown bias. This model discrepancy is caused by an inadequate internal model that deviates from reality and can vary over the domain, making the utilization of these approximations a non-trivial task.   We present a novel algorithm that provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of the uncertainties arising from model discrepancies and noisy observations. Its optimization decisions rely on a value of information analysis that extends the Knowledge Gradient factor to the setting of multiple information sources that vary in cost: each sampling decision maximizes the predicted benefit per unit cost.   We conduct an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that the method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques: it finds designs of considerably higher objective value and additionally inflicts less cost in the exploration process."}
{"text": "We apply a wild bootstrap method to the Lancaster three-variable interaction measure in order to detect factorisation of the joint distribution on three variables forming a stationary random process, for which the existing permutation bootstrap method fails. As in the i.i.d. case, the Lancaster test is found to outperform existing tests in cases for which two independent variables individually have a weak influence on a third, but that when considered jointly the influence is strong. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: first, we prove that the Lancaster statistic satisfies the conditions required to estimate the quantiles of the null distribution using the wild bootstrap; second, the manner in which this is proved is novel, simpler than existing methods, and can further be applied to other statistics."}
{"text": "Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian \"signals\" from high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded as a generalization of projection pursuit (PP) and independent component analysis (ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed, seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA approach called least-squares NGCA (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a solution analytically through least-squares estimation of log-density gradients and eigendecomposition. However, since pre-whitening of data is involved in LSNGCA, it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a whitening-free LSNGCA method and experimentally demonstrate its superiority."}
{"text": "We introduce overdispersed black-box variational inference, a method to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator of the gradient in black-box variational inference. Instead of taking samples from the variational distribution, we use importance sampling to take samples from an overdispersed distribution in the same exponential family as the variational approximation. Our approach is general since it can be readily applied to any exponential family distribution, which is the typical choice for the variational approximation. We run experiments on two non-conjugate probabilistic models to show that our method effectively reduces the variance, and the overhead introduced by the computation of the proposal parameters and the importance weights is negligible. We find that our overdispersed importance sampling scheme provides lower variance than black-box variational inference, even when the latter uses twice the number of samples. This results in faster convergence of the black-box inference procedure."}
{"text": "Partition functions of probability distributions are important quantities for model evaluation and comparisons. We present a new method to compute partition functions of complex and multimodal distributions. Such distributions are often sampled using simulated tempering, which augments the target space with an auxiliary inverse temperature variable. Our method exploits the multinomial probability law of the inverse temperatures, and provides estimates of the partition function in terms of a simple quotient of Rao-Blackwellized marginal inverse temperature probability estimates, which are updated while sampling. We show that the method has interesting connections with several alternative popular methods, and offers some significant advantages. In particular, we empirically find that the new method provides more accurate estimates than Annealed Importance Sampling when calculating partition functions of large Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM); moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to track training and validation log-likelihoods during learning of RBMs, at minimal computational cost."}
{"text": "Kernel methods are one of the mainstays of machine learning, but the problem of kernel learning remains challenging, with only a few heuristics and very little theory. This is of particular importance in methods based on estimation of kernel mean embeddings of probability measures. For characteristic kernels, which include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely determines its probability measure, so it can be used to design a powerful statistical testing framework, which includes nonparametric two-sample and independence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaussian process prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely related to recently proposed shrinkage estimators for kernel mean embeddings, while the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various possible applications. Critically for the purposes of kernel learning, our model gives a simple, closed form marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data given the kernel hyperparameters. This marginal pseudolikelihood can either be optimized to inform the hyperparameter choice or fully Bayesian inference can be used."}
{"text": "This note compares two recently published machine learning methods for constructing flexible, but tractable families of variational hidden-variable posteriors. The first method, called \"hierarchical variational models\" enriches the inference model with an extra variable, while the other, called \"auxiliary deep generative models\", enriches the generative model instead. We conclude that the two methods are mathematically equivalent."}
{"text": "Generalised Degrees of Freedom (GDF), as defined by Ye (1998 JASA 93:120-131), represent the sensitivity of model fits to perturbations of the data. As such they can be computed for any statistical model, making it possible, in principle, to derive the number of parameters in machine-learning approaches. Defined originally for normally distributed data only, we here investigate the potential of this approach for Bernoulli-data. GDF-values for models of simulated and real data are compared to model complexity-estimates from cross-validation. Similarly, we computed GDF-based AICc for randomForest, neural networks and boosted regression trees and demonstrated its similarity to cross-validation. GDF-estimates for binary data were unstable and inconsistently sensitive to the number of data points perturbed simultaneously, while at the same time being extremely computer-intensive in their calculation. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation was more robust, based on fewer assumptions and faster to compute. Our findings suggest that the GDF-approach does not readily transfer to Bernoulli data and a wider range of regression approaches."}
{"text": "We develop Square Root Graphical Models (SQR), a novel class of parametric graphical models that provides multivariate generalizations of univariate exponential family distributions. Previous multivariate graphical models [Yang et al. 2015] did not allow positive dependencies for the exponential and Poisson generalizations. However, in many real-world datasets, variables clearly have positive dependencies. For example, the airport delay time in New York---modeled as an exponential distribution---is positively related to the delay time in Boston. With this motivation, we give an example of our model class derived from the univariate exponential distribution that allows for almost arbitrary positive and negative dependencies with only a mild condition on the parameter matrix---a condition akin to the positive definiteness of the Gaussian covariance matrix. Our Poisson generalization allows for both positive and negative dependencies without any constraints on the parameter values. We also develop parameter estimation methods using node-wise regressions with $\\ell_1$ regularization and likelihood approximation methods using sampling. Finally, we demonstrate our exponential generalization on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset of airport delay times."}
{"text": "This paper investigates the phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a signal from the magnitudes of its linear measurements. We develop statistically and computationally efficient algorithms for the situation when the measurements are corrupted by sparse outliers that can take arbitrary values. We propose a novel approach to robustify the gradient descent algorithm by using the sample median as a guide for pruning spurious samples in initialization and local search. Adopting the Poisson loss and the reshaped quadratic loss respectively, we obtain two algorithms termed median-TWF and median-RWF, both of which provably recover the signal from a near-optimal number of measurements when the measurement vectors are composed of i.i.d. Gaussian entries, up to a logarithmic factor, even when a constant fraction of the measurements are adversarially corrupted. We further show that both algorithms are stable in the presence of additional dense bounded noise. Our analysis is accomplished by developing non-trivial concentration results of median-related quantities, which may be of independent interest. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
{"text": "Manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but can be computationally expensive procedures when applied to large data sets or when similarities are expensive to compute. To date, little work has been done to investigate the tradeoff between computational resources and the quality of learned representations. We present both theoretical and experimental explorations of this question. In particular, we consider Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings based on a kernel matrix, and explore how the embeddings behave when this kernel matrix is corrupted by occlusion and noise. Our main theoretical result shows that under modest noise and occlusion assumptions, we can (with high probability) recover a good approximation to the Laplacian eigenmaps embedding based on the uncorrupted kernel matrix. Our results also show how regularization can aid this approximation. Experimentally, we explore the effects of noise and occlusion on Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings of two real-world data sets, one from speech processing and one from neuroscience, as well as a synthetic data set."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of maximizing an unknown function over a compact and convex set using as few observations as possible. We observe that the optimization of the function essentially relies on learning the induced bipartite ranking rule of f. Based on this idea, we relate global optimization to bipartite ranking which allows to address problems with high dimensional input space, as well as cases of functions with weak regularity properties. The paper introduces novel meta-algorithms for global optimization which rely on the choice of any bipartite ranking method. Theoretical properties are provided as well as convergence guarantees and equivalences between various optimization methods are obtained as a by-product. Eventually, numerical evidence is given to show that the main algorithm of the paper which adapts empirically to the underlying ranking structure essentially outperforms existing state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms in typical benchmarks."}
{"text": "Linear autoregressive models serve as basic representations of discrete time stochastic processes. Different attempts have been made to provide non-linear versions of the basic autoregressive process, including different versions based on kernel methods. Motivated by the powerful framework of Hilbert space embeddings of distributions, in this paper we apply this methodology for the kernel embedding of an autoregressive process of order $p$. By doing so, we provide a non-linear version of an autoregressive process, that shows increased performance over the linear model in highly complex time series. We use the method proposed for one-step ahead forecasting of different time-series, and compare its performance against other non-linear methods."}
{"text": "The Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm has achieved notable success in training energy-based models including Restricted Boltzmann Machines and played a key role in the emergence of deep learning. The idea of this algorithm is to approximate the intractable term in the exact gradient of the log-likelihood function by using short Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs. The approximate gradient is computationally-cheap but biased. Whether and why the CD algorithm provides an asymptotically consistent estimate are still open questions. This paper studies the asymptotic properties of the CD algorithm in canonical exponential families, which are special cases of the energy-based model. Suppose the CD algorithm runs $m$ MCMC transition steps at each iteration $t$ and iteratively generates a sequence of parameter estimates $\\{\\theta_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ given an i.i.d. data sample $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\sim p_{\\theta_\\star}$. Under conditions which are commonly obeyed by the CD algorithm in practice, we prove the existence of some bounded $m$ such that any limit point of the time average $\\left. \\sum_{s=0}^{t-1} \\theta_s \\right/ t$ as $t \\to \\infty$ is a consistent estimate for the true parameter $\\theta_\\star$. Our proof is based on the fact that $\\{\\theta_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a homogenous Markov chain conditional on the data sample $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n$. This chain meets the Foster-Lyapunov drift criterion and converges to a random walk around the Maximum Likelihood Estimate. The range of the random walk shrinks to zero at rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt[3]{n})$ as the sample size $n \\to \\infty$."}
{"text": "Many real world graphs, such as the graphs of molecules, exhibit structure at multiple different scales, but most existing kernels between graphs are either purely local or purely global in character. In contrast, by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel), which has the property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two graphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels to subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible, we also introduce a randomized projection procedure, similar to the Nystr\\\"om method, but for RKHS operators."}
{"text": "We propose a general modeling and inference framework that composes probabilistic graphical models with deep learning methods and combines their respective strengths. Our model family augments graphical structure in latent variables with neural network observation models. For inference, we extend variational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributions with recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components of these models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving a scalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, natural gradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick. We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application to mouse behavioral phenotyping."}
{"text": "If a document is about travel, we may expect that short snippets of the document should also be about travel. We introduce a general framework for incorporating these types of invariances into a discriminative classifier. The framework imagines data as being drawn from a slice of a Levy process. If we slice the Levy process at an earlier point in time, we obtain additional pseudo-examples, which can be used to train the classifier. We show that this scheme has two desirable properties: it preserves the Bayes decision boundary, and it is equivalent to fitting a generative model in the limit where we rewind time back to 0. Our construction captures popular schemes such as Gaussian feature noising and dropout training, as well as admitting new generalizations."}
{"text": "We propose a new class of metrics on sets, vectors, and functions that can be used in various stages of data mining, including exploratory data analysis, learning, and result interpretation. These new distance functions unify and generalize some of the popular metrics, such as the Jaccard and bag distances on sets, Manhattan distance on vector spaces, and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance on integrable functions. We prove that the new metrics are complete and show useful relationships with $f$-divergences for probability distributions. To further extend our approach to structured objects such as concept hierarchies and ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution. We conduct empirical investigation to demonstrate intuitive interpretation of the new metrics and their effectiveness on real-valued, high-dimensional, and structured data. Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the new metrics outperformed multiple similarity and dissimilarity functions traditionally used in data mining, including the Minkowski family, the fractional $L^p$ family, two $f$-divergences, cosine distance, and two correlation coefficients. Finally, we argue that the new class of metrics is particularly appropriate for rapid processing of high-dimensional and structured data in distance-based learning."}
{"text": "Patent lawsuits are costly and time-consuming. An ability to forecast a patent litigation and time to litigation allows companies to better allocate budget and time in managing their patent portfolios. We develop predictive models for estimating the likelihood of litigation for patents and the expected time to litigation based on both textual and non-textual features. Our work focuses on improving the state-of-the-art by relying on a different set of features and employing more sophisticated algorithms with more realistic data. The rate of patent litigations is very low, which consequently makes the problem difficult. The initial model for predicting the likelihood is further modified to capture a time-to-litigation perspective."}
{"text": "How does one objectively measure the performance of an individual offensive lineman in the NFL? The existing literature proposes various measures that rely on subjective assessments of game film, but has yet to develop an objective methodology to evaluate performance. Using a variety of statistics related to an offensive lineman's performance, we develop a framework to objectively analyze the overall performance of an individual offensive lineman and determine specific linemen who are overvalued or undervalued relative to their salary. We identify eight players across the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 NFL seasons that are considered to be overvalued or undervalued and corroborate the results with existing metrics that are based on subjective evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, the techniques set forth in this work have not been utilized in previous works to evaluate the performance of NFL players at any position, including offensive linemen."}
{"text": "Investigations have been performed into using clustering methods in data mining time-series data from smart meters. The problem is to identify patterns and trends in energy usage profiles of commercial and industrial customers over 24-hour periods, and group similar profiles. We tested our method on energy usage data provided by several U.S. power utilities. The results show accurate grouping of accounts similar in their energy usage patterns, and potential for the method to be utilized in energy efficiency programs."}
{"text": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are among the most played digital games in the world. In these games, teams of players fight against each other in arena environments, and the gameplay is focused on tactical combat. Mastering MOBAs requires extensive practice, as is exemplified in the popular MOBA Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2). In this paper, we present three data-driven measures of spatio-temporal behavior in DotA 2: 1) Zone changes; 2) Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via a fuzzy approach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. We investigate how behavior varies across these measures as a function of the skill level of teams, using four tiers from novice to professional players. Results indicate that spatio-temporal behavior of MOBA teams is related to team skill, with professional teams having smaller within-team distances and conducting more zone changes than amateur teams. The temporal distribution of the within-team distances of professional and high-skilled teams also generally follows patterns distinct from lower skill ranks."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of change-point detection in multivariate time-series. The multivariate distribution of the observations is supposed to follow a graphical model, whose graph and parameters are affected by abrupt changes throughout time. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform exact Bayesian inference whenever one considers a simple class of undirected graphs called spanning trees as possible structures. We are then able to integrate on the graph and segmentation spaces at the same time by combining classical dynamic programming with algebraic results pertaining to spanning trees. In particular, we show that quantities such as posterior distributions for change-points or posterior edge probabilities over time can efficiently be obtained. We illustrate our results on both synthetic and experimental data arising from biology and neuroscience."}
{"text": "In this paper, we present a unified analysis of matrix completion under general low-dimensional structural constraints induced by {\\em any} norm regularization. We consider two estimators for the general problem of structured matrix completion, and provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and the estimation error. Our analysis relies on results from generic chaining, and we establish two intermediate results of independent interest: (a) in characterizing the size or complexity of low dimensional subsets in high dimensional ambient space, a certain partial complexity measure encountered in the analysis of matrix completion problems is characterized in terms of a well understood complexity measure of Gaussian widths, and (b) it is shown that a form of restricted strong convexity holds for matrix completion problems under general norm regularization. Further, we provide several non-trivial examples of structures included in our framework, notably the recently proposed spectral $k$-support norm."}
{"text": "Quantitatively assessing relationships between latent variables and observed variables is important for understanding and developing generative models and representation learning. In this paper, we propose latent-observed dissimilarity (LOD) to evaluate the dissimilarity between the probabilistic characteristics of latent and observed variables. We also define four essential types of generative models with different independence/conditional independence configurations. Experiments using tractable real-world data show that LOD can effectively capture the differences between models and reflect the capability for higher layer learning. They also show that the conditional independence of latent variables given observed variables contributes to improving the transmission of information and characteristics from lower layers to higher layers."}
{"text": "Extremes play a special role in Anomaly Detection. Beyond inference and simulation purposes, probabilistic tools borrowed from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), such as the angular measure, can also be used to design novel statistical learning methods for Anomaly Detection/ranking. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on multivariate EVT to learn how to rank observations in a high dimensional space with respect to their degree of 'abnormality'. The procedure relies on an original dimension-reduction technique in the extreme domain that possibly produces a sparse representation of multivariate extremes and allows to gain insight into the dependence structure thereof, escaping the curse of dimensionality. The representation output by the unsupervised methodology we propose here can be combined with any Anomaly Detection technique tailored to non-extreme data. As it performs linearly with the dimension and almost linearly in the data (in O(dn log n)), it fits to large scale problems. The approach in this paper is novel in that EVT has never been used in its multivariate version in the field of Anomaly Detection. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach."}
{"text": "Many retailers today employ inventory management systems based on Re-Order Point Policies, most of which rely on the assumption that all decreases in product inventory levels result from product sales. Unfortunately, it usually happens that small but random quantities of the product get lost, stolen or broken without record as time passes, e.g., as a consequence of shoplifting. This is usual for retailers handling large varieties of inexpensive products, e.g., grocery stores. In turn, over time these discrepancies lead to stock freezing problems, i.e., situations where the system believes the stock is above the re-order point but the actual stock is at zero, and so no replenishments or sales occur. Motivated by these issues, we model the interaction between sales, losses, replenishments and inventory levels as a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where the inventory levels are unobserved (i.e., hidden) variables we wish to estimate. We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the sale and loss distributions, which relies on solving a one-dimensional dynamic program for the E-step and on solving two separate one-dimensional nonlinear programs for the M-step."}
{"text": "Nonparametric detection of existence of an anomalous structure over a network is investigated. Nodes corresponding to the anomalous structure (if one exists) receive samples generated by a distribution q, which is different from a distribution p generating samples for other nodes. If an anomalous structure does not exist, all nodes receive samples generated by p. It is assumed that the distributions p and q are arbitrary and unknown. The goal is to design statistically consistent tests with probability of errors converging to zero as the network size becomes asymptotically large. Kernel-based tests are proposed based on maximum mean discrepancy that measures the distance between mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Detection of an anomalous interval over a line network is first studied. Sufficient conditions on minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals are characterized in order to guarantee the proposed test to be consistent. It is also shown that certain necessary conditions must hold to guarantee any test to be universally consistent. Comparison of sufficient and necessary conditions yields that the proposed test is order-level optimal and nearly optimal respectively in terms of minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals. Generalization of the results to other networks is further developed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed tests."}
{"text": "Research on manifold learning within a density ridge estimation framework has shown great potential in recent work for both estimation and de-noising of manifolds, building on the intuitive and well-defined notion of principal curves and surfaces. However, the problem of unwrapping or unfolding manifolds has received relatively little attention within the density ridge approach, despite being an integral part of manifold learning in general. This paper proposes two novel algorithms for unwrapping manifolds based on estimated principal curves and surfaces for one- and multi-dimensional manifolds respectively. The methods of unwrapping are founded in the realization that both principal curves and principal surfaces will have inherent local maxima of the probability density function. Following this observation, coordinate systems that follow the shape of the manifold can be computed by following the integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate on the manifold. Furthermore, since integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate is inherently local, we propose to stitch together local coordinate systems using parallel transport along the manifold. We provide numerical experiments on both real and synthetic data that illustrates clear and intuitive unwrapping results comparable to state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms."}
{"text": "Population migration is valuable information which leads to proper decision in urban-planning strategy, massive investment, and many other fields. For instance, inter-city migration is a posterior evidence to see if the government's constrain of population works, and inter-community immigration might be a prior evidence of real estate price hike. With timely data, it is also impossible to compare which city is more favorable for the people, suppose the cities release different new regulations, we could also compare the customers of different real estate development groups, where they come from, where they probably will go. Unfortunately these data was not available.   In this paper, leveraging the data generated by positioning team in Didi, we propose a novel approach that timely monitoring population migration from community scale to provincial scale. Migration can be detected as soon as in a week. It could be faster, the setting of a week is for statistical purpose. A monitoring system is developed, then applied nation wide in China, some observations derived from the system will be presented in this paper.   This new method of migration perception is origin from the insight that nowadays people mostly moving with their personal Access Point (AP), also known as WiFi hotspot. Assume that the ratio of AP moving to the migration of population is constant, analysis of comparative population migration would be feasible. More exact quantitative research would also be done with few sample research and model regression.   The procedures of processing data includes many steps: eliminating the impact of pseudo-migration AP, for instance pocket WiFi, and second-hand traded router; distinguishing moving of population with moving of companies; identifying shifting of AP by the finger print clusters, etc.."}
{"text": "The estimation of normalizing constants is a fundamental step in probabilistic model comparison. Sequential Monte Carlo methods may be used for this task and have the advantage of being inherently parallelizable. However, the standard choice of using a fixed number of particles at each iteration is suboptimal because some steps will contribute disproportionately to the variance of the estimate. We introduce an adaptive version of the Resample-Move algorithm, in which the particle set is adaptively expanded whenever a better approximation of an intermediate distribution is needed. The algorithm builds on the expression for the optimal number of particles and the corresponding minimum variance found under ideal conditions. Benchmark results on challenging Gaussian Process Classification and Restricted Boltzmann Machine applications show that Adaptive Resample-Move (ARM) estimates the normalizing constant with a smaller variance, using less computational resources, than either Resample-Move with a fixed number of particles or Annealed Importance Sampling. A further advantage over Annealed Importance Sampling is that ARM is easier to tune."}
{"text": "We study the sparse non-negative least squares (S-NNLS) problem. S-NNLS occurs naturally in a wide variety of applications where an unknown, non-negative quantity must be recovered from linear measurements. We present a unified framework for S-NNLS based on a rectified power exponential scale mixture prior on the sparse codes. We show that the proposed framework encompasses a large class of S-NNLS algorithms and provide a computationally efficient inference procedure based on multiplicative update rules. Such update rules are convenient for solving large sets of S-NNLS problems simultaneously, which is required in contexts like sparse non-negative matrix factorization (S-NMF). We provide theoretical justification for the proposed approach by showing that the local minima of the objective function being optimized are sparse and the S-NNLS algorithms presented are guaranteed to converge to a set of stationary points of the objective function. We then extend our framework to S-NMF, showing that our framework leads to many well known S-NMF algorithms under specific choices of prior and providing a guarantee that a popular subclass of the proposed algorithms converges to a set of stationary points of the objective function. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed approaches on synthetic and real-world data."}
{"text": "While the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian ($\\mathcal{MGIG}$) distribution arises naturally in some settings as a distribution over symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, certain key properties of the distribution and effective ways of sampling from the distribution have not been carefully studied. In this paper, we show that the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ is unimodal, and the mode can be obtained by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) equation [7]. Based on the property, we propose an importance sampling method for the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ where the mode of the proposal distribution matches that of the target. The proposed sampling method is more efficient than existing approaches [32, 33], which use proposal distributions that may have the mode far from the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$'s mode. Further, we illustrate that the the posterior distribution in latent factor models, such as probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [25], when marginalized over one latent factor has the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ distribution. The characterization leads to a novel Collapsed Monte Carlo (CMC) inference algorithm for such latent factor models. We illustrate that CMC has a lower log loss or perplexity than MCMC, and needs fewer samples."}
{"text": "In recent years, structured matrix recovery problems have gained considerable attention for its real world applications, such as recommender systems and computer vision. Much of the existing work has focused on matrices with low-rank structure, and limited progress has been made matrices with other types of structure. In this paper we present non-asymptotic analysis for estimation of generally structured matrices via the generalized Dantzig selector under generic sub-Gaussian measurements. We show that the estimation error can always be succinctly expressed in terms of a few geometric measures of suitable sets which only depend on the structure of the underlying true matrix. In addition, we derive the general bounds on these geometric measures for structures characterized by unitarily invariant norms, which is a large family covering most matrix norms of practical interest. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of our theoretical development."}
{"text": "We consider a statistical inverse learning problem, where we observe the image of a function $f$ through a linear operator $A$ at i.i.d. random design points $X_i$, superposed with an additive noise. The distribution of the design points is unknown and can be very general. We analyze simultaneously the direct (estimation of $Af$) and the inverse (estimation of $f$) learning problems. In this general framework, we obtain strong and weak minimax optimal rates of convergence (as the number of observations $n$ grows large) for a large class of spectral regularization methods over regularity classes defined through appropriate source conditions. This improves on or completes previous results obtained in related settings. The optimality of the obtained rates is shown not only in the exponent in $n$ but also in the explicit dependency of the constant factor in the variance of the noise and the radius of the source condition set."}
{"text": "Due to challenging applications such as collaborative filtering, the matrix completion problem has been widely studied in the past few years. Different approaches rely on different structure assumptions on the matrix in hand. Here, we focus on the completion of a (possibly) low-rank matrix with binary entries, the so-called 1-bit matrix completion problem. Our approach relies on tools from machine learning theory: empirical risk minimization and its convex relaxations. We propose an algorithm to compute a variational approximation of the pseudo-posterior. Thanks to the convex relaxation, the corresponding minimization problem is bi-convex, and thus the method behaves well in practice. We also study the performance of this variational approximation through PAC-Bayesian learning bounds. On the contrary to previous works that focused on upper bounds on the estimation error of M with various matrix norms, we are able to derive from this analysis a PAC bound on the prediction error of our algorithm.   We focus essentially on convex relaxation through the hinge loss, for which we present the complete analysis, a complete simulation study and a test on the MovieLens data set. However, we also discuss a variational approximation to deal with the logistic loss."}
{"text": "In this article, we present the elitist particle filter based on evolutionary strategies (EPFES) as an efficient approach for nonlinear system identification. The EPFES is derived from the frequently-employed state-space model, where the relevant information of the nonlinear system is captured by an unknown state vector. Similar to classical particle filtering, the EPFES consists of a set of particles and respective weights which represent different realizations of the latent state vector and their likelihood of being the solution of the optimization problem. As main innovation, the EPFES includes an evolutionary elitist-particle selection which combines long-term information with instantaneous sampling from an approximated continuous posterior distribution. In this article, we propose two advancements of the previously-published elitist-particle selection process. Further, the EPFES is shown to be a generalization of the widely-used Gaussian particle filter and thus evaluated with respect to the latter for two completely different scenarios: First, we consider the so-called univariate nonstationary growth model with time-variant latent state variable, where the evolutionary selection of elitist particles is evaluated for non-recursively calculated particle weights. Second, the problem of nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation is addressed in a simulated scenario with speech as input signal: By using long-term fitness measures, we highlight the efficacy of the well-generalizing EPFES in estimating the nonlinear system even for large search spaces. Finally, we illustrate similarities between the EPFES and evolutionary algorithms to outline future improvements by fusing the achievements of both fields of research."}
{"text": "Time-varying mixture densities occur in many scenarios, for example, the distributions of keywords that appear in publications may evolve from year to year, video frame features associated with multiple targets may evolve in a sequence. Any models that realistically cater to this phenomenon must exhibit two important properties: the underlying mixture densities must have an unknown number of mixtures, and there must be some \"smoothness\" constraints in place for the adjacent mixture densities. The traditional Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) may be suited to the first property, but certainly not the second. This is due to how each random measure in the lower hierarchies is sampled independent of each other and hence does not facilitate any temporal correlations. To overcome such shortcomings, we proposed a new Smoothed Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (sHDP). The key novelty of this model is that we place a temporal constraint amongst the nearby discrete measures $\\{G_j\\}$ in the form of symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence with a fixed bound $B$. Although the constraint we place only involves a single scalar value, it nonetheless allows for flexibility in the corresponding successive measures. Remarkably, it also led us to infer the model within the stick-breaking process where the traditional Beta distribution used in stick-breaking is now replaced by a new constraint calculated from $B$. We present the inference algorithm and elaborate on its solutions. Our experiment using NIPS keywords has shown the desirable effect of the model."}
{"text": "We introduce sparse random projection, an important dimension-reduction tool from machine learning, for the estimation of discrete-choice models with high-dimensional choice sets. Initially, high-dimensional data are compressed into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using random projections. Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclic monotonicity moment inequalities implied by the multinomial choice model; the estimation procedure is semi-parametric and does not require explicit distributional assumptions to be made regarding the random utility errors. The random projection procedure is justified via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma -- the pairwise distances between data points are preserved during data compression, which we exploit to show convergence of our estimator. The estimator works well in simulations and in an application to a supermarket scanner dataset."}
{"text": "We consider a firm that sells products over $T$ periods without knowing the demand function. The firm sequentially sets prices to earn revenue and to learn the underlying demand function simultaneously. A natural heuristic for this problem, commonly used in practice, is greedy iterative least squares (GILS). At each time period, GILS estimates the demand as a linear function of the price by applying least squares to the set of prior prices and realized demands. Then a price that maximizes the revenue, given the estimated demand function, is used for the next time period. The performance is measured by the regret, which is the expected revenue loss from the optimal (oracle) pricing policy when the demand function is known. Recently, den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014) demonstrated that GILS is sub-optimal. They introduced algorithms which integrate forced price dispersion with GILS and achieve asymptotically optimal performance.   In this paper, we consider this dynamic pricing problem in a data-rich environment. In particular, we assume that the firm knows the expected demand under a particular price from historical data, and in each period, before setting the price, the firm has access to extra information (demand covariates) which may be predictive of the demand. We prove that in this setting GILS achieves asymptotically optimal regret of order $\\log(T)$. We also show the following surprising result: in the original dynamic pricing problem of den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014), inclusion of any set of covariates in GILS as potential demand covariates (even though they could carry no information) would make GILS asymptotically optimal. We validate our results via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and real data sets."}
{"text": "We present a methodology for clustering N objects which are described by multivariate time series, i.e. several sequences of real-valued random variables. This clustering methodology leverages copulas which are distributions encoding the dependence structure between several random variables. To take fully into account the dependence information while clustering, we need a distance between copulas. In this work, we compare renowned distances between distributions: the Fisher-Rao geodesic distance, related divergences and optimal transport, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Applications of such methodology can be found in the clustering of financial assets. A tutorial, experiments and implementation for reproducible research can be found at www.datagrapple.com/Tech."}
{"text": "Sparse generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) plays a pivotal role in a large family of high-dimensional statistical models, including sparse Fisher's discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and sufficient dimension reduction. Sparse GEP involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. Most existing methods and theory in the context of specific statistical models that are special cases of the sparse GEP require restrictive structural assumptions on the input matrices. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational framework to solve the sparse GEP. At the first stage, we solve a convex relaxation of the sparse GEP. Taking the solution as an initial value, we then exploit a nonconvex optimization perspective and propose the truncated Rayleigh flow method (Rifle) to estimate the leading generalized eigenvector. We show that Rifle converges linearly to a solution with the optimal statistical rate of convergence for many statistical models. Theoretically, our method significantly improves upon the existing literature by eliminating structural assumptions on the input matrices for both stages. To achieve this, our analysis involves two key ingredients: (i) a new analysis of the gradient based method on nonconvex objective functions, and (ii) a fine-grained characterization of the evolution of sparsity patterns along the solution path. Thorough numerical studies are provided to validate the theoretical results."}
{"text": "The modern data analyst must cope with data encoded in various forms, vectors, matrices, strings, graphs, or more. Consequently, statistical and machine learning models tailored to different data encodings are important. We focus on data encoded as normalized vectors, so that their \"direction\" is more important than their magnitude. Specifically, we consider high-dimensional vectors that lie either on the surface of the unit hypersphere or on the real projective plane. For such data, we briefly review common mathematical models prevalent in machine learning, while also outlining some technical aspects, software, applications, and open mathematical challenges."}
{"text": "Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are probabilistic tools of choice for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables in complex systems. Finding changepoints in the structural evolution of a GGM is therefore essential to detecting anomalies in the underlying system modeled by the GGM. In order to detect structural anomalies in a GGM, we consider the problem of estimating changes in the precision matrix of the corresponding Gaussian distribution. We take a two-step approach to solving this problem:- (i) estimating a background precision matrix using system observations from the past without any anomalies, and (ii) estimating a foreground precision matrix using a sliding temporal window during anomaly monitoring. Our primary contribution is in estimating the foreground precision using a novel contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure. In order to accurately learn only the structural changes to the GGM, we maximize a penalized log-likelihood where the penalty is the $l_1$ norm of difference between the foreground precision being estimated and the already learned background precision. We modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for sparse inverse covariance estimation to perform contrastive estimation of the foreground precision matrix. Our results on simulated GGM data show significant improvement in precision and recall for detecting structural changes to the GGM, compared to a non-contrastive sliding window baseline."}
{"text": "Separating the short jobs from the long is a known technique to improve scheduling performance. In this paper we describe a method we developed for accurately predicting the runtimes classes of the jobs to enable this separation. Our method uses the fact that the runtimes can be represented as a mixture of overlapping Gaussian distributions, in order to train a CART classifier to provide the prediction. The threshold that separates the short jobs from the long jobs is determined during the evaluation of the classifier to maximize prediction accuracy. Our results indicate overall accuracy of 90% for the data set used in our study, with sensitivity and specificity both above 90%."}
{"text": "Distributional (or distribution-valued) data are a new type of data arising from several sources and are considered as realizations of distributional variables. A new set of fuzzy c-means algorithms for data described by distributional variables is proposed.   The algorithms use the $L2$ Wasserstein distance between distributions as dissimilarity measures. Beside the extension of the fuzzy c-means algorithm for distributional data, and considering a decomposition of the squared $L2$ Wasserstein distance, we propose a set of algorithms using different automatic way to compute the weights associated with the variables as well as with their components, globally or cluster-wise. The relevance weights are computed in the clustering process introducing product-to-one constraints.   The relevance weights induce adaptive distances expressing the importance of each variable or of each component in the clustering process, acting also as a variable selection method in clustering. We have tested the proposed algorithms on artificial and real-world data. Results confirm that the proposed methods are able to better take into account the cluster structure of the data with respect to the standard fuzzy c-means, with non-adaptive distances."}
{"text": "Controlled interventions provide the most direct source of information for learning causal effects. In particular, a dose-response curve can be learned by varying the treatment level and observing the corresponding outcomes. However, interventions can be expensive and time-consuming. Observational data, where the treatment is not controlled by a known mechanism, is sometimes available. Under some strong assumptions, observational data allows for the estimation of dose-response curves. Estimating such curves nonparametrically is hard: sample sizes for controlled interventions may be small, while in the observational case a large number of measured confounders may need to be marginalized. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical Gaussian process prior that constructs a distribution over the dose-response curve by learning from observational data, and reshapes the distribution with a nonparametric affine transform learned from controlled interventions. This function composition from different sources is shown to speed-up learning, which we demonstrate with a thorough sensitivity analysis and an application to modeling the effect of therapy on cognitive skills of premature infants."}
{"text": "With the recent popularity of graphical clustering methods, there has been an increased focus on the information between samples. We show how learning cluster structure using edge features naturally and simultaneously determines the most likely number of clusters and addresses data scale issues. These results are particularly useful in instances where (a) there are a large number of clusters and (b) we have some labeled edges. Applications in this domain include image segmentation, community discovery and entity resolution. Our model is an extension of the planted partition model and our solution uses results of correlation clustering, which achieves a partition O(log(n))-close to the log-likelihood of the true clustering."}
{"text": "Biological systems are often modelled at different levels of abstraction depending on the particular aims/resources of a study. Such different models often provide qualitatively concordant predictions over specific parametrisations, but it is generally unclear whether model predictions are quantitatively in agreement, and whether such agreement holds for different parametrisations. Here we present a generally applicable statistical machine learning methodology to automatically reconcile the predictions of different models across abstraction levels. Our approach is based on defining a correction map, a random function which modifies the output of a model in order to match the statistics of the output of a different model of the same system. We use two biological examples to give a proof-of-principle demonstration of the methodology, and discuss its advantages and potential further applications."}
{"text": "We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We prove the existence of an optimal MAPE model and we show the universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization based on the MAPE. We also show that finding the best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression, and we apply this weighting strategy to kernel regression. The behavior of the MAPE kernel regression is illustrated on simulated data."}
{"text": "Multivariate Analysis (MVA) comprises a family of well-known methods for feature extraction that exploit correlations among input variables of the data representation. One important property that is enjoyed by most such methods is uncorrelation among the extracted features. Recently, regularized versions of MVA methods have appeared in the literature, mainly with the goal to gain interpretability of the solution. In these cases, the solutions can no longer be obtained in a closed manner, and it is frequent to recur to the iteration of two steps, one of them being an orthogonal Procrustes problem. This letter shows that the Procrustes solution is not optimal from the perspective of the overall MVA method, and proposes an alternative approach based on the solution of an eigenvalue problem. Our method ensures the preservation of several properties of the original methods, most notably the uncorrelation of the extracted features, as demonstrated theoretically and through a collection of selected experiments."}
{"text": "In this paper we propose a new method to predict the final destination of vehicle trips based on their initial partial trajectories. We first review how we obtained clustering of trajectories that describes user behaviour. Then, we explain how we model main traffic flow patterns by a mixture of 2d Gaussian distributions. This yielded a density based clustering of locations, which produces a data driven grid of similar points within each pattern. We present how this model can be used to predict the final destination of a new trajectory based on their first locations using a two step procedure: We first assign the new trajectory to the clusters it mot likely belongs. Secondly, we use characteristics from trajectories inside these clusters to predict the final destination. Finally, we present experimental results of our methods for classification of trajectories and final destination prediction on datasets of timestamped GPS-Location of taxi trips. We test our methods on two different datasets, to assess the capacity of our method to adapt automatically to different subsets."}
{"text": "A very simple interpretation of matrix completion problem is introduced based on statistical models. Combined with the well-known results from missing data analysis, such interpretation indicates that matrix completion is still a valid and principled estimation procedure even without the missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption, which almost all of the current theoretical studies of matrix completion assume."}
{"text": "Structural equation models (SEMs) have been widely adopted for inference of causal interactions in complex networks. Recent examples include unveiling topologies of hidden causal networks over which processes such as spreading diseases, or rumors propagate. The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from their simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear dependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent to adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which account for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The advocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for nonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put forth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a convex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to proximal-splitting optimization methods. To this end, solvers with complementary merits are developed by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers, and proximal gradient iterations. Experiments conducted on simulated data demonstrate that the novel approach outperforms linear SEMs with respect to edge detection errors. Furthermore, tests on a real gene expression dataset unveil interesting new edges that were not revealed by linear SEMs, which could shed more light on regulatory behavior of human genes."}
{"text": "We present a new method for estimating multivariate, second-order stationary Gaussian Random Field (GRF) models based on the Sparse Precision matrix Selection (SPS) algorithm, proposed by Davanloo et al. (2015) for estimating scalar GRF models. Theoretical convergence rates for the estimated between-response covariance matrix and for the estimated parameters of the underlying spatial correlation function are established. Numerical tests using simulated and real datasets validate our theoretical findings. Data segmentation is used to handle large data sets."}
{"text": "Given two possible treatments, there may exist subgroups who benefit greater from one treatment than the other. This problem is relevant to the field of marketing, where treatments may correspond to different ways of selling a product. It is similarly relevant to the field of public policy, where treatments may correspond to specific government programs. And finally, personalized medicine is a field wholly devoted to understanding which subgroups of individuals will benefit from particular medical treatments. We present a computationally fast tree-based method, ABtree, for treatment effect differentiation. Unlike other methods, ABtree specifically produces decision rules for optimal treatment assignment on a per-individual basis. The treatment choices are selected for maximizing the overall occurrence of a desired binary outcome, conditional on a set of covariates. In this poster, we present the methodology on tree growth and pruning, and show performance results when applied to simulated data as well as real data."}
{"text": "This volume is a collection of contributions from the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Interpretation in Neuroimaging (MLINI) at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015) conference. Modern multivariate statistical methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state detection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysis methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional signals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category of a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental disorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate approaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual imaging measurement in isolation.   We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how questions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is now entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally important that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly evolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, there is an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context of rich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specific paradigms that pinpoint a single function, towards schemes for measuring the interaction with natural and more varied scene are made. The goal of the workshop is to pinpoint the most pressing issues and common challenges across the neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology and machine learning fields, and to sketch future directions and open questions in the light of novel methodology."}
{"text": "Many complex ecosystems, such as those formed by multiple microbial taxa, involve intricate interactions amongst various sub-communities. The most basic relationships are frequently modeled as co-occurrence networks in which the nodes represent the various players in the community and the weighted edges encode levels of interaction. In this setting, the composition of a community may be viewed as a probability distribution on the nodes of the network. This paper develops methods for modeling the organization of such data, as well as their Euclidean counterparts, across spatial scales. Using the notion of diffusion distance, we introduce diffusion Frechet functions and diffusion Frechet vectors associated with probability distributions on Euclidean space and the vertex set of a weighted network, respectively. We prove that these functional statistics are stable with respect to the Wasserstein distance between probability measures, thus yielding robust descriptors of their shapes. We apply the methodology to investigate bacterial communities in the human gut, seeking to characterize divergence from intestinal homeostasis in patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation, a treatment used in CDI patients that has proven to be significantly more effective than traditional treatment with antibiotics. The proposed method proves useful in deriving a biomarker that might help elucidate the mechanisms that drive these processes."}
{"text": "We present a method based on the orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix tri-factorization of the normalized Laplacian matrix for community detection in complex networks. While the exact factorization of a given order may not exist and is NP hard to compute, we obtain an approximate factorization by solving an optimization problem. We establish the connection of the factors obtained through the factorization to a non-negative basis of an invariant subspace of the estimated matrix, drawing parallel with the spectral clustering. Using such factorization for clustering in networks is motivated by analyzing a block-diagonal Laplacian matrix with the blocks representing the connected components of a graph. The method is shown to be consistent for community detection in graphs generated from the stochastic block model and the degree corrected stochastic block model. Simulation results and real data analysis show the effectiveness of these methods under a wide variety of situations, including sparse and highly heterogeneous graphs where the usual spectral clustering is known to fail. Our method also performs better than the state of the art in popular benchmark network datasets, e.g., the political web blogs and the karate club data."}
{"text": "We study the problem of estimating the parameters of a regression model from a set of observations, each consisting of a response and a predictor. The response is assumed to be related to the predictor via a regression model of unknown parameters. Often, in such models the parameters to be estimated are assumed to be constant. Here we consider the more general scenario where the parameters are allowed to evolve over time, a more natural assumption for many applications. We model these dynamics via a linear update equation with additive noise that is often used in a wide range of engineering applications, particularly in the well-known and widely used Kalman filter (where the system state it seeks to estimate maps to the parameter values here). We derive an approximate algorithm to estimate both the mean and the variance of the parameter estimates in an online fashion for a generic regression model. This algorithm turns out to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter. We specialize our algorithm to the multivariate exponential family distribution to obtain a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM). Because the common regression models encountered in practice such as logistic, exponential and multinomial all have observations modeled through an exponential family distribution, our results are used to easily obtain algorithms for online mean and variance parameter estimation for all these regression models in the context of time-dependent parameters. Lastly, we propose to use these algorithms in the contextual multi-armed bandit scenario, where so far model parameters are assumed static and observations univariate and Gaussian or Bernoulli. Both of these restrictions can be relaxed using the algorithms described here, which we combine with Thompson sampling to show the resulting performance on a simulation."}
{"text": "With the rapid growth of crowdsourcing platforms it has become easy and relatively inexpensive to collect a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short time. However due to the lack of control over the quality of the annotators, some abnormal annotators may be affected by position bias which can potentially degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper we introduce a statistical framework to model and detect annotator's position bias in order to control the false discovery rate (FDR) without a prior knowledge on the amount of biased annotators - the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries being not too high, in order to assure that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. The key technical development relies on some new knockoff filters adapted to our problem and new algorithms based on the Inverse Scale Space dynamics whose discretization is potentially suitable for large scale crowdsourcing data analysis. Our studies are supported by experiments with both simulated examples and real-world data. The proposed framework provides us a useful tool for quantitatively studying annotator's abnormal behavior in crowdsourcing data arising from machine learning, sociology, computer vision, multimedia, etc."}
{"text": "Sparse versions of principal component analysis (PCA) have imposed themselves as simple, yet powerful ways of selecting relevant features of high-dimensional data in an unsupervised manner. However, when several sparse principal components are computed, the interpretation of the selected variables is difficult since each axis has its own sparsity pattern and has to be interpreted separately. To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure called globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA) that allows to obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. This allows the practitioner to identify the original variables which are relevant to describe the data. To this end, using Roweis' probabilistic interpretation of PCA and a Gaussian prior on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact computation of the marginal likelihood of a Bayesian PCA model. To avoid the drawbacks of discrete model selection, a simple relaxation of this framework is presented. It allows to find a path of models using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood is then maximized over this path. This approach is illustrated on real and synthetic data sets. In particular, using unlabeled microarray data, GSPPCA infers much more relevant gene subsets than traditional sparse PCA algorithms."}
{"text": "We extend Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to perform posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes. This development allows us to define a Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE), a Bayesian nonparametric version of the variational autoencoder that has a latent representation with stochastic dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the SB-VAE, and a semi-supervised variant, learn highly discriminative latent representations that often outperform the Gaussian VAE's."}
{"text": "We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. Popular methods rely on estimating a penalized maximum likelihood of the precision matrix. However, in these approaches structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term, the penalty can be difficult to adapt for domain-specific knowledge, and the inference is computationally demanding. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function, parametrized by a neural network that maps empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. Applying this framework, we find our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well: identifying relevant edges in both synthetic and real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain performance generally superior to analytical methods."}
{"text": "Kernel-based quadrature rules are becoming important in machine learning and statistics, as they achieve super-$\\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates in numerical integration, and thus provide alternatives to Monte Carlo integration in challenging settings where integrands are expensive to evaluate or where integrands are high dimensional. These rules are based on the assumption that the integrand has a certain degree of smoothness, which is expressed as that the integrand belongs to a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, this assumption can be violated in practice (e.g., when the integrand is a black box function), and no general theory has been established for the convergence of kernel quadratures in such misspecified settings. Our contribution is in proving that kernel quadratures can be consistent even when the integrand does not belong to the assumed RKHS, i.e., when the integrand is less smooth than assumed. Specifically, we derive convergence rates that depend on the (unknown) lesser smoothness of the integrand, where the degree of smoothness is expressed via powers of RKHSs or via Sobolev spaces."}
{"text": "In many applications, it is desirable to extract only the relevant aspects of data. A principled way to do this is the information bottleneck (IB) method, where one seeks a code that maximizes information about a 'relevance' variable, Y, while constraining the information encoded about the original data, X. Unfortunately however, the IB method is computationally demanding when data are high-dimensional and/or non-gaussian. Here we propose an approximate variational scheme for maximizing a lower bound on the IB objective, analogous to variational EM. Using this method, we derive an IB algorithm to recover features that are both relevant and sparse. Finally, we demonstrate how kernelized versions of the algorithm can be used to address a broad range of problems with non-linear relation between X and Y."}
{"text": "We extend the traditional worst-case, minimax analysis of stochastic convex optimization by introducing a localized form of minimax complexity for individual functions. Our main result gives function-specific lower and upper bounds on the number of stochastic subgradient evaluations needed to optimize either the function or its \"hardest local alternative\" to a given numerical precision. The bounds are expressed in terms of a localized and computational analogue of the modulus of continuity that is central to statistical minimax analysis. We show how the computational modulus of continuity can be explicitly calculated in concrete cases, and relates to the curvature of the function at the optimum. We also prove a superefficiency result that demonstrates it is a meaningful benchmark, acting as a computational analogue of the Fisher information in statistical estimation. The nature and practical implications of the results are demonstrated in simulations."}
{"text": "Dictionary learning is a cutting-edge area in imaging processing, that has recently led to state-of-the-art results in many signal processing tasks. The idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a learned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis. Determining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for both precision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionary learning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novel regularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method can simultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionary size. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with the non-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples are presented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"text": "The hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a specified kernel are often estimated from the data via the maximum marginal likelihood. Due to the non-convexity of marginal likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters, the optimization may not converge to the global maxima. A common approach to tackle this issue is to use multiple starting points randomly selected from a specific prior distribution. As a result the choice of prior distribution may play a vital role in the predictability of this approach. However, there exists little research in the literature to study the impact of the prior distributions on the hyperparameter estimation and the performance of GPR. In this paper, we provide the first empirical study on this problem using simulated and real data experiments. We consider different types of priors for the initial values of hyperparameters for some commonly used kernels and investigate the influence of the priors on the predictability of GPR models. The results reveal that, once a kernel is chosen, different priors for the initial hyperparameters have no significant impact on the performance of GPR prediction, despite that the estimates of the hyperparameters are very different to the true values in some cases."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of robustifying high-dimensional structured estimation. Robust techniques are key in real-world applications which often involve outliers and data corruption. We focus on trimmed versions of structurally regularized M-estimators in the high-dimensional setting, including the popular Least Trimmed Squares estimator, as well as analogous estimators for generalized linear models and graphical models, using possibly non-convex loss functions. We present a general analysis of their statistical convergence rates and consistency, and then take a closer look at the trimmed versions of the Lasso and Graphical Lasso estimators as special cases. On the optimization side, we show how to extend algorithms for M-estimators to fit trimmed variants and provide guarantees on their numerical convergence. The generality and competitive performance of high-dimensional trimmed estimators are illustrated numerically on both simulated and real-world genomics data."}
{"text": "We propose a data-driven, coarse-graining formulation in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast to existing techniques which are based on a fine-to-coarse map, we adopt the opposite strategy by prescribing a probabilistic coarse-to-fine map. This corresponds to a directed probabilistic model where the coarse variables play the role of latent generators of the fine scale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the framework proposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy method and is capable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place during the CG process. Furthermore, it can be readily extended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are reflected in the posterior of the model parameters. The latter can be used to produce not only point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions or macroscopic observables, but more importantly, predictive posterior distributions on these quantities. Predictive posterior distributions reflect the confidence of the model as a function of the amount of data and the level of coarse-graining. The issues of model complexity and model selection are seamlessly addressed by employing a hierarchical prior that favors the discovery of sparse solutions, revealing the most prominent features in the coarse-grained model. A flexible and parallelizable Monte Carlo - Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) scheme is proposed for carrying out inference and learning tasks. A comparative assessment of the proposed methodology is presented for a lattice spin system and the SPC/E water model."}
{"text": "Generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) aims at finding latent low-dimensional common structure from multiple views (feature vectors in different domains) of the same entities. Unlike principal component analysis (PCA) that handles a single view, (G)CCA is able to integrate information from different feature spaces. Here we focus on MAX-VAR GCCA, a popular formulation which has recently gained renewed interest in multilingual processing and speech modeling. The classic MAX-VAR GCCA problem can be solved optimally via eigen-decomposition of a matrix that compounds the (whitened) correlation matrices of the views; but this solution has serious scalability issues, and is not directly amenable to incorporating pertinent structural constraints such as non-negativity and sparsity on the canonical components. We posit regularized MAX-VAR GCCA as a non-convex optimization problem and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to handle it. Our algorithm alternates between {\\em inexact} solutions of a regularized least squares subproblem and a manifold-constrained non-convex subproblem, thereby achieving substantial memory and computational savings. An important benefit of our design is that it can easily handle structure-promoting regularization. We show that the algorithm globally converges to a critical point at a sublinear rate, and approaches a global optimal solution at a linear rate when no regularization is considered. Judiciously designed simulations and large-scale word embedding tasks are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "Stochastic variational inference (SVI), the state-of-the-art algorithm for scaling variational inference to large-datasets, is inherently serial. Moreover, it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single processor; this is problematic when the number of parameters is in billions. In this paper, we propose extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), an asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference for mixture models on massive real world datasets. ESVI overcomes the limitations of SVI by requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a subset of the parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESVI by running Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on UMBC-3B, a dataset that has a vocabulary of 3 million and a token size of 3 billion. In our experiments, we found that ESVI not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time, but also achieves a better quality solution. In addition, we propose a strategy to speed up computation and save memory when fitting large number of topics."}
{"text": "Predictive models can be used on high-dimensional brain images for diagnosis of a clinical condition. Spatial regularization through structured sparsity offers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the model while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the solution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total Variation (TV) enforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions from the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and a wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such as TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the functions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to high-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to minimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties but reasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the convergence speed. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing technique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which automatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The generated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed towards any globally desired precision. Our main contributions are: To propose an expression of the duality gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to adapt the smoothing parameter and the convergence speed. We provide a convergence rate, which is an improvement over classical proximal gradient smoothing methods. We demonstrate on both simulated and high-dimensional structural neuroimaging data that CONESTA significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art solvers in regard to convergence speed and precision."}
{"text": "Imaging genetic research has essentially focused on discovering unique and co-association effects, but typically ignoring to identify outliers or atypical objects in genetic as well as non-genetics variables. Identifying significant outliers is an essential and challenging issue for imaging genetics and multiple sources data analysis. Therefore, we need to examine for transcription errors of identified outliers. First, we address the influence function (IF) of kernel mean element, kernel covariance operator, kernel cross-covariance operator, kernel canonical correlation analysis (kernel CCA) and multiple kernel CCA. Second, we propose an IF of multiple kernel CCA, which can be applied for more than two datasets. Third, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations of multiple sources of data based on the IF of kernel CCA and multiple kernel CCA. Finally, the proposed methods are capable of analyzing outliers of subjects usually found in biomedical applications, in which the number of dimension is large. To examine the outliers, we use the stem-and-leaf display. Experiments on both synthesized and imaging genetics data (e.g., SNP, fMRI, and DNA methylation) demonstrate that the proposed visualization can be applied effectively."}
{"text": "In genome-wide interaction studies, to detect gene-gene interactions, most methods are divided into two folds: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based and gene-based methods. Basically, the methods based on the gene are more effective than the methods based on a single SNP. Recent years, while the kernel canonical correlation analysis (Classical kernel CCA) based U statistic (KCCU) has proposed to detect the nonlinear relationship between genes. To estimate the variance in KCCU, they have used resampling based methods which are highly computationally intensive. In addition, classical kernel CCA is not robust to contaminated data. We, therefore, first discuss robust kernel mean element, the robust kernel covariance, and cross-covariance operators. Second, we propose a method based on influence function to estimate the variance of the KCCU. Third, we propose a nonparametric robust KCCU method based on robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. Finally, we investigate the proposed methods to synthesized data and imaging genetic data set. Based on gene ontology and pathway analysis, the synthesized and genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed robust method shows the superior performance of the state-of-the-art methods."}
{"text": "We present a novel k-way high-dimensional graphical model called the Generalized Root Model (GRM) that explicitly models dependencies between variable sets of size k > 2---where k = 2 is the standard pairwise graphical model. This model is based on taking the k-th root of the original sufficient statistics of any univariate exponential family with positive sufficient statistics, including the Poisson and exponential distributions. As in the recent work with square root graphical (SQR) models [Inouye et al. 2016]---which was restricted to pairwise dependencies---we give the conditions of the parameters that are needed for normalization using the radial conditionals similar to the pairwise case [Inouye et al. 2016]. In particular, we show that the Poisson GRM has no restrictions on the parameters and the exponential GRM only has a restriction akin to negative definiteness. We develop a simple but general learning algorithm based on L1-regularized node-wise regressions. We also present a general way of numerically approximating the log partition function and associated derivatives of the GRM univariate node conditionals---in contrast to [Inouye et al. 2016], which only provided algorithm for estimating the exponential SQR. To illustrate GRM, we model word counts with a Poisson GRM and show the associated k-sized variable sets. We finish by discussing methods for reducing the parameter space in various situations."}
{"text": "We propose a nonconvex estimator for joint multivariate regression and precision matrix estimation in the high dimensional regime, under sparsity constraints. A gradient descent algorithm with hard thresholding is developed to solve the nonconvex estimator, and it attains a linear rate of convergence to the true regression coefficients and precision matrix simultaneously, up to the statistical error. Compared with existing methods along this line of research, which have little theoretical guarantee, the proposed algorithm not only is computationally much more efficient with provable convergence guarantee, but also attains the optimal finite sample statistical rate up to a logarithmic factor. Thorough experiments on both synthetic and real datasets back up our theory."}
{"text": "We introduce the truncated Gaussian graphical model (TGGM) as a novel framework for designing statistical models for nonlinear learning. A TGGM is a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) with a subset of variables truncated to be nonnegative. The truncated variables are assumed latent and integrated out to induce a marginal model. We show that the variables in the marginal model are non-Gaussian distributed and their expected relations are nonlinear. We use expectation-maximization to break the inference of the nonlinear model into a sequence of TGGM inference problems, each of which is efficiently solved by using the properties and numerical methods of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We use the TGGM to design models for nonlinear regression and classification, with the performances of these models demonstrated on extensive benchmark datasets and compared to state-of-the-art competing results."}
{"text": "Rapid overlay of chemical structures (ROCS) is a standard tool for the calculation of 3D shape and chemical (\"color\") similarity. ROCS uses unweighted sums to combine many aspects of similarity, yielding parameter-free models for virtual screening. In this report, we decompose the ROCS color force field into \"color components\" and \"color atom overlaps\", novel color similarity features that can be weighted in a system-specific manner by machine learning algorithms. In cross-validation experiments, these additional features significantly improve virtual screening performance (ROC AUC scores) relative to standard ROCS."}
{"text": "Clustering is one of the most important unsupervised problems in machine learning and statistics. Among many existing algorithms, kernel k-means has drawn much research attention due to its ability to find non-linear cluster boundaries and its inherent simplicity. There are two main approaches for kernel k-means: SVD of the kernel matrix and convex relaxations. Despite the attention kernel clustering has received both from theoretical and applied quarters, not much is known about robustness of the methods. In this paper we first introduce a semidefinite programming relaxation for the kernel clustering problem, then prove that under a suitable model specification, both the K-SVD and SDP approaches are consistent in the limit, albeit SDP is strongly consistent, i.e. achieves exact recovery, whereas K-SVD is weakly consistent, i.e. the fraction of misclassified nodes vanish."}
{"text": "Monte Carlo (MC) sampling algorithms are an extremely widely-used technique to estimate expectations of functions f(x), especially in high dimensions. Control variates are a very powerful technique to reduce the error of such estimates, but in their conventional form rely on having an accurate approximation of f, a priori. Stacked Monte Carlo (StackMC) is a recently introduced technique designed to overcome this limitation by fitting a control variate to the data samples themselves. Done naively, forming a control variate to the data would result in overfitting, typically worsening the MC algorithm's performance. StackMC uses in-sample / out-sample techniques to remove this overfitting. Crucially, it is a post-processing technique, requiring no additional samples, and can be applied to data generated by any MC estimator. Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that StackMC improved the estimates of expectations when it was used to post-process samples produces by a \"simple sampling\" MC estimator. Here we substantially extend this earlier work. We provide an in-depth analysis of the StackMC algorithm, which we use to construct an improved version of the original algorithm, with lower estimation error. We then perform experiments of StackMC on several additional kinds of MC estimators, demonstrating improved performance when the samples are generated via importance sampling, Latin-hypercube sampling and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. We also show how to extend StackMC to combine multiple fitting functions, and how to apply it to discrete input spaces x."}
{"text": "The vast majority of the neural network literature focuses on predicting point values for a given set of response variables, conditioned on a feature vector. In many cases we need to model the full joint conditional distribution over the response variables rather than simply making point predictions. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to such conditional density estimation (CDE): Multiscale Nets (MSNs) and CDE Trend Filtering. Multiscale nets transform the CDE regression task into a hierarchical classification task by decomposing the density into a series of half-spaces and learning boolean probabilities of each split. CDE Trend Filtering applies a k-th order graph trend filtering penalty to the unnormalized logits of a multinomial classifier network, with each edge in the graph corresponding to a neighboring point on a discretized version of the density. We compare both methods against plain multinomial classifier networks and mixture density networks (MDNs) on a simulated dataset and three real-world datasets. The results suggest the two methods are complementary: MSNs work well in a high-data-per-feature regime and CDE-TF is well suited for few-samples-per-feature scenarios where overfitting is a primary concern."}
{"text": "The multivariate normal density is a monotonic function of the distance to the mean, and its ellipsoidal shape is due to the underlying Euclidean metric. We suggest to replace this metric with a locally adaptive, smoothly changing (Riemannian) metric that favors regions of high local density. The resulting locally adaptive normal distribution (LAND) is a generalization of the normal distribution to the \"manifold\" setting, where data is assumed to lie near a potentially low-dimensional manifold embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^D$. The LAND is parametric, depending only on a mean and a covariance, and is the maximum entropy distribution under the given metric. The underlying metric is, however, non-parametric. We develop a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer the distribution parameters that relies on a combination of gradient descent and Monte Carlo integration. We further extend the LAND to mixture models, and provide the corresponding EM algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of the LAND to fit non-trivial probability distributions over both synthetic data, and EEG measurements of human sleep."}
{"text": "This paper considers the quantification of the prediction performance in Gaussian process regression. The standard approach is to base the prediction error bars on the theoretical predictive variance, which is a lower bound on the mean square-error (MSE). This approach, however, does not take into account that the statistical model is learned from the data. We show that this omission leads to a systematic underestimation of the prediction errors. Starting from a generalization of the Cram\\'er-Rao bound, we derive a more accurate MSE bound which provides a measure of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes. The improved bound is easily computed and we illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples. of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes and illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples."}
{"text": "In this paper we develop a method for learning nonlinear systems with multiple outputs and inputs. We begin by modelling the errors of a nominal predictor of the system using a latent variable framework. Then using the maximum likelihood principle we derive a criterion for learning the model. The resulting optimization problem is tackled using a majorization-minimization approach. Finally, we develop a convex majorization technique and show that it enables a recursive identification method. The method learns parsimonious predictive models and is tested on both synthetic and real nonlinear systems."}
{"text": "We introduce Network Maximal Correlation (NMC) as a multivariate measure of nonlinear association among random variables. NMC is defined via an optimization that infers transformations of variables by maximizing aggregate inner products between transformed variables. For finite discrete and jointly Gaussian random variables, we characterize a solution of the NMC optimization using basis expansion of functions over appropriate basis functions. For finite discrete variables, we propose an algorithm based on alternating conditional expectation to determine NMC. Moreover we propose a distributed algorithm to compute an approximation of NMC for large and dense graphs using graph partitioning. For finite discrete variables, we show that the probability of discrepancy greater than any given level between NMC and NMC computed using empirical distributions decays exponentially fast as the sample size grows. For jointly Gaussian variables, we show that under some conditions the NMC optimization is an instance of the Max-Cut problem. We then illustrate an application of NMC in inference of graphical model for bijective functions of jointly Gaussian variables. Finally, we show NMC's utility in a data application of learning nonlinear dependencies among genes in a cancer dataset."}
{"text": "Good sparse approximations are essential for practical inference in Gaussian Processes as the computational cost of exact methods is prohibitive for large datasets. The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) and the Variational Free Energy (VFE) approximations are two recent popular methods. Despite superficial similarities, these approximations have surprisingly different theoretical properties and behave differently in practice. We thoroughly investigate the two methods for regression both analytically and through illustrative examples, and draw conclusions to guide practical application."}
{"text": "Decoding, ie prediction from brain images or signals, calls for empirical evaluation of its predictive power. Such evaluation is achieved via cross-validation, a method also used to tune decoders' hyper-parameters. This paper is a review on cross-validation procedures for decoding in neuroimaging. It includes a didactic overview of the relevant theoretical considerations. Practical aspects are highlighted with an extensive empirical study of the common decoders in within-and across-subject predictions, on multiple datasets --anatomical and functional MRI and MEG-- and simulations. Theory and experiments outline that the popular \" leave-one-out \" strategy leads to unstable and biased estimates, and a repeated random splits method should be preferred. Experiments outline the large error bars of cross-validation in neuroimaging settings: typical confidence intervals of 10%. Nested cross-validation can tune decoders' parameters while avoiding circularity bias. However we find that it can be more favorable to use sane defaults, in particular for non-sparse decoders."}
{"text": "We introduce the Mondrian kernel, a fast random feature approximation to the Laplace kernel. It is suitable for both batch and online learning, and admits a fast kernel-width-selection procedure as the random features can be re-used efficiently for all kernel widths. The features are constructed by sampling trees via a Mondrian process [Roy and Teh, 2009], and we highlight the connection to Mondrian forests [Lakshminarayanan et al., 2014], where trees are also sampled via a Mondrian process, but fit independently. This link provides a new insight into the relationship between kernel methods and random forests."}
{"text": "Regression trees are becoming increasingly popular as omnibus predicting tools and as the basis of numerous modern statistical learning ensembles. Part of their popularity is their ability to create a regression prediction without ever specifying a structure for the mean model. However, the method implicitly assumes homogeneous variance across the entire explanatory-variable space. It is unknown how the algorithm behaves when faced with heteroscedastic data. In this study, we assess the performance of the most popular regression-tree algorithm in a single-variable setting under a very simple step-function model for heteroscedasticity. We use simulation to show that the locations of splits, and hence the ability to accurately predict means, are both adversely influenced by the change in variance. We identify the pruning algorithm as the main concern, although the effects on the splitting algorithm may be meaningful in some applications."}
{"text": "Tree ensembles, such as random forest and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance, whereas their interpretability is critically limited. In this paper, we propose a post processing method that improves the model interpretability of tree ensembles. After learning a complex tree ensembles in a standard way, we approximate it by a simpler model that is interpretable for human. To obtain the simpler model, we derive the EM algorithm minimizing the KL divergence from the complex ensemble. A synthetic experiment showed that a complicated tree ensemble was approximated reasonably as interpretable."}
{"text": "This paper discusses about an R package that implements the Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been successfully applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction. The clustering part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its implementation with minimum efforts. This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also provides a simple example of usage. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository."}
{"text": "Improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of brain decoding models. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, we present a simple definition for interpretability of linear brain decoding models. Then, we propose to combine the interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our preliminary results on the toy data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative linear models. The presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability in linear brain decoding."}
{"text": "In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a group sparse vector from a small number of linear measurements. In the past the common approach has been to use various \"group sparsity-inducing\" norms such as the Group LASSO norm for this purpose. By using the theory of convex relaxations, we show that it is also possible to use $\\ell_1$-norm minimization for group sparse recovery. We introduce a new concept called group robust null space property (GRNSP), and show that, under suitable conditions, a group version of the restricted isometry property (GRIP) implies the GRNSP, and thus leads to group sparse recovery. When all groups are of equal size, our bounds are less conservative than known bounds. Moreover, our results apply even to situations where where the groups have different sizes. When specialized to conventional sparsity, our bounds reduce to one of the well-known \"best possible\" conditions for sparse recovery. This relationship between GRNSP and GRIP is new even for conventional sparsity, and substantially streamlines the proofs of some known results. Using this relationship, we derive bounds on the $\\ell_p$-norm of the residual error vector for all $p \\in [1,2]$, and not just when $p = 2$. When the measurement matrix consists of random samples of a sub-Gaussian random variable, we present bounds on the number of measurements, which are less conservative than currently known bounds."}
{"text": "We consider training probabilistic classifiers in the case of a large number of classes. The number of classes is assumed too large to perform exact normalisation over all classes. To account for this we consider a simple approach that directly approximates the likelihood. We show that this simple approach works well on toy problems and is competitive with recently introduced alternative non-likelihood based approximations. Furthermore, we relate this approach to a simple ranking objective. This leads us to suggest a specific setting for the optimal threshold in the ranking objective."}
{"text": "We study a two-level multiview learning with more than two views under the PAC-Bayesian framework. This approach, sometimes referred as late fusion, consists in learning sequentially multiple view-specific classifiers at the first level, and then combining these view-specific classifiers at the second level. Our main theoretical result is a generalization bound on the risk of the majority vote which exhibits a term of diversity in the predictions of the view-specific classifiers. From this result it comes out that controlling the trade-off between diversity and accuracy is a key element for multiview learning, which complements other results in multiview learning. Finally, we experiment our principle on multiview datasets extracted from the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collection."}
{"text": "We propose a probabilistic modeling framework for learning the dynamic patterns in the collective behaviors of social agents and developing profiles for different behavioral groups, using data collected from multiple information sources. The proposed model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian process, in which each observation is a finite mixture of an set of latent groups and the mixture proportions (i.e., group probabilities) are drawn randomly. Each group is associated with some distributions over a finite set of outcomes. Moreover, as time evolves, the structure of these groups also changes; we model the change in the group structure by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a fixed transition probability. We present an efficient inference method based on tensor decompositions and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation."}
{"text": "When observations are organized into groups where commonalties exist amongst them, the dependent random measures can be an ideal choice for modeling. One of the propositions of the dependent random measures is that the atoms of the posterior distribution are shared amongst groups, and hence groups can borrow information from each other. When normalized dependent random measures prior with independent increments are applied, we can derive appropriate exchangeable probability partition function (EPPF), and subsequently also deduce its inference algorithm given any mixture model likelihood. We provide all necessary derivation and solution to this framework. For demonstration, we used mixture of Gaussians likelihood in combination with a dependent structure constructed by linear combinations of CRMs. Our experiments show superior performance when using this framework, where the inferred values including the mixing weights and the number of clusters both respond appropriately to the number of completely random measure used."}
{"text": "A novel dynamic Bayesian nonparametric topic model for anomaly detection in video is proposed in this paper. Batch and online Gibbs samplers are developed for inference. The paper introduces a new abnormality measure for decision making. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real data. The comparison with a non-dynamic model shows the superiority of the proposed dynamic one in terms of the classification performance for anomaly detection."}
{"text": "This paper proposes a novel dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process topic model that considers the dependence between successive observations. Conventional posterior inference algorithms for this kind of models require processing of the whole data through several passes. It is computationally intractable for massive or sequential data. We design the batch and online inference algorithms, based on the Gibbs sampling, for the proposed model. It allows to process sequential data, incrementally updating the model by a new observation. The model is applied to abnormal behaviour detection in video sequences. A new abnormality measure is proposed for decision making. The proposed method is compared with the method based on the non- dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, for which we also derive the online Gibbs sampler and the abnormality measure. The results with synthetic and real data show that the consideration of the dynamics in a topic model improves the classification performance for abnormal behaviour detection."}
{"text": "Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a framework for performing likelihood-free posterior inference for simulation models. Stochastic Variational inference (SVI) is an appealing alternative to the inefficient sampling approaches commonly used in ABC. However, SVI is highly sensitive to the variance of the gradient estimators, and this problem is exacerbated by approximating the likelihood. We draw upon recent advances in variance reduction for SV and likelihood-free inference using deterministic simulations to produce low variance gradient estimators of the variational lower-bound. By then exploiting automatic differentiation libraries we can avoid nearly all model-specific derivations. We demonstrate performance on three problems and compare to existing SVI algorithms. Our results demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm."}
{"text": "Deep learning methods such as multitask neural networks have recently been applied to ligand-based virtual screening and other drug discovery applications. Using a set of industrial ADMET datasets, we compare neural networks to standard baseline models and analyze multitask learning effects with both random cross-validation and a more relevant temporal validation scheme. We confirm that multitask learning can provide modest benefits over single-task models and show that smaller datasets tend to benefit more than larger datasets from multitask learning. Additionally, we find that adding massive amounts of side information is not guaranteed to improve performance relative to simpler multitask learning. Our results emphasize that multitask effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the use of dataset-specific models to maximize overall performance."}
{"text": "Contagions such as the spread of popular news stories, or infectious diseases, propagate in cascades over dynamic networks with unobservable topologies. However, \"social signals\" such as product purchase time, or blog entry timestamps are measurable, and implicitly depend on the underlying topology, making it possible to track it over time. Interestingly, network topologies often \"jump\" between discrete states that may account for sudden changes in the observed signals. The present paper advocates a switched dynamic structural equation model to capture the topology-dependent cascade evolution, as well as the discrete states driving the underlying topologies. Conditions under which the proposed switched model is identifiable are established. Leveraging the edge sparsity inherent to social networks, a recursive $\\ell_1$-norm regularized least-squares estimator is put forth to jointly track the states and network topologies. An efficient first-order proximal-gradient algorithm is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Numerical experiments on both synthetic data and real cascades measured over the span of one year are conducted, and test results corroborate the efficacy of the advocated approach."}
{"text": "We consider learning high-dimensional multi-response linear models with structured parameters. By exploiting the noise correlations among responses, we propose an alternating estimation (AltEst) procedure to estimate the model parameters based on the generalized Dantzig selector. Under suitable sample size and resampling assumptions, we show that the error of the estimates generated by AltEst, with high probability, converges linearly to certain minimum achievable level, which can be tersely expressed by a few geometric measures, such as Gaussian width of sets related to the parameter structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-asymptotic statistical guarantee for such AltEst-type algorithm applied to estimation problem with general structures."}
{"text": "Tree ensembles, such as random forests and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance. However, their interpretability is critically limited due to the enormous complexity. In this study, we present a method to make a complex tree ensemble interpretable by simplifying the model. Specifically, we formalize the simplification of tree ensembles as a model selection problem. Given a complex tree ensemble, we aim at obtaining the simplest representation that is essentially equivalent to the original one. To this end, we derive a Bayesian model selection algorithm that optimizes the simplified model while maintaining the prediction performance. Our numerical experiments on several datasets showed that complicated tree ensembles were reasonably approximated as interpretable."}
{"text": "The problem of finding overlapping communities in networks has gained much attention recently. Optimization-based approaches use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or variants, but the global optimum cannot be provably attained in general. Model-based approaches, such as the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel or MMSB (Airoldi et al., 2008), use parameters for each node to specify the overlapping communities, but standard inference techniques cannot guarantee consistency. We link the two approaches, by (a) establishing sufficient conditions for the symmetric NMF optimization to have a unique solution under MMSB, and (b) proposing a computationally efficient algorithm called GeoNMF that is provably optimal and hence consistent for a broad parameter regime. We demonstrate its accuracy on both simulated and real-world datasets."}
{"text": "Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites play an important role in addressing health information needs. However, a significant number of posted questions remain unanswered. Automatically answering the posted questions can provide a useful source of information for online health communities. In this study, we developed an algorithm to automatically answer health-related questions based on past questions and answers (QA). We also aimed to understand information embedded within online health content that are good features in identifying valid answers. Our proposed algorithm uses information retrieval techniques to identify candidate answers from resolved QA. In order to rank these candidates, we implemented a semi-supervised leaning algorithm that extracts the best answer to a question. We assessed this approach on a curated corpus from Yahoo! Answers and compared against a rule-based string similarity baseline. On our dataset, the semi-supervised learning algorithm has an accuracy of 86.2%. UMLS-based (health-related) features used in the model enhance the algorithm's performance by proximately 8 %. A reasonably high rate of accuracy is obtained given that the data is considerably noisy. Important features distinguishing a valid answer from an invalid answer include text length, number of stop words contained in a test question, a distance between the test question and other questions in the corpus as well as a number of overlapping health-related terms between questions. Overall, our automated QA system based on historical QA pairs is shown to be effective according to the data set in this case study. It is developed for general use in the health care domain which can also be applied to other CQA sites."}
{"text": "Probabilistic programming languages represent complex data with intermingled models in a few lines of code. Efficient inference algorithms in probabilistic programming languages make possible to build unified frameworks to compute interesting probabilities of various large, real-world problems. When the structure of model is given, constructing a probabilistic program is rather straightforward. Thus, main focus have been to learn the best model parameters and compute marginal probabilities. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to build expressive probabilistic program from continue time series data when the structure of model is not given. The intuition behind of our method is to find a descriptive covariance structure of time series data in nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We report that such descriptive covariance structure efficiently derives a probabilistic programming description accurately."}
{"text": "Given a graph in which a few vertices are deemed interesting a priori, the vertex nomination task is to order the remaining vertices into a nomination list such that there is a concentration of interesting vertices at the top of the list. Previous work has yielded several approaches to this problem, with theoretical results in the setting where the graph is drawn from a stochastic block model (SBM), including a vertex nomination analogue of the Bayes optimal classifier. In this paper, we prove that maximum likelihood (ML)-based vertex nomination is consistent, in the sense that the performance of the ML-based scheme asymptotically matches that of the Bayes optimal scheme. We prove theorems of this form both when model parameters are known and unknown. Additionally, we introduce and prove consistency of a related, more scalable restricted-focus ML vertex nomination scheme. Finally, we incorporate vertex and edge features into ML-based vertex nomination and briefly explore the empirical effectiveness of this approach."}
{"text": "We propose a Bayesian nonparametric prior for time-varying networks. To each node of the network is associated a positive parameter, modeling the sociability of that node. Sociabilities are assumed to evolve over time, and are modeled via a dynamic point process model. The model is able to (a) capture smooth evolution of the interaction between nodes, allowing edges to appear/disappear over time (b) capture long term evolution of the sociabilities of the nodes (c) and yield sparse graphs, where the number of edges grows subquadratically with the number of nodes. The evolution of the sociabilities is described by a tractable time-varying gamma process. We provide some theoretical insights into the model and apply it to three real world datasets."}
{"text": "We propose a vector-valued regression problem whose solution is equivalent to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding of the Bayesian posterior distribution. This equivalence provides a new understanding of kernel Bayesian inference. Moreover, the optimization problem induces a new regularization for the posterior embedding estimator, which is faster and has comparable performance to the squared regularization in kernel Bayes' rule. This regularization coincides with a former thresholding approach used in kernel POMDPs whose consistency remains to be established. Our theoretical work solves this open problem and provides consistency analysis in regression settings. Based on our optimizational formulation, we propose a flexible Bayesian posterior regularization framework which for the first time enables us to put regularization at the distribution level. We apply this method to nonparametric state-space filtering tasks with extremely nonlinear dynamics and show performance gains over all other baselines."}
{"text": "We present a general framework for classifying partially observed dynamical systems based on the idea of learning in the model space. In contrast to the existing approaches using model point estimates to represent individual data items, we employ posterior distributions over models, thus taking into account in a principled manner the uncertainty due to both the generative (observational and/or dynamic noise) and observation (sampling in time) processes. We evaluate the framework on two testbeds - a biological pathway model and a stochastic double-well system. Crucially, we show that the classifier performance is not impaired when the model class used for inferring posterior distributions is much more simple than the observation-generating model class, provided the reduced complexity inferential model class captures the essential characteristics needed for the given classification task."}
{"text": "Additive nonparametric regression models provide an attractive tool for variable selection in high dimensions when the relationship between the response and predictors is complex. They offer greater flexibility compared to parametric non-linear regression models and better interpretability and scalability than the non-parametric regression models. However, achieving sparsity simultaneously in the number of nonparametric components as well as in the variables within each nonparametric component poses a stiff computational challenge. In this article, we develop a novel Bayesian additive regression model using a combination of hard and soft shrinkages to separately control the number of additive components and the variables within each component. An efficient algorithm is developed to select the importance variables and estimate the interaction network. Excellent performance is obtained in simulated and real data examples."}
{"text": "Ensemble of regression trees have become popular statistical tools for the estimation of conditional mean given a set of predictors. However, quantile regression trees and their ensembles have not yet garnered much attention despite the increasing popularity of the linear quantile regression model. This work proposes a Bayesian quantile additive regression trees model that shows very good predictive performance illustrated using simulation studies and real data applications. Further extension to tackle binary classification problems is also considered."}
{"text": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) exploits Hamiltonian dynamics to construct efficient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we present a generalization of HMC which exploits \\textit{non-canonical} Hamiltonian dynamics. We refer to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dynamics map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field. We establish a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples where these non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary HMC."}
{"text": "We present new methods to estimate causal effects retrospectively from micro data with the assistance of a machine learning ensemble. This approach overcomes two important limitations in conventional methods like regression modeling or matching: (i) ambiguity about the pertinent retrospective counterfactuals and (ii) potential misspecification, overfitting, and otherwise bias-prone or inefficient use of a large identifying covariate set in the estimation of causal effects. Our method targets the analysis toward a well defined ``retrospective intervention effect'' (RIE) based on hypothetical population interventions and applies a machine learning ensemble that allows data to guide us, in a controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set. We illustrate with an analysis of policy options for reducing ex-combatant recidivism in Colombia."}
{"text": "Machine learning is the science of discovering statistical dependencies in data, and the use of those dependencies to perform predictions. During the last decade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human performance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and computer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning avoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way forward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human intelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms.   Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships between the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide understanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen environments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer \"what if\" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under hypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and effect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine intelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in specific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in practice.   This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways. First, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on copulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret the problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification, yielding a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover causal structures in convolutional neural network features using our algorithms. The algorithms presented in this thesis are scalable, exhibit strong theoretical guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of real-world benchmarks."}
{"text": "Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as mixture models, are used for cluster analysis. These models have two types of variables: observable and latent. In cluster analysis, the latent variable is estimated, and it is expected that additional information will improve the accuracy of the estimation of the latent variable. Many proposed learning methods are able to use additional data; these include semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. However, from a statistical point of view, a complex probabilistic model that encompasses both the initial and additional data might be less accurate due to having a higher-dimensional parameter. The present paper presents a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of such a model and clarifies which factor has the greatest effect on its accuracy, the advantages of obtaining additional data, and the disadvantages of increasing the complexity."}
{"text": "We study the density estimation problem with observations generated by certain dynamical systems that admit a unique underlying invariant Lebesgue density. Observations drawn from dynamical systems are not independent and moreover, usual mixing concepts may not be appropriate for measuring the dependence among these observations. By employing the $\\mathcal{C}$-mixing concept to measure the dependence, we conduct statistical analysis on the consistency and convergence of the kernel density estimator. Our main results are as follows: First, we show that with properly chosen bandwidth, the kernel density estimator is universally consistent under $L_1$-norm; Second, we establish convergence rates for the estimator with respect to several classes of dynamical systems under $L_1$-norm. In the analysis, the density function $f$ is only assumed to be H\\\"{o}lder continuous which is a weak assumption in the literature of nonparametric density estimation and also more realistic in the dynamical system context. Last but not least, we prove that the same convergence rates of the estimator under $L_\\infty$-norm and $L_1$-norm can be achieved when the density function is H\\\"{o}lder continuous, compactly supported and bounded. The bandwidth selection problem of the kernel density estimator for dynamical system is also discussed in our study via numerical simulations."}
{"text": "An important problem in sequential decision-making under uncertainty is to use limited data to compute a safe policy, i.e., a policy that is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a given baseline strategy. In this paper, we develop and analyze a new model-based approach to compute a safe policy when we have access to an inaccurate dynamics model of the system with known accuracy guarantees. Our proposed robust method uses this (inaccurate) model to directly minimize the (negative) regret w.r.t. the baseline policy. Contrary to the existing approaches, minimizing the regret allows one to improve the baseline policy in states with accurate dynamics and seamlessly fall back to the baseline policy, otherwise. We show that our formulation is NP-hard and propose an approximate algorithm. Our empirical results on several domains show that even this relatively simple approximate algorithm can significantly outperform standard approaches."}
{"text": "Spectral embedding uses eigenfunctions of the discrete Laplacian on a weighted graph to obtain coordinates for an embedding of an abstract data set into Euclidean space. We propose a new pre-processing step of first using the eigenfunctions to simulate a low-frequency wave moving over the data and using both position as well as change in time of the wave to obtain a refined metric to which classical methods of dimensionality reduction can then applied. This is motivated by the behavior of waves, symmetries of the wave equation and the hunting technique of bats. It is shown to be effective in practice and also works for other partial differential equations -- the method yields improved results even for the classical heat equation."}
{"text": "This work falls within the context of predicting the value of a real function at some input locations given a limited number of observations of this function. The Kriging interpolation technique (or Gaussian process regression) is often considered to tackle such a problem but the method suffers from its computational burden when the number of observation points is large. We introduce in this article nested Kriging predictors which are constructed by aggregating sub-models based on subsets of observation points. This approach is proven to have better theoretical properties than other aggregation methods that can be found in the literature. Contrarily to some other methods it can be shown that the proposed aggregation method is consistent. Finally, the practical interest of the proposed method is illustrated on simulated datasets and on an industrial test case with $10^4$ observations in a 6-dimensional space."}
{"text": "Concentration inequalities are indispensable tools for studying the generalization capacity of learning models. Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities are commonly used, giving bounds independent of the data distribution. Although this makes them widely applicable, a drawback is that the bounds can be too loose in some specific cases. Although efforts have been devoted to improving the bounds, we find that the bounds can be further tightened in some distribution-dependent scenarios and conditions for the inequalities can be relaxed. In particular, we propose four types of conditions for probabilistic boundedness and bounded differences, and derive several distribution-dependent extensions of Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities. These extensions provide bounds for functions not satisfying the conditions of the existing inequalities, and in some special cases, tighter bounds. Furthermore, we obtain generalization bounds for unbounded and hierarchy-bounded loss functions. Finally we discuss the potential applications of our extensions to learning theory."}
{"text": "We propose a method that performs anomaly detection and localisation within heterogeneous data using a pairwise undirected mixed graphical model. The data are a mixture of categorical and quantitative variables, and the model is learned over a dataset that is supposed not to contain any anomaly. We then use the model over temporal data, potentially a data stream, using a version of the two-sided CUSUM algorithm. The proposed decision statistic is based on a conditional likelihood ratio computed for each variable given the others. Our results show that this function allows to detect anomalies variable by variable, and thus to localise the variables involved in the anomalies more precisely than univariate methods based on simple marginals."}
{"text": "Most high-dimensional estimation and prediction methods propose to minimize a cost function (empirical risk) that is written as a sum of losses associated to each data point. In this paper we focus on the case of non-convex losses, which is practically important but still poorly understood. Classical empirical process theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting M-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently.   In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to study the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and their properties. We establish uniform convergence of the gradient and Hessian of the empirical risk to their population counterparts, as soon as the number of samples becomes larger than the number of unknown parameters (modulo logarithmic factors). Consequently, good properties of the population risk can be carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one correspondence of their stationary points. We demonstrate that in several problems such as non-convex binary classification, robust regression, and Gaussian mixture model, this result implies a complete characterization of the landscape of the empirical risk, and of the convergence properties of descent algorithms.   We extend our analysis to the very high-dimensional setting in which the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, and provide a characterization of the empirical risk landscape under a nearly information-theoretically minimal condition. Namely, if the number of samples exceeds the sparsity of the unknown parameters vector (modulo logarithmic factors), then a suitable uniform convergence result takes place. We apply this result to non-convex binary classification and robust regression in very high-dimension."}
{"text": "Mixture models with Gamma and or inverse-Gamma distributed mixture components are useful for medical image tissue segmentation or as post-hoc models for regression coefficients obtained from linear regression within a Generalised Linear Modeling framework (GLM), used in this case to separate stochastic (Gaussian) noise from some kind of positive or negative \"activation\" (modeled as Gamma or inverse-Gamma distributed). To date, the most common choice in this context it is Gaussian/Gamma mixture models learned through a maximum likelihood (ML) approach; we recently extended such algorithm for mixture models with inverse-Gamma components. Here, we introduce a fully analytical Variational Bayes (VB) learning framework for both Gamma and/or inverse-Gamma components. We use synthetic and resting state fMRI data to compare the performance of the ML and VB algorithms in terms of area under the curve and computational cost. We observed that the ML Gaussian/Gamma model is very expensive specially when considering high resolution images; furthermore, these solutions are highly variable and they occasionally can overestimate the activations severely. The Bayesian Gauss-Gamma is in general the fastest algorithm but provides too dense solutions. The maximum likelihood Gaussian/inverse-Gamma is also very fast but provides in general very sparse solutions. The variational Gaussian/inverse-Gamma mixture model is the most robust and its cost is acceptable even for high resolution images. Further, the presented methodology represents an essential building block that can be directly used in more complex inference tasks, specially designed to analyse MRI-fMRI data; such models include for example analytical variational mixture models with adaptive spatial regularization or better source models for new spatial blind source separation approaches."}
{"text": "Preterm births occur at an alarming rate of 10-15%. Preemies have a higher risk of infant mortality, developmental retardation and long-term disabilities. Predicting preterm birth is difficult, even for the most experienced clinicians. The most well-designed clinical study thus far reaches a modest sensitivity of 18.2-24.2% at specificity of 28.6-33.3%. We take a different approach by exploiting databases of normal hospital operations. We aims are twofold: (i) to derive an easy-to-use, interpretable prediction rule with quantified uncertainties, and (ii) to construct accurate classifiers for preterm birth prediction. Our approach is to automatically generate and select from hundreds (if not thousands) of possible predictors using stability-aware techniques. Derived from a large database of 15,814 women, our simplified prediction rule with only 10 items has sensitivity of 62.3% at specificity of 81.5%."}
{"text": "We prove a central limit theorem for the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to the $d$ largest eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix of a finite dimensional random dot product graph. As a corollary, we show that for stochastic blockmodel graphs, the rows of the spectral embedding of the normalized Laplacian converge to multivariate normals and furthermore the mean and the covariance matrix of each row are functions of the associated vertex's block membership. Together with prior results for the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, we then compare, via the Chernoff information between multivariate normal distributions, how the choice of embedding method impacts subsequent inference. We demonstrate that neither embedding method dominates with respect to the inference task of recovering the latent block assignments."}
{"text": "Nonlinear similarity measures defined in kernel space, such as correntropy, can extract higher-order statistics of data and offer potentially significant performance improvement over their linear counterparts especially in non-Gaussian signal processing and machine learning. In this work, we propose a new similarity measure in kernel space, called the kernel risk-sensitive loss (KRSL), and provide some important properties. We apply the KRSL to adaptive filtering and investigate the robustness, and then develop the MKRSL algorithm and analyze the mean square convergence performance. Compared with correntropy, the KRSL can offer a more efficient performance surface, thereby enabling a gradient based method to achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy while still maintaining the robustness to outliers. Theoretical analysis results and superior performance of the new algorithm are confirmed by simulation."}
{"text": "We study probability measures induced by set functions with constraints. Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds."}
{"text": "We study the problem of demixing a pair of sparse signals from noisy, nonlinear observations of their superposition. Mathematically, we consider a nonlinear signal observation model, $y_i = g(a_i^Tx) + e_i, \\ i=1,\\ldots,m$, where $x = \\Phi w+\\Psi z$ denotes the superposition signal, $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ are orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and $w, z\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ are sparse coefficient vectors of the constituent signals, and $e_i$ represents the noise. Moreover, $g$ represents a nonlinear link function, and $a_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $i$-th row of the measurement matrix, $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$. Problems of this nature arise in several applications ranging from astronomy, computer vision, and machine learning. In this paper, we make some concrete algorithmic progress for the above demixing problem. Specifically, we consider two scenarios: (i) the case when the demixing procedure has no knowledge of the link function, and (ii) the case when the demixing algorithm has perfect knowledge of the link function. In both cases, we provide fast algorithms for recovery of the constituents $w$ and $z$ from the observations. Moreover, we support these algorithms with a rigorous theoretical analysis, and derive (nearly) tight upper bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms for achieving stable recovery of the component signals. We also provide a range of numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms on both real and synthetic signals and images."}
{"text": "A genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlates marker variation with trait variation in a sample of individuals. Each study subject is genotyped at a multitude of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) spanning the genome. Here we assume that subjects are unrelated and collected at random and that trait values are normally distributed or transformed to normality. Over the past decade, researchers have been remarkably successful in applying GWAS analysis to hundreds of traits. The massive amount of data produced in these studies present unique computational challenges. Penalized regression with LASSO or MCP penalties is capable of selecting a handful of associated SNPs from millions of potential SNPs. Unfortunately, model selection can be corrupted by false positives and false negatives, obscuring the genetic underpinning of a trait. This paper introduces the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm to the GWAS analysis of continuous traits. Our parallel implementation of IHT accommodates SNP genotype compression and exploits multiple CPU cores and graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows statistical geneticists to leverage commodity desktop computers in GWAS analysis and to avoid supercomputing. We evaluate IHT performance on both simulated and real GWAS data and conclude that it reduces false positive and false negative rates while remaining competitive in computational time with penalized regression.

{"text": "Recently, a general method for analyzing the statistical accuracy of the EM algorithm has been developed and applied to some simple latent variable models [Balakrishnan et al. 2016]. In that method, the basin of attraction for valid initialization is required to be a ball around the truth. Using Stein's Lemma, we extend these results in the case of estimating the centers of a two-component Gaussian mixture in $d$ dimensions. In particular, we significantly expand the basin of attraction to be the intersection of a half space and a ball around the origin. If the signal-to-noise ratio is at least a constant multiple of $ \\sqrt{d\\log d} $, we show that a random initialization strategy is feasible."}
{"text": "Boosting combines weak (biased) learners to obtain effective learning algorithms for classification and prediction. In this paper, we show a connection between boosting and kernel-based methods, highlighting both theoretical and practical applications. In the context of $\\ell_2$ boosting, we start with a weak linear learner defined by a kernel $K$. We show that boosting with this learner is equivalent to estimation with a special {\\it boosting kernel} that depends on $K$, as well as on the regression matrix, noise variance, and hyperparameters. The number of boosting iterations is modeled as a continuous hyperparameter, and fit along with other parameters using standard techniques.   We then generalize the boosting kernel to a broad new class of boosting approaches for more general weak learners, including those based on the $\\ell_1$, hinge and Vapnik losses. The approach allows fast hyperparameter tuning for this general class, and has a wide range of applications, including robust regression and classification. We illustrate some of these applications with numerical examples on synthetic and real data."}
{"text": "Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) are powerful models for sequential data but they do not scale well with long sequences. We propose a scalable inference and learning algorithm for FHMMs that draws on ideas from the stochastic variational inference, neural network and copula literatures. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed algorithm requires no message passing procedure among latent variables and can be distributed to a network of computers to speed up learning. Our experiments corroborate that the proposed algorithm does not introduce further approximation bias compared to the proven structured mean-field algorithm, and achieves better performance with long sequences and large FHMMs."}
{"text": "Machine learning methods are used to discover complex nonlinear relationships in biological and medical data. However, sophisticated learning models are computationally unfeasible for data with millions of features. Here we introduce the first feature selection method for nonlinear learning problems that can scale up to large, ultra-high dimensional biological data. More specifically, we scale up the novel Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion Lasso (HSIC Lasso) to handle millions of features with tens of thousand samples. The proposed method is guaranteed to find an optimal subset of maximally predictive features with minimal redundancy, yielding higher predictive power and improved interpretability. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through applications to classify phenotypes based on module expression in human prostate cancer patients and to detect enzymes among protein structures. We achieve high accuracy with as few as 20 out of one million features --- a dimensionality reduction of 99.998%. Our algorithm can be implemented on commodity cloud computing platforms. The dramatic reduction of features may lead to the ubiquitous deployment of sophisticated prediction models in mobile health care applications."}
{"text": "This paper considers \\emph{volume minimization} (VolMin)-based structured matrix factorization (SMF). VolMin is a factorization criterion that decomposes a given data matrix into a basis matrix times a structured coefficient matrix via finding the minimum-volume simplex that encloses all the columns of the data matrix. Recent work showed that VolMin guarantees the identifiability of the factor matrices under mild conditions that are realistic in a wide variety of applications. This paper focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of VolMin. On the theory side, exact equivalence of two independently developed sufficient conditions for VolMin identifiability is proven here, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of this aspect of VolMin. On the algorithm side, computational complexity and sensitivity to outliers are two key challenges associated with real-world applications of VolMin. These are addressed here via a new VolMin algorithm that handles volume regularization in a computationally simple way, and automatically detects and {iteratively downweights} outliers, simultaneously. Simulations and real-data experiments using a remotely sensed hyperspectral image and the Reuters document corpus are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

Experiments conducted as part of this study suggest that this approach can be useful in the analysis and exploration of big datasets with a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes."}
{"text": "Exploration of hydrocarbon resources is a highly complicated and expensive process where various geological, geochemical and geophysical factors are developed then combined together. It is highly significant how to design the seismic data acquisition survey and locate the exploratory wells since incorrect or imprecise locations lead to waste of time and money during the operation. The objective of this study is to locate high-potential oil and gas field in 1: 250,000 sheet of Ahwaz including 20 oil fields to reduce both time and costs in exploration and production processes. In this regard, 17 maps were developed using GIS functions for factors including: minimum and maximum of total organic carbon (TOC), yield potential for hydrocarbons production (PP), Tmax peak, production index (PI), oxygen index (OI), hydrogen index (HI) as well as presence or proximity to high residual Bouguer gravity anomalies, proximity to anticline axis and faults, topography and curvature maps obtained from Asmari Formation subsurface contours. To model and to integrate maps, this study employed artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The results obtained from model validation demonstrated that the 17x10x5 neural network with R=0.8948, RMS=0.0267, and kappa=0.9079 can be trained better than other models such as ANFIS and predicts the potential areas more accurately. However, this method failed to predict some oil fields and wrongly predict some areas as potential zones."}
{"text": "The Kalman filter (KF) is used in a variety of applications for computing the posterior distribution of latent states in a state space model. The model requires a linear relationship between states and observations. Extensions to the Kalman filter have been proposed that incorporate linear approximations to nonlinear models, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). However, we argue that in cases where the dimensionality of observed variables greatly exceeds the dimensionality of state variables, a model for $p(\\text{state}|\\text{observation})$ proves both easier to learn and more accurate for latent space estimation. We derive and validate what we call the discriminative Kalman filter (DKF): a closed-form discriminative version of Bayesian filtering that readily incorporates off-the-shelf discriminative learning techniques. Further, we demonstrate that given mild assumptions, highly non-linear models for $p(\\text{state}|\\text{observation})$ can be specified. We motivate and validate on synthetic datasets and in neural decoding from non-human primates, showing substantial increases in decoding performance versus the standard Kalman filter."}

{"text": "The unscented transformation (UT) is an efficient method to solve the state estimation problem for a non-linear dynamic system, utilizing a derivative-free higher-order approximation by approximating a Gaussian distribution rather than approximating a non-linear function. Applying the UT to a Kalman filter type estimator leads to the well-known unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Although the UKF works very well in Gaussian noises, its performance may deteriorate significantly when the noises are non-Gaussian, especially when the system is disturbed by some heavy-tailed impulsive noises. To improve the robustness of the UKF against impulsive noises, a new filter for nonlinear systems is proposed in this work, namely the maximum correntropy unscented filter (MCUF). In MCUF, the UT is applied to obtain the prior estimates of the state and covariance matrix, and a robust statistical linearization regression based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is then used to obtain the posterior estimates of the state and covariance. The satisfying performance of the new algorithm is confirmed by two illustrative examples."}
{"text": "Kernel-based K-means clustering has gained popularity due to its simplicity and the power of its implicit non-linear representation of the data. A dominant concern is the memory requirement since memory scales as the square of the number of data points. We provide a new analysis of a class of approximate kernel methods that have more modest memory requirements, and propose a specific one-pass randomized kernel approximation followed by standard K-means on the transformed data. The analysis and experiments suggest the method is accurate, while requiring drastically less memory than standard kernel K-means and significantly less memory than Nystrom based approximations."}
{"text": "Manifold Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been introduced to sample more effectively from challenging target densities exhibiting multiple modes or strong correlations. Such algorithms exploit the local geometry of the parameter space, thus enabling chains to achieve a faster convergence rate when measured in number of steps. However, acquiring local geometric information can often increase computational complexity per step to the extent that sampling from high-dimensional targets becomes inefficient in terms of total computational time. This paper analyzes the computational complexity of manifold Langevin Monte Carlo and proposes a geometric adaptive Monte Carlo sampler aimed at balancing the benefits of exploiting local geometry with computational cost to achieve a high effective sample size for a given computational cost. The suggested sampler is a discrete-time stochastic process in random environment. The random environment allows to switch between local geometric and adaptive proposal kernels with the help of a schedule. An exponential schedule is put forward that enables more frequent use of geometric information in early transient phases of the chain, while saving computational time in late stationary phases. The average complexity can be manually set depending on the need for geometric exploitation posed by the underlying model."}
{"text": "An incremental/online state dynamic learning method is proposed for identification of the nonlinear Gaussian state space models. The method embeds the stochastic variational sparse Gaussian process as the probabilistic state dynamic model inside a particle filter framework. Model updating is done at measurement sample rate using stochastic gradient descent based optimization implemented in the state estimation filtering loop. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian process based batch learning methods. Finally, it is shown that the state estimation performance significantly improves due to the online learning of state dynamics."}
{"text": "Gaussian graphical models are widely used to represent conditional dependence among random variables. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for data arising from a group of Gaussian graphical models that are themselves dependent. A motivating example is that of modeling gene expression collected on multiple tissues from the same individual: here the multivariate outcome is affected by dependencies acting not only at the level of the specific tissues, but also at the level of the whole body; existing methods that assume independence among graphs are not applicable in this case. To estimate multiple dependent graphs, we decompose the problem into two graphical layers: the systemic layer, which affects all outcomes and thereby induces cross- graph dependence, and the category-specific layer, which represents graph-specific variation. We propose a graphical EM technique that estimates both layers jointly, establish estimation consistency and selection sparsistency of the proposed estimator, and confirm by simulation that the EM method is superior to a simple one-step method. We apply our technique to mouse genomics data and obtain biologically plausible results."}
{"text": "Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, that are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). However, these methods don't exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks was proposed in \\cite{Gregor10}, coined LISTA, which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately.   In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails."}
{"text": "We develop an automated variational method for inference in models with Gaussian process (GP) priors and general likelihoods. The method supports multiple outputs and multiple latent functions and does not require detailed knowledge of the conditional likelihood, only needing its evaluation as a black-box function. Using a mixture of Gaussians as the variational distribution, we show that the evidence lower bound and its gradients can be estimated efficiently using samples from univariate Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, the method is scalable to large datasets which is achieved by using an augmented prior via the inducing-variable approach underpinning most sparse GP approximations, along with parallel computation and stochastic optimization. We evaluate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively with experiments on small datasets, medium-scale datasets and large datasets, showing its competitiveness under different likelihood models and sparsity levels. On the large-scale experiments involving prediction of airline delays and classification of handwritten digits, we show that our method is on par with the state-of-the-art hard-coded approaches for scalable GP regression and classification."}
{"text": "This work presents PESMOC, Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Constraints, an information-based strategy for the simultaneous optimization of multiple expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions under the presence of several constraints. PESMOC can hence be used to solve a wide range of optimization problems. Iteratively, PESMOC chooses an input location on which to evaluate the objective functions and the constraints so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the Pareto set of the corresponding optimization problem. The constraints considered in PESMOC are assumed to have similar properties to those of the objective functions in typical Bayesian optimization problems. That is, they do not have a known expression (which prevents gradient computation), their evaluation is considered to be very expensive, and the resulting observations may be corrupted by noise. These constraints arise in a plethora of expensive black-box optimization problems. We carry out synthetic experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of PESMOC, where we sample both the objectives and the constraints from a Gaussian process prior. The results obtained show that PESMOC is able to provide better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations than a strategy based on random search."}
{"text": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, the interpretability of PCA remains limited. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as Sparse PCA, have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images accounting for most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining l1 and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes higher order information about the structure of the data. This paper presents the structured sparse PCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of SPCA-TV on three different data sets. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches are significant,since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easy to interpret, and are more stable across different samples."}
{"text": "We develop an automated variational inference method for Bayesian structured prediction problems with Gaussian process (GP) priors and linear-chain likelihoods. Our approach does not need to know the details of the structured likelihood model and can scale up to a large number of observations. Furthermore, we show that the required expected likelihood term and its gradients in the variational objective (ELBO) can be estimated efficiently by using expectations over very low-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Optimization of the ELBO is fully parallelizable over sequences and amenable to stochastic optimization, which we use along with control variate techniques and state-of-the-art incremental optimization to make our framework useful in practice. Results on a set of natural language processing tasks show that our method can be as good as (and sometimes better than) hard-coded approaches including SVM-struct and CRFs, and overcomes the scalability limitations of previous inference algorithms based on sampling. Overall, this is a fundamental step to developing automated inference methods for Bayesian structured prediction."}
{"text": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates proposals for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by simulating the dynamics of a Hamiltonian system. However, HMC is sensitive to large time discretizations and performs poorly if there is a mismatch between the spatial geometry of the target distribution and the scales of the momentum distribution. In particular the mass matrix of HMC is hard to tune well. In order to alleviate these problems we propose relativistic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a version of HMC based on relativistic dynamics that introduce a maximum velocity on particles. We also derive stochastic gradient versions of the algorithm and show that the resulting algorithms bear interesting relationships to gradient clipping, RMSprop, Adagrad and Adam, popular optimisation methods in deep learning. Based on this, we develop relativistic stochastic gradient descent by taking the zero-temperature limit of relativistic stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In experiments we show that the relativistic algorithms perform better than classical Newtonian variants and Adam."}
{"text": "Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) is an elegant approach for unsupervised segmentation if the data points of each cluster are located in linear subspaces.

SSC requires that problems based on the $l_1$-norm are solved to infer which points belong to the same subspace. If these unknown subspaces are well-separated this algorithm is guaranteed to succeed. The algorithm rests upon the assumption that points on the same subspace are well spread. The question what happens if this condition is violated has not yet been investigated. In this work, the effect of particular distributions on the same subspace will be analyzed. It will be shown that SSC fails to infer correct labels if points on the same subspace fall into more than one cluster."}
{"text": "Understanding the relationships between different properties of data, such as whether a connectome or genome has information about disease status, is becoming increasingly important in modern biological datasets. While existing approaches can test whether two properties are related, they often require unfeasibly large sample sizes in real data scenarios, and do not provide any insight into how or why the procedure reached its decision. Our approach, \"Multiscale Graph Correlation\" (MGC), is a dependence test that juxtaposes previously disparate data science techniques, including k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods (such as support vector machines), and multiscale analysis (such as wavelets). Other methods typically require double or triple the number samples to achieve the same statistical power as MGC in a benchmark suite including high-dimensional and nonlinear relationships - spanning polynomial (linear, quadratic, cubic), trigonometric (sinusoidal, circular, ellipsoidal, spiral), geometric (square, diamond, W-shape), and other functions, with dimensionality ranging from 1 to 1000. Moreover, MGC uniquely provides a simple and elegant characterization of the potentially complex latent geometry underlying the relationship, providing insight while maintaining computational efficiency. In several real data applications, including brain imaging and cancer genetics, MGC is the only method that can both detect the presence of a dependency and provide specific guidance for the next experiment and/or analysis to conduct."}
{"text": "We extend the adaptive regression spline model by incorporating saturation, the natural requirement that a function extend as a constant outside a certain range. We fit saturating splines to data using a convex optimization problem over a space of measures, which we solve using an efficient algorithm based on the conditional gradient method. Unlike many existing approaches, our algorithm solves the original infinite-dimensional (for splines of degree at least two) optimization problem without pre-specified knot locations. We then adapt our algorithm to fit generalized additive models with saturating splines as coordinate functions and show that the saturation requirement allows our model to simultaneously perform feature selection and nonlinear function fitting. Finally, we briefly sketch how the method can be extended to higher order splines and to different requirements on the extension outside the data range."}
{"text": "In many applications (in particular information systems, such as pattern recognition, machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics to name but a few) the assessment of uncertainty is essential - i.e., the estimation of the underlying probability distribution function. More often than not, the form of this function is unknown and it becomes necessary to non-parametrically construct/estimate it from a given sample. One of the methods of choice to non-parametrically estimate the unknown probability distribution function for a given random variable (defined on binary space) has been the expansion of the estimation function in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions. In this paper we demonstrate that the expansion of the probability distribution function estimation in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions is equivalent to the expansion of the function estimation in a set of \"Dirac kernel\" functions. The latter approach can ameliorate the computational bottleneck and notational awkwardness often associated with the Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions approach, in particular when the binary input space is large."}
{"text": "The softmax representation of probabilities for categorical variables plays a prominent role in modern machine learning with numerous applications in areas such as large scale classification, neural language modeling and recommendation systems. However, softmax estimation is very expensive for large scale inference because of the high cost associated with computing the normalizing constant. Here, we introduce an efficient approximation to softmax probabilities which takes the form of a rigorous lower bound on the exact probability. This bound is expressed as a product over pairwise probabilities and it leads to scalable estimation based on stochastic optimization. It allows us to perform doubly stochastic estimation by subsampling both training instances and class labels. We show that the new bound has interesting theoretical properties and we demonstrate its use in classification problems."}
{"text": "Variational inference lies at the core of many state-of-the-art algorithms. To improve the approximation of the posterior beyond parametric families, it was proposed to include MCMC steps into the variational lower bound. In this work we explore this idea using steps of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, an efficient MCMC method. In particular, we incorporate the acceptance step of the HMC algorithm, guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the true posterior. Additionally, we introduce some extensions to the HMC algorithm geared towards faster convergence. The theoretical advantages of these modifications are reflected by performance improvements in our experimental results."}
{"text": "With the scale of data growing every day, reducing the dimensionality (a.k.a. sketching) of high-dimensional data has emerged as a task of paramount importance. Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume of data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format of acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these challenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning approach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical (bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit and Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process lying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies on low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized maximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via alternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical data `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new incomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight first-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an extra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly along with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models. Performance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite data streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary point set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear regret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes for real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification."}
{"text": "To date, the instability of prognostic predictors in a sparse high dimensional model, which hinders their clinical adoption, has received little attention. Stable prediction is often overlooked in favour of performance. Yet, stability prevails as key when adopting models in critical areas as healthcare. Our study proposes a stabilization scheme by detecting higher order feature correlations. Using a linear model as basis for prediction, we achieve feature stability by regularising latent correlation in features. Latent higher order correlation among features is modelled using an autoencoder network. Stability is enhanced by combining a recent technique that uses a feature graph, and augmenting external unlabelled data for training the autoencoder network. Our experiments are conducted on a heart failure cohort from an Australian hospital. Stability was measured using Consistency index for feature subsets and signal-to-noise ratio for model parameters. Our methods demonstrated significant improvement in feature stability and model estimation stability when compared to baselines."}
{"text": "Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical models that are useful for representing high-dimensional probability distributions. There has been a great deal of interest in recent years in the NP-hard problem of learning the structure of a BN from observed data. Typically, one assigns a score to various structures and the search becomes an optimization problem that can be approached with either deterministic or stochastic methods. In this paper, we walk through the space of graphs by modeling the appearance and disappearance of edges as a birth and death process and compare our novel approach to the popular Metropolis-Hastings search strategy. We give empirical evidence that the birth and death process has superior mixing properties."}
{"text": "Gaussian processes are powerful, yet analytically tractable models for supervised learning. A Gaussian process is characterized by a mean function and a covariance function (kernel), which are determined by a model selection criterion. The functions to be compared do not just differ in their parametrization but in their fundamental structure. It is often not clear which function structure to choose, for instance to decide between a squared exponential and a rational quadratic kernel. Based on the principle of approximation set coding, we develop a framework for model selection to rank kernels for Gaussian process regression. In our experiments approximation set coding shows promise to become a model selection criterion competitive with maximum evidence (also called marginal likelihood) and leave-one-out cross-validation."}
{"text": "Motivated by electricity consumption metering, we extend existing nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms to use linear measurements as observations, instead of matrix entries. The objective is to estimate multiple time series at a fine temporal scale from temporal aggregates measured on each individual series. Furthermore, our algorithm is extended to take into account individual autocorrelation to provide better estimation, using a recent convex relaxation of quadratically constrained quadratic program. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world electricity consumption datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our matrix recovery algorithms."}
{"text": "Constrained adaptive filtering algorithms inculding constrained least mean square (CLMS), constrained affine projection (CAP) and constrained recursive least squares (CRLS) have been extensively studied in many applications. Most existing constrained adaptive filtering algorithms are developed under mean square error (MSE) criterion, which is an ideal optimality criterion under Gaussian noises. This assumption however fails to model the behavior of non-Gaussian noises found in practice. Motivated by the robustness and simplicity of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) in non-Gaussian impulsive noises, this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering algorithm called constrained maximum correntropy criterion (CMCC). Specifically, CMCC incorporates a linear constraint into a MCC filter to solve a constrained optimization problem explicitly. The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm is easy to implement and has low computational complexity, and in terms of convergence accuracy (say lower mean square deviation) and stability, can significantly outperform those MSE based constrained adaptive algorithms in presence of heavy-tailed impulsive noises. Additionally, the mean square convergence behaviors are studied under energy conservation relation, and a sufficient condition to ensure the mean square convergence and the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) of the proposed algorithm are obtained. Simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions under both Gaussian and non- Gaussian noises, and demonstrate the excellent performance of the novel algorithm by comparing it with other conventional methods."}
{"text": "The reparameterization gradient has become a widely used method to obtain Monte Carlo gradients to optimize the variational objective. However, this technique does not easily apply to commonly used distributions such as beta or gamma without further approximations, and most practical applications of the reparameterization gradient fit Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we introduce the generalized reparameterization gradient, a method that extends the reparameterization gradient to a wider class of variational distributions. Generalized reparameterizations use invertible transformations of the latent variables which lead to transformed distributions that weakly depend on the variational parameters. This results in new Monte Carlo gradients that combine reparameterization gradients and score function gradients. We demonstrate our approach on variational inference for two complex probabilistic models. The generalized reparameterization is effective: even a single sample from the variational distribution is enough to obtain a low-variance gradient."}
{"text": "We propose a nonparametric sequential test that aims to address two practical problems pertinent to online randomized experiments: (i) how to do a hypothesis test for complex metrics; (ii) how to prevent type $1$ error inflation under continuous monitoring. The proposed test does not require knowledge of the underlying probability distribution generating the data. We use the bootstrap to estimate the likelihood for blocks of data followed by mixture sequential probability ratio test. We validate this procedure on data from a major online e-commerce website. We show that the proposed test controls type $1$ error at any time, has good power, is robust to misspecification in the distribution generating the data, and allows quick inference in online randomized experiments."}
{"text": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are successful deep generative models. GANs are based on a two-player minimax game. However, the objective function derived in the original motivation is changed to obtain stronger gradients when learning the generator. We propose a novel algorithm that repeats the density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. Our algorithm offers a new perspective toward the understanding of GANs and is able to make use of multiple viewpoints obtained in the research of density ratio estimation, e.g. what divergence is stable and relative density ratio is useful."}
{"text": "We derive a novel variational expectation maximization approach based on truncated posterior distributions. Truncated distributions are proportional to exact posteriors within subsets of a discrete state space and equal zero otherwise. The treatment of the distributions' subsets as variational parameters distinguishes the approach from previous variational approaches. The specific structure of truncated distributions allows for deriving novel and mathematically grounded results, which in turn can be used to formulate novel efficient algorithms to optimize the parameters of probabilistic generative models. Most centrally, we find the variational lower bounds that correspond to truncated distributions to be given by very concise and efficiently computable expressions, while update equations for model parameters remain in their standard form. Based on these findings, we show how efficient and easily applicable meta-algorithms can be formulated that guarantee a monotonic increase of the variational bound. Example applications of the here derived framework provide novel theoretical results and learning procedures for latent variable models as well as mixture models. Furthermore, we show that truncated variation EM naturally interpolates between standard EM with full posteriors and EM based on the maximum a-posteriori state (MAP). The approach can, therefore, be regarded as a generalization of the popular `hard EM' approach towards a similarly efficient method which can capture more of the true posterior structure."}
{"text": "Extracting information from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) images has been a major area of research for more than two decades. The goal of this work is to present a new method for the analysis of fMRI data sets, that is capable to incorporate a priori available information, via an efficient optimization framework. Tests on synthetic data sets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods of this kind."}
{"text": "We study statistical inference and distributionally robust solution methods for stochastic optimization problems, focusing on confidence intervals for optimal values and solutions that achieve exact coverage asymptotically. We develop a generalized empirical likelihood framework---based on distributional uncertainty sets constructed from nonparametric $f$-divergence balls---for Hadamard differentiable functionals, and in particular, stochastic optimization problems. As consequences of this theory, we provide a principled method for choosing the size of distributional uncertainty regions to provide one- and two-sided confidence intervals that achieve exact coverage. We also give an asymptotic expansion for our distributionally robust formulation, showing how robustification regularizes problems by their variance. Finally, we show that optimizers of the distributionally robust formulations we study enjoy (essentially) the same consistency properties as those in classical sample average approximations. Our general approach applies to quickly mixing stationary sequences, including geometrically ergodic Harris recurrent Markov chains."}
{"text": "Sources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument, and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq, are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data is not properly calibrated. We propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider clustering data that is assumed to come from one of finitely many pointed convex polyhedral cones. This model is referred to as the Union of Polyhedral Cones (UOPC) model. Similar to the Union of Subspaces (UOS) model where each data from each subspace is generated from a (unknown) basis, in the UOPC model each data from each cone is assumed to be generated from a finite number of (unknown) \\emph{extreme rays}.To cluster data under this model, we consider several algorithms - (a) Sparse Subspace Clustering by Non-negative constraints Lasso (NCL), (b) Least squares approximation (LSA), and (c) K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to arrive at affinity between data points. Spectral Clustering (SC) is then applied on the resulting affinity matrix to cluster data into different polyhedral cones. We show that on an average KNN outperforms both NCL and LSA and for this algorithm we provide the deterministic conditions for correct clustering. For an affinity measure between the cones it is shown that as long as the cones are not very coherent and as long as the density of data within each cone exceeds a threshold, KNN leads to accurate clustering. Finally, simulation results on real datasets (MNIST and YaleFace datasets) depict that the proposed algorithm works well on real data indicating the utility of the UOPC model and the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "We propose a communication-efficient distributed estimation method for sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the high dimensional regime. Our method distributes the data of size $N$ into $m$ machines, and estimates a local sparse LDA estimator on each machine using the data subset of size $N/m$. After the distributed estimation, our method aggregates the debiased local estimators from $m$ machines, and sparsifies the aggregated estimator. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimation method, as long as the number of machines $m$ is chosen appropriately. Moreover, we prove that our method can attain the model selection consistency under a milder condition than the centralized method. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "Density matrices are positively semi-definite Hermitian matrices with unit trace that describe the states of quantum systems. Many quantum systems of physical interest can be represented as high-dimensional low rank density matrices. A popular problem in {\\it quantum state tomography} (QST) is to estimate the unknown low rank density matrix of a quantum system by conducting Pauli measurements. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we establish the minimax lower bounds in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$ for low rank density matrices estimation by Pauli measurements. In our previous paper, these minimax lower bounds are proved under the trace regression model with Gaussian noise and the noise is assumed to have common variance. In this paper, we prove these bounds under the Binomial observation model which meets the actual model in QST.   Second, we study the Dantzig estimator (DE) for estimating the unknown low rank density matrix under the Binomial observation model by using Pauli measurements. In our previous papers, we studied the least squares estimator and the projection estimator, where we proved the optimal convergence rates for the least squares estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq 2$ and, under a stronger condition, the optimal convergence rates for the projection estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$. In this paper, we show that the results of these two distinct estimators can be simultaneously obtained by the Dantzig estimator. Moreover, better convergence rates in Schatten norm distances can be proved for Dantzig estimator under conditions weaker than those needed in previous papers. When the objective function of DE is replaced by the negative von Neumann entropy, we obtain sharp convergence rate in Kullback-Leibler divergence."}
{"text": "Quantitative modeling of post-transcriptional regulation process is a challenging problem in systems biology. A mechanical model of the regulatory process needs to be able to describe the available spatio-temporal protein concentration and mRNA expression data and recover the continuous spatio-temporal fields. Rigorous methods are required to identify model parameters. A promising approach to deal with these difficulties is proposed using Gaussian process as a prior distribution over the latent function of protein concentration and mRNA expression. In this study, we consider a partial differential equation mechanical model with differential operators and latent function. Since the operators at stake are linear, the information from the physical model can be encoded into the kernel function. Hybrid Monte Carlo methods are employed to carry out Bayesian inference of the partial differential equation parameters and Gaussian process kernel parameters. The spatio-temporal field of protein concentration and mRNA expression are reconstructed without explicitly solving the partial differential equation."}
{"text": "Importance sampling is widely used in machine learning and statistics, but its power is limited by the restriction of using simple proposals for which the importance weights can be tractably calculated. We address this problem by studying black-box importance sampling methods that calculate importance weights for samples generated from any unknown proposal or black-box mechanism. Our method allows us to use better and richer proposals to solve difficult problems, and (somewhat counter-intuitively) also has the additional benefit of improving the estimation accuracy beyond typical importance sampling. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are provided."}
{"text": "We propose a unified framework for estimating low-rank matrices through nonconvex optimization based on gradient descent algorithm. Our framework is quite general and can be applied to both noisy and noiseless observations. In the general case with noisy observations, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix up to minimax optimal statistical error, provided an appropriate initial estimator. While in the generic noiseless setting, our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate and enables exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. In addition, we develop a new initialization algorithm to provide a desired initial estimator, which outperforms existing initialization algorithms for nonconvex low-rank matrix estimation. We illustrate the superiority of our framework through three examples: matrix regression, matrix completion, and one-bit matrix completion. We also corroborate our theory through extensive experiments on synthetic data."}
{"text": "We investigate the capabilities and limitations of Gaussian process models by jointly exploring three complementary directions: (i) scalable and statistically efficient inference; (ii) flexible kernels; and (iii) objective functions for hyperparameter learning alternative to the marginal likelihood. Our approach outperforms all previously reported GP methods on the standard MNIST dataset; performs comparatively to previous kernel-based methods using the RECTANGLES-IMAGE dataset; and breaks the 1% error-rate barrier in GP models using the MNIST8M dataset, showing along the way the scalability of our method at unprecedented scale for GP models (8 million observations) in classification problems. Overall, our approach represents a significant breakthrough in kernel methods and GP models, bridging the gap between deep learning approaches and kernel machines."}
{"text": "We provide a theoretical foundation for non-parametric estimation of functions of random variables using kernel mean embeddings. We show that for any continuous function $f$, consistent estimators of the mean embedding of a random variable $X$ lead to consistent estimators of the mean embedding of $f(X)$. For Mat\\'ern kernels and sufficiently smooth functions we also provide rates of convergence. Our results extend to functions of multiple random variables. If the variables are dependent, we require an estimator of the mean embedding of their joint distribution as a starting point; if they are independent, it is sufficient to have separate estimators of the mean embeddings of their marginal distributions. In either case, our results cover both mean embeddings based on i.i.d. samples as well as \"reduced set\" expansions in terms of dependent expansion points. The latter serves as a justification for using such expansions to limit memory resources when applying the approach as a basis for probabilistic programming."}
{"text": "The determination of cluster centers generally depends on the scale that we use to analyze the data to be clustered. Inappropriate scale usually leads to unreasonable cluster centers and thus unreasonable results. In this study, we first consider the similarity of elements in the data as the connectivity of nodes in an undirected graph, then present the concept of a connection center and regard it as the cluster center of the data. Based on this definition, the determination of cluster centers and the assignment of class are very simple, natural and effective. One more crucial finding is that the cluster centers of different scales can be obtained easily by the different powers of a similarity matrix and the change of power from small to large leads to the dynamic evolution of cluster centers from local (microscopic) to global (microscopic). Further, in this process of evolution, the number of categories changes discontinuously, which means that the presented method can automatically skip the unreasonable number of clusters, suggest appropriate observation scales and provide corresponding cluster results."}
{"text": "Effective and accurate model selection is an important problem in modern data analysis. One of the major challenges is the computational burden required to handle large data sets that cannot be stored or processed on one machine. Another challenge one may encounter is the presence of outliers and contaminations that damage the inference quality. The parallel \"divide and conquer\" model selection strategy divides the observations of the full data set into roughly equal subsets and perform inference and model selection independently on each subset. After local subset inference, this method aggregates the posterior model probabilities or other model/variable selection criteria to obtain a final model by using the notion of geometric median. This approach leads to improved concentration in finding the \"correct\" model and model parameters and also is provably robust to outliers and data contamination."}
{"text": "Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful method for blind source separation based on the assumption that sources are statistically independent. Though ICA has proven useful and has been employed in many applications, complete statistical independence can be too restrictive an assumption in practice. Additionally, important prior information about the data, such as sparsity, is usually available. Sparsity is a natural property of the data, a form of diversity, which, if incorporated into the ICA model, can relax the independence assumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance. In this work, we propose a new variant of ICA by entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM)-a flexible, yet parameter-free algorithm-through the direct exploitation of sparsity. Using this new SparseICA-EBM algorithm, we study the synergy of independence and sparsity through simulations on synthetic as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-like data."}
{"text": "The goal of two-sample tests is to assess whether two samples, $S_P \\sim P^n$ and $S_Q \\sim Q^m$, are drawn from the same distribution. Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis \"$P = Q$\" is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level. As we will show, such Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ. The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST. First, we analyze their main theoretical properties. Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives. Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery."}
{"text": "Recent advances in Bayesian learning with large-scale data have witnessed emergence of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC), such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian MCMC (SGHMC), and the stochastic gradient thermostat. While finite-time convergence properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In this paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and develop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their asymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric splitting integrator, the {\\em mean square error} (MSE) of the posterior average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$ iterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs are also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method in two large-scale real applications."}
{"text": "We present a sparse estimation and dictionary learning framework for compressed fiber sensing based on a probabilistic hierarchical sparse model. To handle severe dictionary coherence, selective shrinkage is achieved using a Weibull prior, which can be related to non-convex optimization with $p$-norm constraints for $0 < p < 1$. In addition, we leverage the specific dictionary structure to promote collective shrinkage based on a local similarity model. This is incorporated in form of a kernel function in the joint prior density of the sparse coefficients, thereby establishing a Markov random field-relation. Approximate inference is accomplished using a hybrid technique that combines Hamilton Monte Carlo and Gibbs sampling. To estimate the dictionary parameter, we pursue two strategies, relying on either a deterministic or a probabilistic model for the dictionary parameter. In the first strategy, the parameter is estimated based on alternating estimation. In the second strategy, it is jointly estimated along with the sparse coefficients. The performance is evaluated in comparison to an existing method in various scenarios using simulations and experimental data."}
{"text": "Gradient matching with Gaussian processes is a promising tool for learning parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODE's). The essence of gradient matching is to model the prior over state variables as a Gaussian process which implies that the joint distribution given the ODE's and GP kernels is also Gaussian distributed. The state-derivatives are integrated out analytically since they are modelled as latent variables. However, the state variables themselves are also latent variables because they are contaminated by noise. Previous work sampled the state variables since integrating them out is \\textit{not} analytically tractable. In this paper we use mean-field approximation to establish tight variational lower bounds that decouple state variables and are therefore, in contrast to the integral over state variables, analytically tractable and even concave for a restricted family of ODE's, including nonlinear and periodic ODE's. Such variational lower bounds facilitate \"hill climbing\" to determine the maximum a posteriori estimate of ODE parameters. An additional advantage of our approach over sampling methods is the determination of a proxy to the intractable posterior distribution over state variables given observations and the ODE's."}
{"text": "Independent component analysis (ICA) is the most popular method for blind source separation (BSS) with a diverse set of applications, such as biomedical signal processing, video and image analysis, and communications. Maximum likelihood (ML), an optimal theoretical framework for ICA, requires knowledge of the true underlying probability density function (PDF) of the latent sources, which, in many applications, is unknown. ICA algorithms cast in the ML framework often deviate from its theoretical optimality properties due to poor estimation of the source PDF. Therefore, accurate estimation of source PDFs is critical in order to avoid model mismatch and poor ICA performance. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient ICA algorithm based on entropy maximization with kernels, (ICA-EMK), which uses both global and local measuring functions as constraints to dynamically estimate the PDF of the sources with reasonable complexity. In addition, the new algorithm performs optimization with respect to each of the cost function gradient directions separately, enabling parallel implementations on multi-core computers. We demonstrate the superior performance of ICA-EMK over competing ICA algorithms using simulated as well as real-world data."}
{"text": "In this paper, we develop a new sequential regression modeling approach for data streams. Data streams are commonly found around us, e.g in a retail enterprise sales data is continuously collected every day. A demand forecasting model is an important outcome from the data that needs to be continuously updated with the new incoming data. The main challenge in such modeling arises when there is a) high dimensional and sparsity, b) need for an adaptive use of prior knowledge, and/or c) structural changes in the system. The proposed approach addresses these challenges by incorporating an adaptive L1-penalty and inertia terms in the loss function, and thus called Inertial Regularization and Selection (IRS). The former term performs model selection to handle the first challenge while the latter is shown to address the last two challenges. A recursive estimation algorithm is developed, and shown to outperform the commonly used state-space models, such as Kalman Filters, in experimental studies and real data."}
{"text": "Datasets containing large samples of time-to-event data arising from several small heterogeneous groups are commonly encountered in statistics. This presents problems as they cannot be pooled directly due to their heterogeneity or analyzed individually because of their small sample size. Bayesian nonparametric modelling approaches can be used to model such datasets given their ability to flexibly share information across groups. In this paper, we will compare three popular Bayesian nonparametric methods for modelling the survival functions of heterogeneous groups. Specifically, we will first compare the modelling accuracy of the Dirichlet process, the hierarchical Dirichlet process, and the nested Dirichlet process on simulated datasets of different sizes, where group survival curves differ in shape or in expectation. We, then, will compare the models on a real-world injury dataset."}
{"text": "We introduce a mixture model for censored durations (C-mix), and develop maximum likelihood inference for the joint estimation of the time distributions and latent regression parameters of the model. We consider a high-dimensional setting, with datasets containing a large number of biomedical covariates. We therefore penalize the negative log-likelihood by the Elastic-Net, which leads to a sparse parameterization of the model. Inference is achieved using an efficient Quasi-Newton Expectation Maximization (QNEM) algorithm, for which we provide convergence properties. We then propose a score by assessing the patients risk of early adverse event. The statistical performance of the method is examined on an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, and finally illustrated on three genetic datasets with high-dimensional covariates. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, namely both the CURE and Cox proportional hazards models for this task, both in terms of C-index and AUC(t)."}
{"text": "We propose a parallelizable sparse inverse formulation Gaussian process (SpInGP) for temporal models. It uses a sparse precision GP formulation and sparse matrix routines to speed up the computations. Due to the state-space formulation used in the algorithm, the time complexity of the basic SpInGP is linear, and because all the computations are parallelizable, the parallel form of the algorithm is sublinear in the number of data points. We provide example algorithms to implement the sparse matrix routines and experimentally test the method using both simulated and real data."}
{"text": "In this paper we investigate a link between state- space models and Gaussian Processes (GP) for time series modeling and forecasting. In particular, several widely used state- space models are transformed into continuous time form and corresponding Gaussian Process kernels are derived. Experimen- tal results demonstrate that the derived GP kernels are correct and appropriate for Gaussian Process Regression. An experiment with a real world dataset shows that the modeling is identical with state-space models and with the proposed GP kernels. The considered connection allows the researchers to look at their models from a different angle and facilitate sharing ideas between these two different modeling approaches."}
{"text": "Directed networks are pervasive both in nature and engineered systems, often underlying the complex behavior observed in biological systems, microblogs and social interactions over the web, as well as global financial markets. Since their structures are often unobservable, in order to facilitate network analytics, one generally resorts to approaches capitalizing on measurable nodal processes to infer the unknown topology. Structural equation models (SEMs) are capable of incorporating exogenous inputs to resolve inherent directional ambiguities. However, conventional SEMs assume full knowledge of exogenous inputs, which may not be readily available in some practical settings. The present paper advocates a novel SEM-based topology inference approach that entails factorization of a three-way tensor, constructed from the observed nodal data, using the well-known parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. It turns out that second-order piecewise stationary statistics of exogenous variables suffice to identify the hidden topology. Capitalizing on the uniqueness properties inherent to high-order tensor factorizations, it is shown that topology identification is possible under reasonably mild conditions. In addition, to facilitate real-time operation and inference of time-varying networks, an adaptive (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition scheme which tracks the topology-revealing tensor factors is developed. Extensive tests on simulated and real stock quote data demonstrate the merits of the novel tensor-based approach."}
{"text": "Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These \"recurrent\" switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable."}
{"text": "Despite the fundamental nature of the inhomogeneous Poisson process in the theory and application of stochastic processes, and its attractive generalizations (e.g. Cox process), few tractable nonparametric modeling approaches of intensity functions exist, especially when observed points lie in a high-dimensional space. In this paper we develop a new, computationally tractable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) formulation for the inhomogeneous Poisson process. We model the square root of the intensity as an RKHS function. Whereas RKHS models used in supervised learning rely on the so-called representer theorem, the form of the inhomogeneous Poisson process likelihood means that the representer theorem does not apply. However, we prove that the representer theorem does hold in an appropriately transformed RKHS, guaranteeing that the optimization of the penalized likelihood can be cast as a tractable finite-dimensional problem. The resulting approach is simple to implement, and readily scales to high dimensions and large-scale datasets."}
{"text": "The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been widely used in statistical estimation for large-scale data due to its computational and memory efficiency. While most existing works focus on the convergence of the objective function or the error of the obtained solution, we investigate the problem of statistical inference of true model parameters based on SGD when the population loss function is strongly convex and satisfies certain smoothness conditions. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, in the fixed dimension setup, we propose two consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariance of the average iterate from SGD: (1) a plug-in estimator, and (2) a batch-means estimator, which is computationally more efficient and only uses the iterates from SGD. Both proposed estimators allow us to construct asymptotically exact confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Second, for high-dimensional linear regression, using a variant of the SGD algorithm, we construct a debiased estimator of each regression coefficient that is asymptotically normal. This gives a one-pass algorithm for computing both the sparse regression coefficients and confidence intervals, which is computationally attractive and applicable to online data."}

{"text": "This paper proposes a subspace decomposition method based on an over-complete dictionary in sparse representation, called \"Sparse Signal Subspace Decomposition\" (or 3SD) method. This method makes use of a novel criterion based on the occurrence frequency of atoms of the dictionary over the data set. This criterion, well adapted to subspace-decomposition over a dependent basis set, adequately re ects the intrinsic characteristic of regularity of the signal. The 3SD method combines variance, sparsity and component frequency criteria into an unified framework. It takes benefits from using an over-complete dictionary which preserves details and from subspace decomposition which rejects strong noise. The 3SD method is very simple with a linear retrieval operation. It does not require any prior knowledge on distributions or parameters. When applied to image denoising, it demonstrates high performances both at preserving fine details and suppressing strong noise."}
{"text": "Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a popular tool for data exploration. Bayesian NMF promises to also characterize uncertainty in the factorization. Unfortunately, current inference approaches such as MCMC mix slowly and tend to get stuck on single modes. We introduce a novel approach using rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) to asymptotically cover regions of high posterior density. These are placed in a principled Bayesian framework via an online extension to nonparametric variational inference. On experiments on real and synthetic data, we obtain greater coverage of the posterior and higher ELBO values than standard NMF inference approaches."}
{"text": "We propose a geometric algorithm for topic learning and inference that is built on the convex geometry of topics arising from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and its nonparametric extensions. To this end we study the optimization of a geometric loss function, which is a surrogate to the LDA's likelihood. Our method involves a fast optimization based weighted clustering procedure augmented with geometric corrections, which overcomes the computational and statistical inefficiencies encountered by other techniques based on Gibbs sampling and variational inference, while achieving the accuracy comparable to that of a Gibbs sampler. The topic estimates produced by our method are shown to be statistically consistent under some conditions. The algorithm is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated and real data."}
{"text": "Regularised canonical correlation analysis was recently extended to more than two sets of variables by the multiblock method Regularised generalised canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA). Further, Sparse GCCA (SGCCA) was proposed to address the issue of variable selection. However, for technical reasons, the variable selection offered by SGCCA was restricted to a covariance link between the blocks (i.e., with $\\tau=1$). One of the main contributions of this paper is to go beyond the covariance link and to propose an extension of SGCCA for the full RGCCA model (i.e., with $\\tau\\in[0, 1]$). In addition, we propose an extension of SGCCA that exploits structural relationships between variables within blocks. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that allows structured and sparsity-inducing penalties to be included in the RGCCA optimisation problem. The proposed multiblock method is illustrated on a real three-block high-grade glioma data set, where the aim is to predict the location of the brain tumours, and on a simulated data set, where the aim is to illustrate the method's ability to reconstruct the true underlying weight vectors."}
{"text": "Exploiting the fact that most arrival processes exhibit cyclic behaviour, we propose a simple procedure for estimating the intensity of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The estimator is the super-resolution analogue to Shao 2010 and Shao & Lii 2011, which is a sum of $p$ sinusoids where $p$ and the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each wave are not known and need to be estimated. This results in an interpretable yet flexible specification that is suitable for use in modelling as well as in high resolution simulations.   Our estimation procedure sits in between classic periodogram methods and atomic/total variation norm thresholding. Through a novel use of window functions in the point process domain, our approach attains super-resolution without semidefinite programming. Under suitable conditions, finite sample guarantees can be derived for our procedure. These resolve some open questions and expand existing results in spectral estimation literature."}
{"text": "We propose a methodology to explore and measure the pairwise correlations that exist between variables in a dataset. The methodology leverages copulas for encoding dependence between two variables, state-of-the-art optimal transport for providing a relevant geometry to the copulas, and clustering for summarizing the main dependence patterns found between the variables. Some of the clusters centers can be used to parameterize a novel dependence coefficient which can target or forget specific dependence patterns. Finally, we illustrate and benchmark the methodology on several datasets. Code and numerical experiments are available online for reproducible research."}
{"text": "The analysis of nonstationary time series is of great importance in many scientific fields such as physics and neuroscience. In recent years, Gaussian process regression has attracted substantial attention as a robust and powerful method for analyzing time series. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing nonstationary time series using locally stationary Gaussian process analysis with parameters that are coupled through a hidden Markov model. The main advantage of this framework is that arbitrary complex nonstationary covariance functions can be obtained by combining simpler stationary building blocks whose hidden parameters can be estimated in closed-form. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by analyzing two examples of synthetic nonstationary signals: oscillations with time varying frequency and time series with two dynamical states. Finally, we report an example application on real magnetoencephalographic measurements of brain activity."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of constructing diffusion operators high dimensional data $X$ to address counterfactual functions $F$, such as individualized treatment effectiveness. We propose and construct a new diffusion metric $K_F$ that captures both the local geometry of $X$ and the directions of variance of $F$. The resulting diffusion metric is then used to define a localized filtration of $F$ and answer counterfactual questions pointwise, particularly in situations such as drug trials where an individual patient's outcomes cannot be studied long term both taking and not taking a medication. We validate the model on synthetic and real world clinical trials, and create individualized notions of benefit from treatment."}
{"text": "We propose a new method of discovering causal relationships in temporal data based on the notion of causal compression. To this end, we adopt the Pearlian graph setting and the directed information as an information theoretic tool for quantifying causality. We introduce chain rule for directed information and use it to motivate causal sparsity. We show two applications of the proposed method: causal time series segmentation which selects time points capturing the incoming and outgoing causal flow between time points belonging to different signals, and causal bipartite graph recovery. We prove that modelling of causality in the adopted set-up only requires estimating the copula density of the data distribution and thus does not depend on its marginals. We evaluate the method on time resolved gene expression data."}
{"text": "Kernel dependence measures yield accurate estimates of nonlinear relations between random variables, and they are also endorsed with solid theoretical properties and convergence rates. Besides, the empirical estimates are easy to compute in closed form just involving linear algebra operations. However, they are hampered by two important problems: the high computational cost involved, as two kernel matrices of the sample size have to be computed and stored, and the interpretability of the measure, which remains hidden behind the implicit feature map. We here address these two issues. We introduce the Sensitivity Maps (SMs) for the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Sensitivity maps allow us to explicitly analyze and visualize the relative relevance of both examples and features on the dependence measure. We also present the randomized HSIC (RHSIC) and its corresponding sensitivity maps to cope with large scale problems. We build upon the framework of random features and the Bochner's theorem to approximate the involved kernels in the canonical HSIC. The power of the RHSIC measure scales favourably with the number of samples, and it approximates HSIC and the sensitivity maps efficiently. Convergence bounds of both the measure and the sensitivity map are also provided. Our proposal is illustrated in synthetic examples, and challenging real problems of dependence estimation, feature selection, and causal inference from empirical data."}
{"text": "Semi-supervised and unsupervised systems provide operators with invaluable support and can tremendously reduce the operators load. In the light of the necessity to process large volumes of video data and provide autonomous decisions, this work proposes new learning algorithms for activity analysis in video. The activities and behaviours are described by a dynamic topic model. Two novel learning algorithms based on the expectation maximisation approach and variational Bayes inference are proposed. Theoretical derivations of the posterior of model parameters are given. The designed learning algorithms are compared with the Gibbs sampling inference scheme introduced earlier in the literature. A detailed comparison of the learning algorithms is presented on real video data. We also propose an anomaly localisation procedure, elegantly embedded in the topic modeling framework. The proposed framework can be applied to a number of areas, including transportation systems, security and surveillance."}
{"text": "Many machine learning algorithms require precise estimates of covariance matrices. The sample covariance matrix performs poorly in high-dimensional settings, which has stimulated the development of alternative methods, the majority based on factor models and shrinkage. Recent work of Ledoit and Wolf has extended the shrinkage framework to Nonlinear Shrinkage (NLS), a more powerful covariance estimator based on Random Matrix Theory.   Our contribution shows that, contrary to claims in the literature, cross-validation based covariance matrix estimation (CVC) yields comparable performance at strongly reduced complexity and runtime. On two real world data sets, we show that the CVC estimator yields superior results than competing shrinkage and factor based methods."}
{"text": "We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian model for survival analysis. The model is centred on a parametric baseline hazard, and uses a Gaussian process to model variations away from it nonparametrically, as well as dependence on covariates. As opposed to many other methods in survival analysis, our framework does not impose unnecessary constraints in the hazard rate or in the survival function. Furthermore, our model handles left, right and interval censoring mechanisms common in survival analysis. We propose a MCMC algorithm to perform inference and an approximation scheme based on random Fourier features to make computations faster. We report experimental results on synthetic and real data, showing that our model performs better than competing models such as Cox proportional hazards, ANOVA-DDP and random survival forests."}
{"text": "Tensor decomposition is an important technique for capturing the high-order interactions among multiway data. Multi-linear tensor composition methods, such as the Tucker decomposition and the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), assume that the complex interactions among objects are multi-linear, and are thus insufficient to represent nonlinear relationships in data. Another assumption of these methods is that a predefined rank should be known. However, the rank of tensors is hard to estimate, especially for cases with missing values. To address these issues, we design a Bayesian generative model for tensor decomposition. Different from the traditional Bayesian methods, the high-order interactions of tensor entries are modeled with variational auto-encoder. The proposed model takes advantages of Neural Networks and nonparametric Bayesian models, by replacing the multi-linear product in traditional Bayesian tensor decomposition with a complex nonlinear function (via Neural Networks) whose parameters can be learned from data. Experimental results on synthetic data and real-world chemometrics tensor data have demonstrated that our new model can achieve significantly higher prediction performance than the state-of-the-art tensor decomposition approaches."}
{"text": "In this article, we study spectral methods for community detection based on $ \\alpha$-parametrized normalized modularity matrix hereafter called $ {\\bf L}_\\alpha $ in heterogeneous graph models. We show, in a regime where community detection is not asymptotically trivial, that $ {\\bf L}_\\alpha $ can be well approximated by a more tractable random matrix which falls in the family of spiked random matrices. The analysis of this equivalent spiked random matrix allows us to improve spectral methods for community detection and assess their performances in the regime under study. In particular, we prove the existence of an optimal value $ \\alpha_{\\rm opt} $ of the parameter $ \\alpha $ for which the detection of communities is best ensured and we provide an on-line estimation of $ \\alpha_{\\rm opt} $ only based on the knowledge of the graph adjacency matrix. Unlike classical spectral methods for community detection where clustering is performed on the eigenvectors associated with extreme eigenvalues, we show through our theoretical analysis that a regularization should instead be performed on those eigenvectors prior to clustering in heterogeneous graphs. Finally, through a deeper study of the regularized eigenvectors used for clustering, we assess the performances of our new algorithm for community detection. Numerical simulations in the course of the article show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art spectral methods on dense heterogeneous graphs."}

We discuss the upper convergence rates of Tikhonov regularizer under general source condition corresponding to increasing monotone index function.

Further we also address the minimum possible error for any learning algorithm."}
{"text": "Game theory finds nowadays a broad range of applications in engineering and machine learning. However, in a derivative-free, expensive black-box context, very few algorithmic solutions are available to find game equilibria. Here, we propose a novel Gaussian-process based approach for solving games in this context. We follow a classical Bayesian optimization framework, with sequential sampling decisions based on acquisition functions. Two strategies are proposed, based either on the probability of achieving equilibrium or on the Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction paradigm. Practical and numerical aspects are discussed in order to enhance the scalability and reduce computation time. Our approach is evaluated on several synthetic game problems with varying number of players and decision space dimensions. We show that equilibria can be found reliably for a fraction of the cost (in terms of black-box evaluations) compared to classical, derivative-based algorithms. The method is available in the R package GPGame available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=GPGame."}
{"text": "The vision for precision medicine is to use individual patient characteristics to inform a personalized treatment plan that leads to the best healthcare possible for each patient. Mobile technologies have an important role to play in this vision as they offer a means to monitor a patient's health status in real-time and subsequently to deliver interventions if, when, and in the dose that they are needed. Dynamic treatment regimes formalize individualized treatment plans as sequences of decision rules, one per stage of clinical intervention, that map current patient information to a recommended treatment. However, existing methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes are designed for a small number of fixed decision points occurring on a coarse time-scale. We propose a new reinforcement learning method for estimating an optimal treatment regime that is applicable to data collected using mobile technologies in an outpatient setting. The proposed method accommodates an indefinite time horizon and minute-by-minute decision making that are common in mobile health applications. We show the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. The proposed methods are applied to estimate an optimal dynamic treatment regime for controlling blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes."}
{"text": "We investigate if kernel regularization methods can achieve minimax convergence rates over a source condition regularity assumption for the target function. These questions have been considered in past literature, but only under specific assumptions about the decay, typically polynomial, of the spectrum of the the kernel mapping covariance operator. In the perspective of distribution-free results, we investigate this issue under much weaker assumption on the eigenvalue decay, allowing for more complex behavior that can reflect different structure of the data at different scales."}
{"text": "Spectral dimensionality reduction is frequently used to identify low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data. However, learning manifolds, especially from the streaming data, is computationally and memory expensive. In this paper, we argue that a stable manifold can be learned using only a fraction of the stream, and the remaining stream can be mapped to the manifold in a significantly less costly manner. Identifying the transition point at which the manifold is stable is the key step. We present error metrics that allow us to identify the transition point for a given stream by quantitatively assessing the quality of a manifold learned using Isomap. We further propose an efficient mapping algorithm, called S-Isomap, that can be used to map new samples onto the stable manifold. We describe experiments on a variety of data sets that show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy."}
{"text": "It has been proposed that complex populations, such as those that arise in genomics studies, may exhibit dependencies among observations as well as among variables. This gives rise to the challenging problem of analyzing unreplicated high-dimensional data with unknown mean and dependence structures. Matrix-variate approaches that impose various forms of (inverse) covariance sparsity allow flexible dependence structures to be estimated, but cannot directly be applied when the mean and covariance matrices are estimated jointly. We present a practical method utilizing generalized least squares and penalized (inverse) covariance estimation to address this challenge. We establish consistency and obtain rates of convergence for estimating the mean parameters and covariance matrices. The advantages of our approaches are: (i) dependence graphs and covariance structures can be estimated in the presence of unknown mean structure, (ii) the mean structure becomes more efficiently estimated when accounting for the dependence structure among observations; and (iii) inferences about the mean parameters become correctly calibrated. We use simulation studies and analysis of genomic data from a twin study of ulcerative colitis to illustrate the statistical convergence and the performance of our methods in practical settings. Several lines of evidence show that the test statistics for differential gene expression produced by our methods are correctly calibrated and improve power over conventional methods."}
{"text": "The ability to track a moving vehicle is of crucial importance in numerous applications. The task has often been approached by the importance sampling technique of particle filters due to its ability to model non-linear and non-Gaussian dynamics, of which a vehicle travelling on a road network is a good example. Particle filters perform poorly when observations are highly informative. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing particle filters that sample around the most recent observation. The proposal leads to an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy and efficiency over conventional particle filters, especially when observations are infrequent but low-noise."}
{"text": "In this paper we combine two important extensions of ordinary least squares regression: regularization and optimal scaling. Optimal scaling (sometimes also called optimal scoring) has originally been developed for categorical data, and the process finds quantifications for the categories that are optimal for the regression model in the sense that they maximize the multiple correlation. Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types; typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline) functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted to be monotonic, preserving the ordinal information in the data. In addition to optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge regression, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net. The resulting method will be called ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the basic OS algorithm provides straightforward and efficient estimation of the regularized regression coefficients, automatically gives the Group Lasso and Blockwise Sparse Regression, and extends them with monotonicity properties. We will show that Optimal Scaling linearizes nonlinear relationships between predictors and outcome, and improves upon the condition of the predictor correlation matrix, increasing (on average) the conditional independence of the predictors. Alternative options for regularization of either regression coefficients or category quantifications are mentioned. Extended examples are provided.   Keywords: Categorical Data, Optimal Scaling, Conditional Independence, Step Functions, Splines, Monotonic Transformations, Regularization, Lasso, Elastic Net, Group Lasso, Blockwise Sparse Regression."}
{"text": "We propose a method for finding alternate features missing in the Lasso optimal solution. In ordinary Lasso problem, one global optimum is obtained and the resulting features are interpreted as task-relevant features. However, this can overlook possibly relevant features not selected by the Lasso. With the proposed method, we can provide not only the Lasso optimal solution but also possible alternate features to the Lasso solution. We show that such alternate features can be computed efficiently by avoiding redundant computations. We also demonstrate how the proposed method works in the 20 newsgroup data, which shows that reasonable features are found as alternate features."}
{"text": "This work brings together two powerful concepts in Gaussian processes: the variational approach to sparse approximation and the spectral representation of Gaussian processes. This gives rise to an approximation that inherits the benefits of the variational approach but with the representational power and computational scalability of spectral representations. The work hinges on a key result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances. We derive these expressions for Matern kernels in one dimension, and generalize to more dimensions using kernels with specific structures. Under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise, our method requires only a single pass through the dataset, making for very fast and accurate computation. We fit a model to 4 million training points in just a few minutes on a standard laptop. With non-conjugate likelihoods, our MCMC scheme reduces the cost of computation from O(NM2) (for a sparse Gaussian process) to O(NM) per iteration, where N is the number of data and M is the number of features."}
{"text": "Over the years, ensemble methods have become a staple of machine learning. Similarly, generalized linear models (GLMs) have become very popular for a wide variety of statistical inference tasks. The former have been shown to enhance out- of-sample predictive power and the latter possess easy interpretability. Recently, ensembles of GLMs have been proposed as a possibility. On the downside, this approach loses the interpretability that GLMs possess. We show that minimum description length (MDL)-motivated compression of the inferred ensembles can be used to recover interpretability without much, if any, downside to performance and illustrate on a number of standard classification data sets."}
{"text": "There is a widespread need for techniques that can discover structure from time series data. Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to find structure within a single time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of temporal patterns, it is difficult to extend and can be brittle in practice. This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii) represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in Venture. The paper demonstrates an application to time series clustering that involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over both non-parametric and standard regression baselines."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimating the expected value of information (the knowledge gradient) for Bayesian learning problems where the belief model is nonlinear in the parameters. Our goal is to maximize some metric, while simultaneously learning the unknown parameters of the nonlinear belief model, by guiding a sequential experimentation process which is expensive. We overcome the problem of computing the expected value of an experiment, which is computationally intractable, by using a sampled approximation, which helps to guide experiments but does not provide an accurate estimate of the unknown parameters. We then introduce a resampling process which allows the sampled model to adapt to new information, exploiting past experiments. We show theoretically that the method converges asymptotically to the true parameters, while simultaneously maximizing our metric. We show empirically that the process exhibits rapid convergence, yielding good results with a very small number of experiments."}
{"text": "We present the Wright-Fisher Indian buffet process (WF-IBP), a probabilistic model for time-dependent data assumed to have been generated by an unknown number of latent features. This model is suitable as a prior in Bayesian nonparametric feature allocation models in which the features underlying the observed data exhibit a dependency structure over time. More specifically, we establish a new framework for generating dependent Indian buffet processes, where the Poisson random field model from population genetics is used as a way of constructing dependent beta processes. Inference in the model is complex, and we describe a sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for exact posterior simulation. We apply our construction to develop a nonparametric focused topic model for collections of time-stamped text documents and test it on the full corpus of NIPS papers published from 1987 to 2015."}
{"text": "Decision makers, such as doctors and judges, make crucial decisions such as recommending treatments to patients, and granting bails to defendants on a daily basis. Such decisions typically involve weighting the potential benefits of taking an action against the costs involved. In this work, we aim to automate this task of learning {cost-effective, interpretable and actionable treatment regimes. We formulate this as a problem of learning a decision list -- a sequence of if-then-else rules -- which maps characteristics of subjects (eg., diagnostic test results of patients) to treatments. We propose a novel objective to construct a decision list which maximizes outcomes for the population, and minimizes overall costs. We model the problem of learning such a list as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a variant of the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy which leverages customized checks for pruning the search space effectively. Experimental results on real world observational data capturing treatment recommendations for asthma patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

{"text": "Increasing availability of vehicle GPS data has created potentially transformative opportunities for traffic management, route planning and other location-based services. Critical to the utility of the data is their accuracy. Map-matching is the process of improving the accuracy by aligning GPS data with the road network. In this paper, we propose a purely probabilistic approach to map-matching based on a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm known as particle filters. The approach performs map-matching by producing a range of candidate solutions, each with an associated probability score. We outline implementation details and thoroughly validate the technique on GPS data of varied quality."}
{"text": "The construction of synthetic complex-valued signals from real-valued observations is an important step in many time series analysis techniques. The most widely used approach is based on the Hilbert transform, which maps the real-valued signal into its quadrature component. In this paper, we define a probabilistic generalization of this approach. We model the observable real-valued signal as the real part of a latent complex-valued Gaussian process. In order to obtain the appropriate statistical relationship between its real and imaginary parts, we define two new classes of complex-valued covariance functions. Through an analysis of simulated chirplets and stochastic oscillations, we show that the resulting Gaussian process complex-valued signal provides a better estimate of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency than the established approaches. Furthermore, the complex-valued Gaussian process regression allows to incorporate prior information about the structure in signal and noise and thereby to tailor the analysis to the features of the signal. As a example, we analyze the non-stationary dynamics of brain oscillations in the alpha band, as measured using magneto-encephalography."}
{"text": "In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-dimensional tensor regression problems with low-rank structure. One of the core challenges associated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the underlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations could lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On the other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In this paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees for learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank structural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied to a potentially non-convex constraint set $\\Theta$ in terms of its \\emph{localized Gaussian width}. We juxtapose our theoretical results for non-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on regularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and non-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the non-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has desirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical upper bound perspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of examples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which address these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and convex approaches. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that, under several common settings of generalized low rank tensor regression, the projected gradient descent approach is superior both in terms of statistical error and run-time provided the step-sizes of the projected descent algorithm are suitably chosen."}
{"text": "Variational inference provides a powerful tool for approximate probabilistic in- ference on complex, structured models. Typical variational inference methods, however, require to use inference networks with computationally tractable proba- bility density functions. This largely limits the design and implementation of vari- ational inference methods. We consider wild variational inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the inference networks, and hence can be applied in more challenging cases. As an example of application, we treat stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as an inference network, and use our methods to automatically adjust the step sizes of SGLD, yielding significant improvement over the hand-designed step size schemes"}
{"text": "We aim to create a framework for transfer learning using latent factor models to learn the dependence structure between a larger source dataset and a target dataset. The methodology is motivated by our goal of building a risk-assessment model for surgery patients, using both institutional and national surgical outcomes data. The national surgical outcomes data is collected through NSQIP (National Surgery Quality Improvement Program), a database housing almost 4 million patients from over 700 different hospitals. We build a latent factor model with a hierarchical prior on the loadings matrix to appropriately account for the different covariance structure in our data. We extend this model to handle more complex relationships between the populations by deriving a scale mixture formulation using stick-breaking properties. Our model provides a transfer learning framework that utilizes all information from both the source and target data, while modeling the underlying inherent differences between them."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel approach for parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationships, for which existing techniques exploiting graphical model structure are not applicable. Our approach is motivated by a model of seismic events and signals, where events detected in distant regions are approximately independent given those in intermediate regions. We perform parallel inference by coloring a factor graph defined over regions of latent space, rather than individual model variables. Evaluating on a model of seismic event detection, we achieve significant speedups over serial MCMC with no degradation in inference quality."}
{"text": "Noise injection (NI) is an efficient technique to mitigate over-fitting in neural networks (NNs). The Bernoulli NI procedure as implemented in dropout and shakeout has connections with $l_1$ and $l_2$ regularization for the NN model parameters. We propose whiteout, a family NI regularization techniques (NIRT) through injecting adaptive Gaussian noises during the training of NNs. Whiteout is the first NIRT than imposes a broad range of the $l_{\\gamma}$ sparsity regularization $(\\gamma\\in(0,2))$ without having to involving the $l_2$ regularization. Whiteout can also be extended to offer regularizations similar to the adaptive lasso and group lasso. We establish the regularization effect of whiteout in the framework of generalized linear models with closed-form penalty terms and show that whiteout stabilizes the training of NNs with decreased sensitivity to small perturbations in the input. We establish that the noise-perturbed empirical loss function (pelf) with whiteout converges almost surely to the ideal loss function (ilf), and the minimizer of the pelf is consistent for the minimizer of the ilf. We derive the tail bound on the pelf to establish the practical feasibility in its minimization. The superiority of whiteout over the Bernoulli NIRTs, dropout and shakeout, in learning NNs with relatively small-sized training sets and non-inferiority in large-sized training sets is demonstrated in both simulated and real-life data sets. This work represents the first in-depth theoretical, methodological, and practical examination of the regularization effects of both additive and multiplicative Gaussian NI in deep NNs."}
{"text": "Supervised topic models can help clinical researchers find interpretable cooccurence patterns in count data that are relevant for diagnostics. However, standard formulations of supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation have two problems. First, when documents have many more words than labels, the influence of the labels will be negligible. Second, due to conditional independence assumptions in the graphical model the impact of supervised labels on the learned topic-word probabilities is often minimal, leading to poor predictions on heldout data. We investigate penalized optimization methods for training sLDA that produce interpretable topic-word parameters and useful heldout predictions, using recognition networks to speed-up inference. We report preliminary results on synthetic data and on predicting successful anti-depressant medication given a patient's diagnostic history."}
{"text": "Bagging is a device intended for reducing the prediction error of learning algorithms. In its simplest form, bagging draws bootstrap samples from the training sample, applies the learning algorithm to each bootstrap sample, and then averages the resulting prediction rules.   We extend the definition of bagging from statistics to statistical functionals and study the von Mises expansion of bagged statistical functionals. We show that the expansion is related to the Efron-Stein ANOVA expansion of the raw (unbagged) functional. The basic observation is that a bagged functional is always smooth in the sense that the von Mises expansion exists and is finite of length 1 + resample size $M$. This holds even if the raw functional is rough or unstable. The resample size $M$ acts as a smoothing parameter, where a smaller $M$ means more smoothing."}
{"text": "We focus on the maximum regularization parameter for anisotropic total-variation denoising. It corresponds to the minimum value of the regularization parameter above which the solution remains constant. While this value is well know for the Lasso, such a critical value has not been investigated in details for the total-variation. Though, it is of importance when tuning the regularization parameter as it allows fixing an upper-bound on the grid for which the optimal parameter is sought. We establish a closed form expression for the one-dimensional case, as well as an upper-bound for the two-dimensional case, that appears reasonably tight in practice. This problem is directly linked to the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the divergence, which can be quickly obtained by performing convolutions in the Fourier domain."}
{"text": "This paper presents an algorithm for the unsupervised learning of latent variable models from unlabeled sets of data. We base our technique on spectral decomposition, providing a technique that proves to be robust both in theory and in practice. We also describe how to use this algorithm to learn the parameters of two well known text mining models: single topic model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, providing in both cases an efficient technique to retrieve the parameters to feed the algorithm. We compare the results of our algorithm with those of existing algorithms on synthetic data, and we provide examples of applications to real world text corpora for both single topic model and LDA, obtaining meaningful results."}
{"text": "The stochastic variational inference (SVI) paradigm, which combines variational inference, natural gradients, and stochastic updates, was recently proposed for large-scale data analysis in conjugate Bayesian models and demonstrated to be effective in several problems. This paper studies a family of Bayesian latent variable models with two levels of hidden variables but without any conjugacy requirements, making several contributions in this context. The first is observing that SVI, with an improved structured variational approximation, is applicable under more general conditions than previously thought with the only requirement being that the approximating variational distribution be in the same family as the prior. The resulting approach, Monte Carlo Structured SVI (MC-SSVI), significantly extends the scope of SVI, enabling large-scale learning in non-conjugate models. For models with latent Gaussian variables we propose a hybrid algorithm, using both standard and natural gradients, which is shown to improve stability and convergence. Applications in mixed effects models, sparse Gaussian processes, probabilistic matrix factorization and correlated topic models demonstrate the generality of the approach and the advantages of the proposed algorithms."}
{"text": "Spectral analysis of neighborhood graphs is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data analysis, with applications ranging from machine learning to social sciences. In such applications, it is typical to first encode relationships between the data samples using an appropriate similarity function. Popular neighborhood construction techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are known to be very sensitive to the choice of parameters, and more importantly susceptible to noise and varying densities. In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of the local scales. In addition to being highly resilient to noise or outlying data, the proposed approach does not require extensive parameter tuning unlike several existing methods. Using applications in spectral clustering and single-example label propagation, we show that the proposed neighborhood graphs outperform existing locally scaled graph construction approaches."}
{"text": "Many popular network models rely on the assumption of (vertex) exchangeability, in which the distribution of the graph is invariant to relabelings of the vertices. However, the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or empty with probability one, whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure."}
{"text": "This paper frames causal structure estimation as a machine learning task. The idea is to treat indicators of causal relationships between variables as `labels' and to exploit available data on the variables of interest to provide features for the labelling task. Background scientific knowledge or any available interventional data provide labels on some causal relationships and the remainder are treated as unlabelled. To illustrate the key ideas, we develop a distance-based approach (based on bivariate histograms) within a manifold regularization framework. We present empirical results on three different biological data sets (including examples where causal effects can be verified by experimental intervention), that together demonstrate the efficacy and general nature of the approach as well as its simplicity from a user's point of view."}
{"text": "Tuning parameter selection is of critical importance for kernel ridge regression. To this date, data driven tuning method for divide-and-conquer kernel ridge regression (d-KRR) has been lacking in the literature, which limits the applicability of d-KRR for large data sets. In this paper, by modifying the Generalized Cross-validation (GCV, Wahba, 1990) score, we propose a distributed Generalized Cross-Validation (dGCV) as a data-driven tool for selecting the tuning parameters in d-KRR. Not only the proposed dGCV is computationally scalable for massive data sets, it is also shown, under mild conditions, to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that minimizing the dGCV score is equivalent to minimizing the true global conditional empirical loss of the averaged function estimator, extending the existing optimality results of GCV to the divide-and-conquer framework."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel multivariate random process producing Bernoulli outputs per dimension, that can possibly formalize binary interactions in various graphical structures and can be used to model opinion dynamics, epidemics, financial and biological time series data, etc. We call this a Bernoulli Autoregressive Process (BAR). A BAR process models a discrete-time vector random sequence of $p$ scalar Bernoulli processes with autoregressive dynamics and corresponds to a particular Markov Chain. The benefit from the autoregressive dynamics is the description of a $2^p\\times 2^p$ transition matrix by at most $pd$ effective parameters for some $d\\ll p$ or by two sparse matrices of dimensions $p\\times p^2$ and $p\\times p$, respectively, parameterizing the transitions. Additionally, we show that the BAR process mixes rapidly, by proving that the mixing time is $O(\\log p)$. The hidden constant in the previous mixing time bound depends explicitly on the values of the chain parameters and implicitly on the maximum allowed in-degree of a node in the corresponding graph. For a network with $p$ nodes, where each node has in-degree at most $d$ and corresponds to a scalar Bernoulli process generated by a BAR, we provide a greedy algorithm that can efficiently learn the structure of the underlying directed graph with a sample complexity proportional to the mixing time of the BAR process. The sample complexity of the proposed algorithm is nearly order-optimal as it is only a $\\log p$ factor away from an information-theoretic lower bound. We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our algorithm in various setups, including a model for a biological signaling network."}
{"text": "In typical applications of Bayesian optimization, minimal assumptions are made about the objective function being optimized. This is true even when researchers have prior information about the shape of the function with respect to one or more argument. We make the case that shape constraints are often appropriate in at least two important application areas of Bayesian optimization: (1) hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms and (2) decision analysis with utility functions. We describe a methodology for incorporating a variety of shape constraints within the usual Bayesian optimization framework and present positive results from simple applications which suggest that Bayesian optimization with shape constraints is a promising topic for further research."}
{"text": "We provide a way to infer about existence of topological circularity in high-dimensional data sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ from its projection in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ obtained through a fast manifold learning map as a function of the high-dimensional dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ and a particular choice of a positive real $\\sigma$ known as bandwidth parameter. At the same time we also provide a way to estimate the optimal bandwidth for fast manifold learning in this setting through minimization of these functions of bandwidth. We also provide limit theorems to characterize the behavior of our proposed functions of bandwidth."}
{"text": "We propose communication-efficient distributed estimation and inference methods for the transelliptical graphical model, a semiparametric extension of the elliptical distribution in the high dimensional regime. In detail, the proposed method distributes the $d$-dimensional data of size $N$ generated from a transelliptical graphical model into $m$ worker machines, and estimates the latent precision matrix on each worker machine based on the data of size $n=N/m$. It then debiases the local estimators on the worker machines and send them back to the master machine. Finally, on the master machine, it aggregates the debiased local estimators by averaging and hard thresholding. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimator based on all the data, provided that the number of machines satisfies $m \\lesssim \\min\\{N\\log d/d,\\sqrt{N/(s^2\\log d)}\\}$, where $s$ is the maximum number of nonzero entries in each column of the latent precision matrix. It is worth noting that our algorithm and theory can be directly applied to Gaussian graphical models, Gaussian copula graphical models and elliptical graphical models, since they are all special cases of transelliptical graphical models. Thorough experiments on synthetic data back up our theory."}
{"text": "Joint blind source separation (J-BSS) is an emerging data-driven technique for multi-set data-fusion. In this paper, J-BSS is addressed from a tensorial perspective. We show how, by using second-order multi-set statistics in J-BSS, a specific double coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (DC-CPD) problem can be formulated. We propose an algebraic DC-CPD algorithm based on a coupled rank-1 detection mapping. This algorithm converts a possibly underdetermined DC-CPD to a set of overdetermined CPDs. The latter can be solved algebraically via a generalized eigenvalue decomposition based scheme. Therefore, this algorithm is deterministic and returns the exact solution in the noiseless case. In the noisy case, it can be used to effectively initialize optimization based DC-CPD algorithms. In addition, we obtain the determini- stic and generic uniqueness conditions for DC-CPD, which are shown to be more relaxed than their CPD counterpart. Experiment results are given to illustrate the superiority of DC-CPD over standard CPD based BSS methods and several existing J-BSS methods, with regards to uniqueness and accuracy."}
{"text": "Personalized treatment of patients based on tissue-specific cancer subtypes has strongly increased the efficacy of the chosen therapies. Even though the amount of data measured for cancer patients has increased over the last years, most cancer subtypes are still diagnosed based on individual data sources (e.g. gene expression data). We propose an unsupervised data integration method based on kernel principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in data analysis. Unfortunately, the straight-forward multiple-kernel extension of this method leads to the use of only one of the input matrices, which does not fit the goal of gaining information from all data sources. Therefore, we present a scoring function to determine the impact of each input matrix. The approach enables visualizing the integrated data and subsequent clustering for cancer subtype identification. Due to the nature of the method, no free parameters have to be set. We apply the methodology to five different cancer data sets and demonstrate its advantages in terms of results and usability."}
{"text": "We study the problem of estimating low-rank matrices from linear measurements (a.k.a., matrix sensing) through nonconvex optimization. We propose an efficient stochastic variance reduced gradient descent algorithm to solve a nonconvex optimization problem of matrix sensing. Our algorithm is applicable to both noisy and noiseless settings. In the case with noisy observations, we prove that our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate up to the minimax optimal statistical error. And in the noiseless setting, our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix and achieves exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. Most notably, the overall computational complexity of our proposed algorithm, which is defined as the iteration complexity times per iteration time complexity, is lower than the state-of-the-art algorithms based on gradient descent. Experiments on synthetic data corroborate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms."}
{"text": "Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of non-linear systems from experimental datasets. Recently, several attempts have extended DMD to the context of low-rank approximations. This extension is of particular interest for reduced-order modeling in various applicative domains, e.g. for climate prediction, to study molecular dynamics or micro-electromechanical devices. This low-rank extension takes the form of a non-convex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, only sub-optimal algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute the solution of this problem. In this paper, we prove that there exists a closed-form optimal solution to this problem and design an effective algorithm to compute it based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A toy-example illustrates the gain in performance of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art techniques."}
{"text": "This workshop explores the interface between cognitive neuroscience and recent advances in AI fields that aim to reproduce human performance such as natural language processing and computer vision, and specifically deep learning approaches to such problems.   When studying the cognitive capabilities of the brain, scientists follow a system identification approach in which they present different stimuli to the subjects and try to model the response that different brain areas have of that stimulus. The goal is to understand the brain by trying to find the function that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of the stimulus. Experimental stimuli are becoming increasingly complex with more and more people being interested in studying real life phenomena such as the perception of natural images or natural sentences. There is therefore a need for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the stimulus, that we can obtain using advances in machine learning.   In parallel, new ML approaches, many of which in deep learning, are inspired to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently, processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings about brain function, and it is unclear whether it is at all beneficial for machine learning to try to emulate brain function in order to achieve the same tasks that the brain achieves."}
{"text": "Recent years have seen an increasing popularity of learning the sparse \\emph{changes} in Markov Networks. Changes in the structure of Markov Networks reflect alternations of interactions between random variables under different regimes and provide insights into the underlying system. While each individual network structure can be complicated and difficult to learn, the overall change from one network to another can be simple. This intuition gave birth to an approach that \\emph{directly} learns the sparse changes without modelling and learning the individual (possibly dense) networks. In this paper, we review such a direct learning method with some latest developments along this line of research."}
{"text": "Gaussian graphical model is a graphical representation of the dependence structure for a Gaussian random vector. It is recognized as a powerful tool in different applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech language, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection is a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample of a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection are suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family of individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach leads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical procedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic of these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing literature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect edge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also important to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type II error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection problem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of statistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses. Additive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We construct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine them to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure. We show that the obtained procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the linear combination of expected numbers of Type I and Type II errors in the class of unbiased multiple decision procedures."}
{"text": "We propose a generic framework based on a new stochastic variance-reduced gradient descent algorithm for accelerating nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery. Starting from an appropriate initial estimator, our proposed algorithm performs projected gradient descent based on a novel semi-stochastic gradient specifically designed for low-rank matrix recovery. Based upon the mild restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions, we derive a projected notion of the restricted Lipschitz continuous gradient property, and prove that our algorithm enjoys linear convergence rate to the unknown low-rank matrix with an improved computational complexity. Moreover, our algorithm can be employed to both noiseless and noisy observations, where the optimal sample complexity and the minimax optimal statistical rate can be attained respectively. We further illustrate the superiority of our generic framework through several specific examples, both theoretically and experimentally."}
{"text": "In this article, a large dimensional performance analysis of kernel least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is provided under the assumption of a two-class Gaussian mixture model for the input data. Building upon recent advances in random matrix theory, we show, when the dimension of data $p$ and their number $n$ are both large, that the LS-SVM decision function can be well approximated by a normally distributed random variable, the mean and variance of which depend explicitly on a local behavior of the kernel function. This theoretical result is then applied to the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets which, despite their non-Gaussianity, exhibit a convincingly close behavior. Most importantly, our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism into play in SVM-type methods and in particular of the impact on the choice of the kernel function as well as some of their theoretical limits in separating high dimensional Gaussian vectors."}
{"text": "More and more processes governing our lives use in some part an automatic decision step, where -- based on a feature vector derived from an applicant -- an algorithm has the decision power over the final outcome. Here we present a simple idea which gives some of the power back to the applicant by providing her with alternatives which would make the decision algorithm decide differently. It is based on a formalization reminiscent of methods used for evasion attacks, and consists in enumerating the subspaces where the classifiers decides the desired output. This has been implemented for the specific case of decision forests (ensemble methods based on decision trees), mapping the problem to an iterative version of enumerating $k$-cliques."}
{"text": "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a multivariate statistical technique for finding the linear relationship between two sets of variables. The kernel generalization of CCA named kernel CCA has been proposed to find nonlinear relations between datasets. Despite their wide usage, they have one common limitation that is the lack of sparsity in their solution. In this paper, we consider sparse kernel CCA and propose a novel sparse kernel CCA algorithm (SKCCA). Our algorithm is based on a relationship between kernel CCA and least squares. Sparsity of the dual transformations is introduced by penalizing the $\\ell_{1}$-norm of dual vectors. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm not only performs well in computing sparse dual transformations but also can alleviate the over-fitting problem of kernel CCA."}
{"text": "Regression models are increasingly built using datasets which do not follow a design of experiment. Instead, the data is e.g. gathered by an automated monitoring of a technical system. As a consequence, already the input data represents phenomena of the system and violates statistical assumptions of distributions. The input data can show correlations, clusters or other patterns. Further, the distribution of input data influences the reliability of regression models. We propose criteria to quantify typical phenomena of input data for regression and show their suitability with simulated benchmark datasets.   -----   Regressionen werden zunehmend auf Datens\\\"atzen angewendet, deren Eingangsvektoren nicht durch eine statistische Versuchsplanung festgelegt wurden.

{"text": "Gaussian processes (GPs) have been proven to be powerful tools in various areas of machine learning. However, there are very few applications of GPs in the scenario of multi-view learning. In this paper, we present a new GP model for multi-view learning. Unlike existing methods, it combines multiple views by regularizing marginal likelihood with the consistency among the posterior distributions of latent functions from different views. Moreover, we give a general point selection scheme for multi-view learning and improve the proposed model by this criterion. Experimental results on multiple real world data sets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model and witnessed the performance improvement through employing this novel point selection scheme."}
{"text": "Random forest (RF) missing data algorithms are an attractive approach for dealing with missing data. They have the desirable properties of being able to handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings. Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms but relatively little guidance about their efficacy, which motivated us to study their performance. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting---the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Performance of algorithms was assessed by ability to impute data accurately. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing not at random."}
{"text": "Estimation of individual treatment effect in observational data is complicated due to the challenges of confounding and selection bias. A useful inferential framework to address this is the counterfactual (potential outcomes) model which takes the hypothetical stance of asking what if an individual had received both treatments. Making use of random forests (RF) within the counterfactual framework we estimate individual treatment effects by directly modeling the response. We find accurate estimation of individual treatment effects is possible even in complex heterogeneous settings but that the type of RF approach plays an important role in accuracy. Methods designed to be adaptive to confounding, when used in parallel with out-of-sample estimation, do best. One method found to be especially promising is counterfactual synthetic forests. We illustrate this new methodology by applying it to a large comparative effectiveness trial, Project Aware, in order to explore the role drug use plays in sexual risk. The analysis reveals important connections between risky behavior, drug usage, and sexual risk."}
{"text": "Stability is an important aspect of a classification procedure because unstable predictions can potentially reduce users' trust in a classification system and also harm the reproducibility of scientific conclusions. The major goal of our work is to introduce a novel concept of classification instability, i.e., decision boundary instability (DBI), and incorporate it with the generalization error (GE) as a standard for selecting the most accurate and stable classifier. Specifically, we implement a two-stage algorithm: (i) initially select a subset of classifiers whose estimated GEs are not significantly different from the minimal estimated GE among all the candidate classifiers; (ii) the optimal classifier is chosen as the one achieving the minimal DBI among the subset selected in stage (i). This general selection principle applies to both linear and nonlinear classifiers. Large-margin classifiers are used as a prototypical example to illustrate the above idea. Our selection method is shown to be consistent in the sense that the optimal classifier simultaneously achieves the minimal GE and the minimal DBI. Various simulations and real examples further demonstrate the advantage of our method over several alternative approaches."}
{"text": "Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified."}
{"text": "We consider the demixing problem of two (or more) high-dimensional vectors from nonlinear observations when the number of such observations is far less than the ambient dimension of the underlying vectors. Specifically, we demonstrate an algorithm that stably estimate the underlying components under general \\emph{structured sparsity} assumptions on these components. Specifically, we show that for certain types of structured superposition models, our method provably recovers the components given merely $n = \\mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$ denotes the number of nonzero entries in the underlying components. Moreover, our method achieves a fast (linear) convergence rate, and also exhibits fast (near-linear) per-iteration complexity for certain types of structured models. We also provide a range of simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm."}
{"text": "Random sinusoidal features are a popular approach for speeding up kernel-based inference in large datasets. Prior to the inference stage, the approach suggests performing dimensionality reduction by first multiplying each data vector by a random Gaussian matrix, and then computing an element-wise sinusoid. Theoretical analysis shows that collecting a sufficient number of such features can be reliably used for subsequent inference in kernel classification and regression.   In this work, we demonstrate that with a mild increase in the dimension of the embedding, it is also possible to reconstruct the data vector from such random sinusoidal features, provided that the underlying data is sparse enough. In particular, we propose a numerically stable algorithm for reconstructing the data vector given the nonlinear features, and analyze its sample complexity. Our algorithm can be extended to other types of structured inverse problems, such as demixing a pair of sparse (but incoherent) vectors. We support the efficacy of our approach via numerical experiments."}
{"text": "Heavy-tailed distributions are widely used in robust mixture modelling due to possessing thick tails. As a computationally tractable subclass of the stable distributions, sub-Gaussian $\\alpha$-stable distribution received much interest in the literature. Here, we introduce a type of expectation maximization algorithm that estimates parameters of a mixture of sub-Gaussian stable distributions. A comparative study, in the presence of some well-known mixture models, is performed to show the robustness and performance of the mixture of sub-Gaussian $\\alpha$-stable distributions for modelling, simulated, synthetic, and real data."}
{"text": "Subset selection in multiple linear regression aims to choose a subset of candidate explanatory variables that tradeoff fitting error (explanatory power) and model complexity (number of variables selected). We build mathematical programming models for regression subset selection based on mean square and absolute errors, and minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criteria. The proposed models are tested using a linear-program-based branch-and-bound algorithm with tailored valid inequalities and big M values and are compared against the algorithms in the literature. For high dimensional cases, an iterative heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the mathematical programming models and a core set concept, and a randomized version of the algorithm is derived to guarantee convergence to the global optimum. From the computational experiments, we find that our models quickly find a quality solution while the rest of the time is spent to prove optimality; the iterative algorithms find solutions in a relatively short time and are competitive compared to state-of-the-art algorithms; using ad-hoc big M values is not recommended."}
{"text": "Given functional data from a survival process with time-dependent covariates, we derive a smooth convex representation for its nonparametric log-likelihood functional and obtain its functional gradient. From this we devise a generic gradient boosting procedure for estimating the hazard function nonparametrically. An illustrative implementation of the procedure using regression trees is described to show how to recover the unknown hazard. We show that the generic estimator is consistent if the model is correctly specified; alternatively an oracle inequality can be demonstrated for tree-based models. To avoid overfitting, boosting employs several regularization devices. One of them is step-size restriction, but the rationale for this is somewhat mysterious from the viewpoint of consistency. Our work brings some clarity to this issue by revealing that step-size restriction is a mechanism for preventing the curvature of the risk from derailing convergence."}
{"text": "Prototypal analysis is introduced to overcome two shortcomings of archetypal analysis: its sensitivity to outliers and its non-locality, which reduces its applicability as a learning tool. Same as archetypal analysis, prototypal analysis finds prototypes through convex combination of the data points and approximates the data through convex combination of the archetypes, but it adds a penalty for using prototypes distant from the data points for their reconstruction. Prototypal analysis can be extended---via kernel embedding---to probability distributions, since the convexity of the prototypes makes them interpretable as mixtures. Finally, prototypal regression is developed, a robust supervised procedure which allows the use of distributions as either features or labels."}
{"text": "Forward regression is a statistical model selection and estimation procedure which inductively selects covariates that add predictive power into a working statistical regression model. Once a model is selected, unknown regression parameters are estimated by least squares. This paper analyzes forward regression in high-dimensional sparse linear models. Probabilistic bounds for prediction error norm and number of selected covariates are proved. The analysis in this paper gives sharp rates and does not require beta-min or irrepresentability conditions."}
{"text": "This paper presents a novel data-driven technique based on the spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) for energy/power prediction for complex dynamical systems. Built on symbolic dynamic filtering, the STPN framework is used to capture not only the individual system characteristics but also the pair-wise causal dependencies among different sub-systems. For quantifying the causal dependency, a mutual information based metric is presented. An energy prediction approach is subsequently proposed based on the STPN framework. For validating the proposed scheme, two case studies are presented, one involving wind turbine power prediction (supply side energy) using the Western Wind Integration data set generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics, and the other, residential electric energy disaggregation (demand side energy) using the Building America 2010 data set from NREL for exploring the temporal features. In the energy disaggregation context, convex programming techniques beyond the STPN framework are developed and applied to achieve improved disaggregation performance."}
{"text": "A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.   In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and other heuristics for posterior estimation."}
{"text": "Consumer Demand Response (DR) is an important research and industry problem, which seeks to categorize, predict and modify consumer's energy consumption. Unfortunately, traditional clustering methods have resulted in many hundreds of clusters, with a given consumer often associated with several clusters, making it difficult to classify consumers into stable representative groups and to predict individual energy consumption patterns. In this paper, we present a shape-based approach that better classifies and predicts consumer energy consumption behavior at the household level. The method is based on Dynamic Time Warping. DTW seeks an optimal alignment between energy consumption patterns reflecting the effect of hidden patterns of regular consumer behavior. Using real consumer 24-hour load curves from Opower Corporation, our method results in a 50% reduction in the number of representative groups and an improvement in prediction accuracy measured under DTW distance. We extend the approach to estimate which electrical devices will be used and in which hours."}
{"text": "This paper proposes a hierarchical feature extractor for non-stationary streaming time series based on the concept of switching observable Markov chain models. The slow time-scale non-stationary behaviors are considered to be a mixture of quasi-stationary fast time-scale segments that are exhibited by complex dynamical systems. The idea is to model each unique stationary characteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique characteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one low-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in the recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build an online algorithm suited for handling quasi-stationary data at a lower level and a non-stationary behavior at a higher level without a priori knowledge. A key observation made in this study is that the rate of change of data likelihood seems to be a better indicator of change in data characteristics compared to the traditional methods that mostly consider data likelihood for change detection. The algorithm minimizes model complexity and captures data likelihood. Efficacy demonstration and comparative evaluation of the proposed algorithm are performed using time series data simulated from systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. We discuss results that show that the proposed hierarchical SDF algorithm can identify underlying features with significantly high degree of accuracy, even under very noisy conditions. Algorithm is demonstrated to perform better than the baseline Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The low computational complexity of algorithm makes it suitable for on-board, real time operations."}
{"text": "In this work a robust clustering algorithm for stationary time series is proposed. The algorithm is based on the use of estimated spectral densities, which are considered as functional data, as the basic characteristic of stationary time series for clustering purposes. A robust algorithm for functional data is then applied to the set of spectral densities. Trimming techniques and restrictions on the scatter within groups reduce the effect of noise in the data and help to prevent the identification of spurious clusters. The procedure is tested in a simulation study, and is also applied to a real data set."}
{"text": "We propose a framework for modeling and estimating the state of controlled dynamical systems, where an agent can affect the system through actions and receives partial observations. Based on this framework, we propose the Predictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFFPSR). A key property in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditional distribution of future observations given future actions. RFF-PSRs combine this representation with moment-matching, kernel embedding and local optimization to achieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can represent controlled environments which can be affected by actions; it has an efficient and theoretically justified learning algorithm; it uses a non-parametric representation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-linear dynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method."}
{"text": "As data collections become larger, exploratory regression analysis becomes more important but more challenging. When observations are hierarchically clustered the problem is even more challenging because model selection with mixed effect models can produce misleading results when nonlinear effects are not included into the model (Bauer and Cai, 2009). A machine learning method called boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001) is a good approach for exploratory regression analysis in real data sets because it can detect predictors with nonlinear and interaction effects while also accounting for missing data. We propose an extension to boosted decision decision trees called metboost for hierarchically clustered data. It works by constraining the structure of each tree to be the same across groups, but allowing the terminal node means to differ. This allows predictors and split points to lead to different predictions within each group, and approximates nonlinear group specific effects. Importantly, metboost remains computationally feasible for thousands of observations and hundreds of predictors that may contain missing values. We apply the method to predict math performance for 15,240 students from 751 schools in data collected in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002 (Ingels et al., 2007), allowing 76 predictors to have unique effects for each school. When comparing results to boosted decision trees, metboost has 15% improved prediction performance. Results of a large simulation study show that metboost has up to 70% improved variable selection performance and up to 30% improved prediction performance compared to boosted decision trees when group sizes are small"}
{"text": "Statistical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) allows researchers to study local climate change effects decades into the future. A wide range of statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in machine learning have not been explored. In this paper, we compare four fundamental statistical methods, Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD), Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine, with three more advanced machine learning methods, Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning (MSSL), BCSD coupled with MSSL, and Convolutional Neural Networks to downscale daily precipitation in the Northeast United States. Metrics to evaluate of each method's ability to capture daily anomalies, large scale climate shifts, and extremes are analyzed. We find that linear methods, led by BCSD, consistently outperform non-linear approaches. The direct application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches."}
{"text": "Flow cytometry is a high-throughput technology used to quantify multiple surface and intracellular markers at the level of a single cell. This enables to identify cell sub-types, and to determine their relative proportions. Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells from a blood sample using multiple markers. This results in high-dimensional datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent (e.g. longitudinal studies). Here, we propose to use a Bayesian nonparametric approach with Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of multivariate skew $t$-distributions to perform model based clustering of flow-cytometry data. DPM models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding model selection issues, and skew $t$-distributions provides robustness to outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the DALIA-1 data. We have made the method available for the community in the R package NPflow."}
{"text": "Many modern data sets are sampled with error from complex high-dimensional surfaces. Methods such as tensor product splines or Gaussian processes are effective/well suited for characterizing a surface in two or three dimensions but may suffer from difficulties when representing higher dimensional surfaces. Motivated by high throughput toxicity testing where observed dose-response curves are cross sections of a surface defined by a chemical's structural properties, a model is developed to characterize this surface to predict untested chemicals' dose-responses. This manuscript proposes a novel approach that models the multidimensional surface as a sum of learned basis functions formed as the tensor product of lower dimensional functions, which are themselves representable by a basis expansion learned from the data. The model is described, a Gibbs sampling algorithm proposed, and is investigated in a simulation study as well as data taken from the US EPA's ToxCast high throughput toxicity testing platform."}
{"text": "We study additive models built with trend filtering, i.e., additive models whose components are each regularized by the (discrete) total variation of their $k$th (discrete) derivative, for a chosen integer $k \\geq 0$. This results in $k$th degree piecewise polynomial components, (e.g., $k=0$ gives piecewise constant components, $k=1$ gives piecewise linear, $k=2$ gives piecewise quadratic, etc.). Analogous to its advantages in the univariate case, additive trend filtering has favorable theoretical and computational properties, thanks in large part to the localized nature of the (discrete) total variation regularizer that it uses. On the theory side, we derive fast error rates for additive trend filtering estimates, and show these rates are minimax optimal when the underlying function is additive and has component functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation. We also show that these rates are unattainable by additive smoothing splines (and by additive models built from linear smoothers, in general). On the computational side, as per the standard in additive models, backfitting is an appealing method for optimization, but it is particularly appealing for additive trend filtering because we can leverage a few highly efficient univariate trend filtering solvers. Going one step further, we describe a new backfitting algorithm whose iterations can be run in parallel, which (as far as we know) is the first of its kind. Lastly, we present experiments to examine the empirical performance of additive trend filtering."}
{"text": "Estimating the state of a dynamical system from a series of noise-corrupted observations is fundamental in many areas of science and engineering. The most well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. Finally, we empirically validate our approach via the analysis of measured brain signals."}
{"text": "This paper introduces a method for efficiently inferring a high-dimensional distributed quantity from a few observations. The quantity of interest (QoI) is approximated in a basis (dictionary) learned from a training set. The coefficients associated with the approximation of the QoI in the basis are determined by minimizing the misfit with the observations. To obtain a probabilistic estimate of the quantity of interest, a Bayesian approach is employed. The QoI is treated as a random field endowed with a hierarchical prior distribution so that closed-form expressions can be obtained for the posterior distribution. The main contribution of the present work lies in the derivation of \\emph{a representation basis consistent with the observation chain} used to infer the associated coefficients. The resulting dictionary is then tailored to be both observable by the sensors and accurate in approximating the posterior mean. An algorithm for deriving such an observable dictionary is presented. The method is illustrated with the estimation of the velocity field of an open cavity flow from a handful of wall-mounted point sensors. Comparison with standard estimation approaches relying on Principal Component Analysis and K-SVD dictionaries is provided and illustrates the superior performance of the present approach."}
{"text": "SAGA is a fast incremental gradient method on the finite sum problem and its effectiveness has been tested on a vast of applications. In this paper, we analyze SAGA on a class of non-strongly convex and non-convex statistical problem such as Lasso, group Lasso, Logistic regression with $\\ell_1$ regularization, linear regression with SCAD regularization and Correct Lasso. We prove that SAGA enjoys the linear convergence rate up to the statistical estimation accuracy, under the assumption of restricted strong convexity (RSC). It significantly extends the applicability of SAGA in convex and non-convex optimization."}
{"text": "Background: Statistical mechanics results (Dauphin et al. (2014); Choromanska et al. (2015)) suggest that local minima with high error are exponentially rare in high dimensions. However, to prove low error guarantees for Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs), previous works so far required either a heavily modified MNN model or training method, strong assumptions on the labels (e.g., \"near\" linear separability), or an unrealistic hidden layer with $\\Omega\\left(N\\right)$ units.   Results: We examine a MNN with one hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a single output, and a quadratic loss. We prove that, with high probability in the limit of $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ datapoints, the volume of differentiable regions of the empiric loss containing sub-optimal differentiable local minima is exponentially vanishing in comparison with the same volume of global minima, given standard normal input of dimension $d_{0}=\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\sqrt{N}\\right)$, and a more realistic number of $d_{1}=\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(N/d_{0}\\right)$ hidden units. We demonstrate our results numerically: for example, $0\\%$ binary classification training error on CIFAR with only $N/d_{0}\\approx 16$ hidden neurons."}
{"text": "Hypothesis tests in models whose dimension far exceeds the sample size can be formulated much like the classical studentized tests only after the initial bias of estimation is removed successfully. The theory of debiased estimators can be developed in the context of quantile regression models for a fixed quantile value. However, it is frequently desirable to formulate tests based on the quantile regression process, as this leads to more robust tests and more stable confidence sets. Additionally, inference in quantile regression requires estimation of the so called sparsity function, which depends on the unknown density of the error. In this paper we consider a debiasing approach for the uniform testing problem. We develop high-dimensional regression rank scores and show how to use them to estimate the sparsity function, as well as how to adapt them for inference involving the quantile regression process. Furthermore, we develop a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in a location-shift high-dimensional models and confidence sets that are uniformly valid for many quantile values. The main technical result are the development of a Bahadur representation of the debiasing estimator that is uniform over a range of quantiles and uniform convergence of the quantile process to the Brownian bridge process, which are of independent interest. Simulation studies illustrate finite sample properties of our procedure."}
{"text": "Many statistical learning problems can be posed as minimization of a sum of two convex functions, one typically a composition of non-smooth and linear functions. Examples include regression under structured sparsity assumptions. Popular algorithms for solving such problems, e.g., ADMM, often involve non-trivial optimization subproblems or smoothing approximation. We consider two classes of primal-dual algorithms that do not incur these difficulties, and unify them from a perspective of monotone operator theory. From this unification we propose a continuum of preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting algorithms amenable to parallel and distributed computing. For the entire region of convergence of the whole continuum of algorithms, we establish its rates of convergence. For some known instances of this continuum, our analysis closes the gap in theory. We further exploit the unification to propose a continuum of accelerated algorithms. We show that the whole continuum attains the theoretically optimal rate of convergence. The scalability of the proposed algorithms, as well as their convergence behavior, is demonstrated up to 1.2 million variables with a distributed implementation."}
{"text": "In this note we answer a question of G. Lecu\\'{e}, by showing that column normalization of a random matrix with iid entries need not lead to good sparse recovery properties, even if the generating random variable has a reasonable moment growth.

We show that if $m \\leq c_3\\sqrt{p}d^{1/p}$ and $\\tilde{\\Gamma}:R^d \\to R^m$ is the column-normalized matrix generated by $m$ independent copies of $X$, then with probability at least $1-2\\exp(-c_4m)$, $\\tilde{\\Gamma}$ does not satisfy the exact reconstruction property of order $2$."}
{"text": "We propose a unified framework to solve general low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery problems based on matrix factorization, which covers a broad family of objective functions satisfying the restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions. Based on projected gradient descent and the double thresholding operator, our proposed generic algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unknown low-rank and sparse matrices at a locally linear rate, while matching the best-known robustness guarantee (i.e., tolerance for sparsity). At the core of our theory is a novel structural Lipschitz gradient condition for low-rank plus sparse matrices, which is essential for proving the linear convergence rate of our algorithm, and we believe is of independent interest to prove fast rates for general superposition-structured models. We illustrate the application of our framework through two concrete examples: robust matrix sensing and robust PCA. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory."}
{"text": "Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods have been heavily exploited to analyse the association between two blocs of data. These powerful approaches can be applied to data sets where the number of variables is greater than the number of observations and in presence of high collinearity between variables. Different sparse versions of PLS have been developed to integrate multiple data sets while simultaneously selecting the contributing variables. Sparse modelling is a key factor in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between multiple data sets. The cornerstone of the sparsity version of PLS methods is the link between the SVD of a matrix (constructed from deflated versions of the original matrices of data) and least squares minimisation in linear regression. We present here an accurate description of the most popular PLS methods, alongside their mathematical proofs. A unified algorithm is proposed to perform all four types of PLS including their regularised versions. Various approaches to decrease the computation time are offered, and we show how the whole procedure can be scalable to big data sets."}
{"text": "In this paper, we propose PCKID, a novel, robust, kernel function for spectral clustering, specifically designed to handle incomplete data. By combining posterior distributions of Gaussian Mixture Models for incomplete data on different scales, we are able to learn a kernel for incomplete data that does not depend on any critical hyperparameters, unlike the commonly used RBF kernel. To evaluate our method, we perform experiments on two real datasets. PCKID outperforms the baseline methods for all fractions of missing values and in some cases outperforms the baseline methods with up to 25 percentage points."}
{"text": "Learning rates for least-squares regression are typically expressed in terms of $L_2$-norms. In this paper we extend these rates to norms stronger than the $L_2$-norm without requiring the regression function to be contained in the hypothesis space. In the special case of Sobolev reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces used as hypotheses spaces, these stronger norms coincide with fractional Sobolev norms between the used Sobolev space and $L_2$. As a consequence, not only the target function but also some of its derivatives can be estimated without changing the algorithm. From a technical point of view, we combine the well-known integral operator techniques with an embedding property, which so far has only been used in combination with empirical process arguments. This combination results in new finite sample bounds with respect to the stronger norms. From these finite sample bounds our rates easily follow. Finally, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our results in many cases."}
{"text": "We present an approach to deep estimation of discrete conditional probability distributions. Such models have several applications, including generative modeling of audio, image, and video data. Our approach combines two main techniques: dyadic partitioning and graph-based smoothing of the discrete space. By recursively decomposing each dimension into a series of binary splits and smoothing over the resulting distribution using graph-based trend filtering, we impose a strict structure to the model and achieve much higher sample efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model through a series of benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets, in some cases reducing the error by nearly half in comparison to other popular methods in the literature. All of our models are implemented in Tensorflow and publicly available at https://github.com/tansey/sdp ."}
{"text": "We consider the problem of estimating a regression function in the common situation where the number of features is small, where interpretability of the model is a high priority, and where simple linear or additive models fail to provide adequate performance. To address this problem, we present GapTV, an approach that is conceptually related both to CART and to the more recent CRISP algorithm, a state-of-the-art alternative method for interpretable nonlinear regression. GapTV divides the feature space into blocks of constant value and fits the value of all blocks jointly via a convex optimization routine. Our method is fully data-adaptive, in that it incorporates highly robust routines for tuning all hyperparameters automatically. We compare our approach against CART and CRISP and demonstrate that GapTV finds a much better trade-off between accuracy and interpretability."}
{"text": "Microwave-based breast cancer detection has been proposed as a complementary approach to compensate for some drawbacks of existing breast cancer detection techniques. Among the existing microwave breast cancer detection methods, machine learning-type algorithms have recently become more popular. These focus on detecting the existence of breast tumours rather than performing imaging to identify the exact tumour position. A key step of the machine learning approaches is feature extraction. One of the most widely used feature extraction method is principle component analysis (PCA). However, it can be sensitive to signal misalignment. This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based feature extraction method, which is more robust to the misalignment. Experimental results involving clinical data sets combined with numerically simulated tumour responses show that combined features from EMD and PCA improve the detection performance with an ensemble selection-based classifier."}
{"text": "We present a model for random simple graphs with a degree distribution that obeys a power law (i.e., is heavy-tailed). To attain this behavior, the edge probabilities in the graph are constructed from Bertoin-Fujita-Roynette-Yor (BFRY) random variables, which have been recently utilized in Bayesian statistics for the construction of power law models in several applications. Our construction readily extends to capture the structure of latent factors, similarly to stochastic blockmodels, while maintaining its power law degree distribution. The BFRY random variables are well approximated by gamma random variables in a variational Bayesian inference routine, which we apply to several network datasets for which power law degree distributions are a natural assumption. By learning the parameters of the BFRY distribution via probabilistic inference, we are able to automatically select the appropriate power law behavior from the data. In order to further scale our inference procedure, we adopt stochastic gradient ascent routines where the gradients are computed on minibatches (i.e., subsets) of the edges in the graph."}
{"text": "The pseudo-likelihood method is one of the most popular algorithms for learning sparse binary pairwise Markov networks. In this paper, we formulate the $L_1$ regularized pseudo-likelihood problem as a sparse multiple logistic regression problem. In this way, many insights and optimization procedures for sparse logistic regression can be applied to the learning of discrete Markov networks. Specifically, we use the coordinate descent algorithm for generalized linear models with convex penalties, combined with strong screening rules, to solve the pseudo-likelihood problem with $L_1$ regularization. Therefore a substantial speedup without losing any accuracy can be achieved. Furthermore, this method is more stable than the node-wise logistic regression approach on unbalanced high-dimensional data when penalized by small regularization parameters. Thorough numerical experiments on simulated data and real world data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method."}
{"text": "We introduce a novel kernel that models input-dependent couplings across multiple latent processes. The pairwise joint kernel measures covariance along inputs and across different latent signals in a mutually-dependent fashion. A latent correlation Gaussian process (LCGP) model combines these non-stationary latent components into multiple outputs by an input-dependent mixing matrix. Probit classification and support for multiple observation sets are derived by Variational Bayesian inference. Results on several datasets indicate that the LCGP model can recover the correlations between latent signals while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance. We highlight the latent covariances with an EEG classification dataset where latent brain processes and their couplings simultaneously emerge from the model."}
{"text": "Training Gaussian process-based models typically involves an $ O(N^3)$ computational bottleneck due to inverting the covariance matrix. Popular methods for overcoming this matrix inversion problem cannot adequately model all types of latent functions, and are often not parallelizable. However, judicious choice of model structure can ameliorate this problem. A mixture-of-experts model that uses a mixture of $K$ Gaussian processes offers modeling flexibility and opportunities for scalable inference. Our embarrassingly parallel algorithm combines low-dimensional matrix inversions with importance sampling to yield a flexible, scalable mixture-of-experts model that offers comparable performance to Gaussian process regression at a much lower computational cost."}
{"text": "We propose a novel method for semi-supervised learning (SSL) based on data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) using optimal transport metrics. Our proposed method enhances generalization error by using the unlabeled data to restrict the support of the worst case distribution in our DRO formulation. We enable the implementation of our DRO formulation by proposing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm which allows to easily implement the training procedure. We demonstrate that our Semi-supervised DRO method is able to improve the generalization error over natural supervised procedures and state-of-the-art SSL estimators. Finally, we include a discussion on the large sample behavior of the optimal uncertainty region in the DRO formulation. Our discussion exposes important aspects such as the role of dimension reduction in SSL."}
{"text": "We study a fundamental class of regression models called the second order linear model (SLM). The SLM extends the linear model to high order functional space and has attracted considerable research interest recently. Yet how to efficiently learn the SLM under full generality using nonconvex solver still remains an open question due to several fundamental limitations of the conventional gradient descent learning framework. In this study, we try to attack this problem from a gradient-free approach which we call the moment-estimation-sequence (MES) method. We show that the conventional gradient descent heuristic is biased by the skewness of the distribution therefore is no longer the best practice of learning the SLM. Based on the MES framework, we design a nonconvex alternating iteration process to train a $d$-dimension rank-$k$ SLM within $O(kd)$ memory and one-pass of the dataset. The proposed method converges globally and linearly, achieves $\\epsilon$ recovery error after retrieving $O[k^{2}d\\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(kd/\\epsilon)]$ samples. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals that not all SLMs can be learned on every sub-gaussian distribution. When the instances are sampled from a so-called $\\tau$-MIP distribution, the SLM can be learned by $O(p/\\tau^{2})$ samples where $p$ and $\\tau$ are positive constants depending on the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution. For non-MIP distribution, an addition diagonal-free oracle is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the learnability of the SLM. Numerical simulations verify the sharpness of our bounds on the sampling complexity and the linear convergence rate of our algorithm."}
{"text": "We consider a modification of the covariance function in Gaussian processes to correctly account for known linear constraints. By modelling the target function as a transformation of an underlying function, the constraints are explicitly incorporated in the model such that they are guaranteed to be fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. We also propose a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and illustrate the result on both simulated and real-data examples."}
{"text": "Computing partition function is the most important statistical inference task arising in applications of Graphical Models (GM). Since it is computationally intractable, approximate methods have been used to resolve the issue in practice, where mean-field (MF) and belief propagation (BP) are arguably the most popular and successful approaches of a variational type. In this paper, we propose two new variational schemes, coined Gauged-MF (G-MF) and Gauged-BP (G-BP), improving MF and BP, respectively. Both provide lower bounds for the partition function by utilizing the so-called gauge transformation which modifies factors of GM while keeping the partition function invariant. Moreover, we prove that both G-MF and G-BP are exact for GMs with a single loop of a special structure, even though the bare MF and BP perform badly in this case. Our extensive experiments, on complete GMs of relatively small size and on large GM (up-to 300 variables) confirm that the newly proposed algorithms outperform and generalize MF and BP."}
{"text": "This paper studies a new Bayesian algorithm for the joint reconstruction and classification of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images, with application to the identification of human skin lentigo. The proposed Bayesian approach takes advantage of the distribution of the multiplicative speckle noise affecting the true reflectivity of these images and of appropriate priors for the unknown model parameters. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the model parameters and the image of true reflectivity while classifying images according to the distribution of their reflectivity. Precisely, a Metropolis-whitin-Gibbs sampler is investigated to sample the posterior distribution of the Bayesian model associated with RCM images and to build estimators of its parameters, including labels indicating the class of each RCM image. The resulting algorithm is applied to synthetic data and to real images from a clinical study containing healthy and lentigo patients."}
{"text": "Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling."}
{"text": "Yield curve forecasting is an important problem in finance. In this work we explore the use of Gaussian Processes in conjunction with a dynamic modeling strategy, much like the Kalman Filter, to model the yield curve. Gaussian Processes have been successfully applied to model functional data in a variety of applications. A Gaussian Process is used to model the yield curve. The hyper-parameters of the Gaussian Process model are updated as the algorithm receives yield curve data. Yield curve data is typically available as a time series with a frequency of one day. We compare existing methods to forecast the yield curve with the proposed method. The results of this study showed that while a competing method (a multivariate time series method) performed well in forecasting the yields at the short term structure region of the yield curve, Gaussian Processes perform well in the medium and long term structure regions of the yield curve. Accuracy in the long term structure region of the yield curve has important practical implications. The Gaussian Process framework yields uncertainty and probability estimates directly in contrast to other competing methods. Analysts are frequently interested in this information. In this study the proposed method has been applied to yield curve forecasting, however it can be applied to model high frequency time series data or data streams in other domains."}
{"text": "We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines. Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense."}
{"text": "We study two procedures (reverse-mode and forward-mode) for computing the gradient of the validation error with respect to the hyperparameters of any iterative learning algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent. These procedures mirror two methods of computing gradients for recurrent neural networks and have different trade-offs in terms of running time and space requirements. Our formulation of the reverse-mode procedure is linked to previous work by Maclaurin et al. [2015] but does not require reversible dynamics. The forward-mode procedure is suitable for real-time hyperparameter updates, which may significantly speed up hyperparameter optimization on large datasets. We present experiments on data cleaning and on learning task interactions. We also present one large-scale experiment where the use of previous gradient-based methods would be prohibitive."}

First, we generate a diverse set of classification hypothesis using both Convolutional Neural Networks, currently the state-of-the-art technique for this task, among with other traditional and innovative machine learning techniques. Then, we optimally combine them through Meta-Nets, a family of recently developed and performing ensemble methods."}
{"text": "Deep generative models have been wildly successful at learning coherent latent representations for continuous data such as video and audio. However, generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions and molecular structures still poses significant challenges. Crucially, state-of-the-art methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which encodes and decodes directly to and from these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always valid. Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs, it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and molecular synthesis."}
{"text": "We discuss a Bayesian formulation to coarse-graining (CG) of PDEs where the coefficients (e.g. material parameters) exhibit random, fine scale variability. The direct solution to such problems requires grids that are small enough to resolve this fine scale variability which unavoidably requires the repeated solution of very large systems of algebraic equations. We establish a physically inspired, data-driven coarse-grained model which learns a low- dimensional set of microstructural features that are predictive of the fine-grained model (FG) response. Once learned, those features provide a sharp distribution over the coarse scale effec- tive coefficients of the PDE that are most suitable for prediction of the fine scale model output. This ultimately allows to replace the computationally expensive FG by a generative proba- bilistic model based on evaluating the much cheaper CG several times. Sparsity enforcing pri- ors further increase predictive efficiency and reveal microstructural features that are important in predicting the FG response. Moreover, the model yields probabilistic rather than single-point predictions, which enables the quantification of the unavoidable epistemic uncertainty that is present due to the information loss that occurs during the coarse-graining process."}
{"text": "The goal of the paper is to design sequential strategies which lead to efficient optimization of an unknown function under the only assumption that it has a finite Lipschitz constant. We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H\\\"older like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization."}
{"text": "We study dual volume sampling, a method for selecting k columns from an n x m short and wide matrix (n <= k <= m) such that the probability of selection is proportional to the volume spanned by the rows of the induced submatrix. This method was proposed by Avron and Boutsidis (2013), who showed it to be a promising method for column subset selection and its multiple applications. However, its wider adoption has been hampered by the lack of polynomial time sampling algorithms. We remove this hindrance by developing an exact (randomized) polynomial time sampling algorithm as well as its derandomization. Thereafter, we study dual volume sampling via the theory of real stable polynomials and prove that its distribution satisfies the \"Strong Rayleigh\" property. This result has numerous consequences, including a provably fast-mixing Markov chain sampler that makes dual volume sampling much more attractive to practitioners. This sampler is closely related to classical algorithms for popular experimental design methods that are to date lacking theoretical analysis but are known to empirically work well."}
{"text": "Density ratio estimation is a vital tool in both machine learning and statistical community. However, due to the unbounded nature of density ratio, the estimation procedure can be vulnerable to corrupted data points, which often pushes the estimated ratio toward infinity. In this paper, we present a robust estimator which automatically identifies and trims outliers. The proposed estimator has a convex formulation, and the global optimum can be obtained via subgradient descent. We analyze the parameter estimation error of this estimator under high-dimensional settings. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the estimator."}
{"text": "We present mlrMBO, a flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization (MBO), also known as Bayesian optimization, which addresses the problem of expensive black-box optimization by approximating the given objective function through a surrogate regression model. It is designed for both single- and multi-objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and conditional parameters. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal, parallelization, visualization, logging and error-handling. mlrMBO is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases, e.g., any regression learner from the mlr toolbox for machine learning can be used, and infill criteria and infill optimizers are easily exchangeable. We empirically demonstrate that mlrMBO provides state-of-the-art performance by comparing it on different benchmark scenarios against a wide range of other optimizers, including DiceOptim, rBayesianOptimization, SPOT, SMAC, Spearmint, and Hyperopt."}
{"text": "Indian Buffet Process based models are an elegant way for discovering underlying features within a data set, but inference in such models can be slow. Inferring underlying features using Markov chain Monte Carlo either relies on an uncollapsed representation, which leads to poor mixing, or on a collapsed representation, which leads to a quadratic increase in computational complexity. Existing attempts at distributing inference have introduced additional approximation within the inference procedure. In this paper we present a novel algorithm to perform asymptotically exact parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo inference for Indian Buffet Process models. We take advantage of the fact that the features are conditionally independent under the beta-Bernoulli process. Because of this conditional independence, we can partition the features into two parts: one part containing only the finitely many instantiated features and the other part containing the infinite tail of uninstantiated features. For the finite partition, parallel inference is simple given the instantiation of features. But for the infinite tail, performing uncollapsed MCMC leads to poor mixing and hence we collapse out the features. The resulting hybrid sampler, while being parallel, produces samples asymptotically from the true posterior."}
{"text": "We show that DBSCAN can estimate the connected components of the $\\lambda$-density level set $\\{ x : f(x) \\ge \\lambda\\}$ given $n$ i.i.d. samples from an unknown density $f$. We characterize the regularity of the level set boundaries using parameter $\\beta > 0$ and analyze the estimation error under the Hausdorff metric. When the data lies in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ we obtain a rate of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\\beta + D)})$, which matches known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. When the data lies on an embedded unknown $d$-dimensional manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, then we obtain a rate of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\\beta + d\\cdot \\max\\{1, \\beta \\})})$. Finally, we provide adaptive parameter tuning in order to attain these rates with no a priori knowledge of the intrinsic dimension, density, or $\\beta$."}
{"text": "The present study proposes a deep learning model, named DeepSleepNet, for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw single-channel EEG. Most of the existing methods rely on hand-engineered features which require prior knowledge of sleep analysis. Only a few of them encode the temporal information such as transition rules, which is important for identifying the next sleep stages, into the extracted features. In the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to extract time-invariant features, and bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory to learn transition rules among sleep stages automatically from EEG epochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm to train our model efficiently. We evaluated our model using different single-channel EEGs (F4-EOG(Left), Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) from two public sleep datasets, that have different properties (e.g., sampling rate) and scoring standards (AASM and R&K). The results showed that our model achieved similar overall accuracy and macro F1-score (MASS: 86.2%-81.7, Sleep-EDF: 82.0%-76.9) compared to the state-of-the-art methods (MASS: 85.9%-80.5, Sleep-EDF: 78.9%-73.7) on both datasets. This demonstrated that, without changing the model architecture and the training algorithm, our model could automatically learn features for sleep stage scoring from different raw single-channel EEGs from different datasets without utilizing any hand-engineered features."}
{"text": "We propose a novel Bayesian Optimization approach for black-box functions with an environmental variable whose value determines the tradeoff between evaluation cost and the fidelity of the evaluations. Further, we use a novel approach to sampling support points, allowing faster construction of the acquisition function. This allows us to achieve optimization with lower overheads than previous approaches and is implemented for a more general class of problem. We show this approach to be effective on synthetic and real world benchmark problems."}
{"text": "Gaussian process model for vector-valued function has been shown to be useful for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to re-formulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, re-formulation is not always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student$-t$ distribution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce a novel multivariate Student$-t$ process regression model (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and real data examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets."}
{"text": "We present a method for conditional time series forecasting based on an adaptation of the recent deep convolutional WaveNet architecture. The proposed network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad range of history when forecasting, a ReLU activation function and conditioning is performed by applying multiple convolutional filters in parallel to separate time series which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. We test and analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally as well as conditionally for financial time series forecasting using the S&P500, the volatility index, the CBOE interest rate and several exchange rates and extensively compare it to the performance of the well-known autoregressive model and a long-short term memory network. We show that a convolutional network is well-suited for regression-type problems and is able to effectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long historical time series, is a time-efficient and easy to implement alternative to recurrent-type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models."}
{"text": "We propose a probabilistic model to aggregate the answers of respondents answering multiple-choice questions. The model does not assume that everyone has access to the same information, and so does not assume that the consensus answer is correct. Instead, it infers the most probable world state, even if only a minority vote for it. Each respondent is modeled as receiving a signal contingent on the actual world state, and as using this signal to both determine their own answer and predict the answers given by others. By incorporating respondent's predictions of others' answers, the model infers latent parameters corresponding to the prior over world states and the probability of different signals being received in all possible world states, including counterfactual ones. Unlike other probabilistic models for aggregation, our model applies to both single and multiple questions, in which case it estimates each respondent's expertise. The model shows good performance, compared to a number of other probabilistic models, on data from seven studies covering different types of expertise."}
{"text": "The goal of data clustering is to partition data points into groups to minimize a given objective function. While most existing clustering algorithms treat each data point as vector, in many applications each datum is not a vector but a point pattern or a set of points. Moreover, many existing clustering methods require the user to specify the number of clusters, which is not available in advance. This paper proposes a new class of models for data clustering that addresses set-valued data as well as unknown number of clusters, using a Dirichlet Process mixture of Poisson random finite sets. We also develop an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior inference technique that can learn the number of clusters and mixture parameters automatically from the data. Numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the salient features of this new model, in particular its capacity to discover extremely unbalanced clusters in data."}
{"text": "We propose a data aggregation-based algorithm with monotonic convergence to a global optimum for a generalized version of the L1-norm error fitting model with an assumption of the fitting function. The proposed algorithm generalizes the recent algorithm in the literature, aggregate and iterative disaggregate (AID), which selectively solves three specific L1-norm error fitting problems. With the proposed algorithm, any L1-norm error fitting model can be solved optimally if it follows the form of the L1-norm error fitting problem and if the fitting function satisfies the assumption. The proposed algorithm can also solve multi-dimensional fitting problems with arbitrary constraints on the fitting coefficients matrix. The generalized problem includes popular models such as regression and the orthogonal Procrustes problem. The results of the computational experiment show that the proposed algorithms are faster than the state-of-the-art benchmarks for L1-norm regression subset selection and L1-norm regression over a sphere. Further, the relative performance of the proposed algorithm improves as data size increases."}
{"text": "This work addresses various open questions in the theory of active learning for nonparametric classification. Our contributions are both statistical and algorithmic: -We establish new minimax-rates for active learning under common \\textit{noise conditions}. These rates display interesting transitions -- due to the interaction between noise \\textit{smoothness and margin} -- not present in the passive setting. Some such transitions were previously conjectured, but remained unconfirmed. -We present a generic algorithmic strategy for adaptivity to unknown noise smoothness and margin; our strategy achieves optimal rates in many general situations; furthermore, unlike in previous work, we avoid the need for \\textit{adaptive confidence sets}, resulting in strictly milder distributional requirements."}
{"text": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning is one of the most popular methods in machine learning. Some of its theoretical properties such as bounds for the generalization error and the convergence of the graph Laplacian regularizer have been studied in computer science and statistics literatures. However, a fundamental statistical property, the consistency of the estimator from this method has not been proved. In this article, we study the consistency problem under a non-parametric framework. We prove the consistency of graph-based learning in the case that the estimated scores are enforced to be equal to the observed responses for the labeled data. The sample sizes of both labeled and unlabeled data are allowed to grow in this result. When the estimated scores are not required to be equal to the observed responses, a tuning parameter is used to balance the loss function and the graph Laplacian regularizer. We give a counterexample demonstrating that the estimator for this case can be inconsistent. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies."}
{"text": "Bandit methods for black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation, are used in a variety of applications including hyper-parameter tuning and experiment design. Recently, \\emph{multi-fidelity} methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. In many practical applications however, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space $(N,T)$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments."}

We provide an overview over the state-of-the-art in coreset construction for machine learning. In Section 2, we present both the intuition behind and a theoretically sound framework to construct coresets for general problems and apply it to $k$-means clustering. In Section 3 we summarize existing coreset construction algorithms for a variety of machine learning problems such as maximum likelihood estimation of mixture models, Bayesian non-parametric models, principal component analysis, regression and general empirical risk minimization."}
{"text": "The massive amount of available data potentially used to discover patters in machine learning is a challenge for kernel based algorithms with respect to runtime and storage capacities. Local approaches might help to relieve these issues. From a statistical point of view local approaches allow additionally to deal with different structures in the data in different ways. This paper analyses properties of localized kernel based, non-parametric statistical machine learning methods, in particular of support vector machines (SVMs) and methods close to them. We will show there that locally learnt kernel methods are universal consistent. Furthermore, we give an upper bound for the maxbias in order to show statistical robustness of the proposed method."}
{"text": "Kernel embeddings of distributions and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), the resulting distance between distributions, are useful tools for fully nonparametric two-sample testing and learning on distributions. However, it is rarely that all possible differences between samples are of interest -- discovered differences can be due to different types of measurement noise, data collection artefacts or other irrelevant sources of variability. We propose distances between distributions which encode invariance to additive symmetric noise, aimed at testing whether the assumed true underlying processes differ. Moreover, we construct invariant features of distributions, leading to learning algorithms robust to the impairment of the input distributions with symmetric additive noise."}
{"text": "We present the first treatment of the arc length of the Gaussian Process (GP) with more than a single output dimension. GPs are commonly used for tasks such as trajectory modelling, where path length is a crucial quantity of interest. Previously, only paths in one dimension have been considered, with no theoretical consideration of higher dimensional problems. We fill the gap in the existing literature by deriving the moments of the arc length for a stationary GP with multiple output dimensions. A new method is used to derive the mean of a one-dimensional GP over a finite interval, by considering the distribution of the arc length integrand. This technique is used to derive an approximate distribution over the arc length of a vector valued GP in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by moment matching the distribution. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical derivations."}
{"text": "The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has recently been successfully applied in robust regression, classification and adaptive filtering, where the correntropy is maximized instead of minimizing the well-known mean square error (MSE) to improve the robustness with respect to outliers (or impulsive noises). Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop various robust adaptive algorithms under MCC, but so far little insight has been gained as to how the optimal solution will be affected by outliers. In this work, we study this problem in the context of parameter estimation for a simple linear errors-in-variables (EIV) model where all variables are scalar. Under certain conditions, we derive an upper bound on the absolute value of the estimation error and show that the optimal solution under MCC can be very close to the true value of the unknown parameter even with outliers (whose values can be arbitrarily large) in both input and output variables. Illustrative examples are presented to verify and clarify the theory."}
{"text": "Inferring the correct answers to binary tasks based on multiple noisy answers in an unsupervised manner has emerged as the canonical question for micro-task crowdsourcing or more generally aggregating opinions. In graphon estimation, one is interested in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes using a single snapshot of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from graphon estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than the {\\em majority voting} scheme for a setup that goes beyond the {\\em rank one} models considered in the literature. We use known explicit lower bounds for crowdsourcing to provide refined lower bounds for graphon estimation."}
{"text": "How can we train a statistical mixture model on a massive data set? In this work we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians. A coreset is a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models fitting the coreset also provide a good fit for the original data set. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size polynomial in dimension and the number of mixture components, while being independent of the data set size. Hence, one can harness computationally intensive algorithms to compute a good approximation on a significantly smaller data set. More importantly, such coresets can be efficiently constructed both in distributed and streaming settings and do not impose restrictions on the data generating process. Our results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in computational geometry and new combinatorial complexity results for mixtures of Gaussians. Empirical evaluation on several real-world datasets suggests that our coreset-based approach enables significant reduction in training-time with negligible approximation error."}
{"text": "There is growing interest in applying machine learning methods to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Across different institutions, however, EMR quality can vary widely. This work investigated the impact of this disparity on the performance of three advanced machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and recurrent neural network. The EMR disparity was emulated using different permutations of the EMR collected at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU). The algorithms were trained using patients from the PICU to predict in-ICU mortality for patients in a held out set of PICU and CTICU patients. The disparate patient populations between the PICU and CTICU provide an estimate of generalization errors across different ICUs. We quantified and evaluated the generalization of these algorithms on varying EMR size, input types, and fidelity of data."}
{"text": "This paper deals with the problem of large-scale linear supervised learning in settings where a large number of continuous features are available. We propose to combine the well-known trick of one-hot encoding of continuous features with a new penalization called \\emph{binarsity}. In each group of binary features coming from the one-hot encoding of a single raw continuous feature, this penalization uses total-variation regularization together with an extra linear constraint. This induces two interesting properties on the model weights of the one-hot encoded features: they are piecewise constant, and are eventually block sparse. Non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for generalized linear models are proposed. Moreover, under a sparse additive model assumption, we prove that our procedure matches the state-of-the-art in this setting. Numerical experiments illustrate the good performances of our approach on several datasets. It is also noteworthy that our method has a numerical complexity comparable to standard $\\ell_1$ penalization."}
{"text": "Integrating visual and linguistic information into a single multimodal representation is an unsolved problem with wide-reaching applications to both natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we present a simple method to build multimodal representations by learning a language-to-vision mapping and using its output to build multimodal embeddings. In this sense, our method provides a cognitively plausible way of building representations, consistent with the inherently re-constructive and associative nature of human memory. Using seven benchmark concept similarity tests we show that the mapped vectors not only implicitly encode multimodal information, but also outperform strong unimodal baselines and state-of-the-art multimodal methods, thus exhibiting more \"human-like\" judgments---particularly in zero-shot settings."}
{"text": "Existing strategies for finite-armed stochastic bandits mostly depend on a parameter of scale that must be known in advance. Sometimes this is in the form of a bound on the payoffs, or the knowledge of a variance or subgaussian parameter. The notable exceptions are the analysis of Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance by Cowan and Katehakis [2015] and of uniform distributions with unknown support [Cowan and Katehakis, 2015]. The results derived in these specialised cases are generalised here to the non-parametric setup, where the learner knows only a bound on the kurtosis of the noise, which is a scale free measure of the extremity of outliers."}
{"text": "We consider the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in linear quadratic (LQ) control problems, where the state dynamics is linear and the cost function is quadratic in states and controls. We analyze the regret of Thompson sampling (TS) (a.k.a. posterior-sampling for reinforcement learning) in the frequentist setting, i.e., when the parameters characterizing the LQ dynamics are fixed. Despite the empirical and theoretical success in a wide range of problems from multi-armed bandit to linear bandit, we show that when studying the frequentist regret TS in control problems, we need to trade-off the frequency of sampling optimistic parameters and the frequency of switches in the control policy. This results in an overall regret of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is significantly worse than the regret $O(\\sqrt{T})$ achieved by the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty algorithm in LQ control problems."}
{"text": "We implemented several multilabel classification algorithms in the machine learning package mlr. The implemented methods are binary relevance, classifier chains, nested stacking, dependent binary relevance and stacking, which can be used with any base learner that is accessible in mlr. Moreover, there is access to the multilabel classification versions of randomForestSRC and rFerns. All these methods can be easily compared by different implemented multilabel performance measures and resampling methods in the standardized mlr framework. In a benchmark experiment with several multilabel datasets, the performance of the different methods is evaluated."}
{"text": "In the scenario of real-time monitoring of hospital patients, high-quality inference of patients' health status using all information available from clinical covariates and lab tests is essential to enable successful medical interventions and improve patient outcomes. Developing a computational framework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) and make accurate real-time predictions is a critical step. In this work, we develop and explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on Gaussian process (GP) regression for hospital patient monitoring. We propose MedGP, a statistical framework that incorporates 24 clinical and lab covariates and supports a rich reference data set from which relationships between observed covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of patient state over time. To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP kernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points while estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and periodicity in patient observations. MedGP has a number of benefits over current methods, including (i) not requiring an alignment of the time series data, (ii) quantifying confidence regions in the predictions, (iii) exploiting a vast and rich database of patients, and (iv) inferring interpretable relationships among clinical covariates. We evaluate and compare results from MedGP on the task of online prediction for three patient subgroups from two medical data sets across 8,043 patients. We found MedGP improves online prediction over baseline methods for nearly all covariates across different disease subgroups and studies. The publicly available code is at https://github.com/bee-hive/MedGP."}
{"text": "The development of computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction methods that significantly reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining high image quality is an important area of research in low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging. We propose a new penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) reconstruction method that exploits regularization based on an efficient Union of Learned TRAnsforms (PWLS-ULTRA). The union of square transforms is pre-learned from numerous image patches extracted from a dataset of CT images or volumes. The proposed PWLS-based cost function is optimized by alternating between a CT image reconstruction step, and a sparse coding and clustering step. The CT image reconstruction step is accelerated by a relaxed linearized augmented Lagrangian method with ordered-subsets that reduces the number of forward and back projections. Simulations with 2-D and 3-D axial CT scans of the extended cardiac-torso phantom and 3D helical chest and abdomen scans show that for both normal-dose and low-dose levels, the proposed method significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images compared to PWLS reconstruction with a nonadaptive edge-preserving regularizer (PWLS-EP). PWLS with regularization based on a union of learned transforms leads to better image reconstructions than using a single learned square transform. We also incorporate patch-based weights in PWLS-ULTRA that enhance image quality and help improve image resolution uniformity. The proposed approach achieves comparable or better image quality compared to learned overcomplete synthesis dictionaries, but importantly, is much faster (computationally more efficient)."}
{"text": "Objectives: Discussions of fairness in criminal justice risk assessments typically lack conceptual precision. Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this paper, we seek to clarify the tradeoffs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy.   Methods: We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments.   Results: We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy.   Conclusions: Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time, and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging tradeoffs."}
{"text": "Analyzing multivariate time series data is important to predict future events and changes of complex systems in finance, manufacturing, and administrative decisions. The expressiveness power of Gaussian Process (GP) regression methods has been significantly improved by compositional covariance structures. In this paper, we present a new GP model which naturally handles multiple time series by placing an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior on the presence of shared kernels. Our selective covariance structure decomposition allows exploiting shared parameters over a set of multiple, selected time series. We also investigate the well-definedness of the models when infinite latent components are introduced. We present a pragmatic search algorithm which explores a larger structure space efficiently. Experiments conducted on five real-world data sets demonstrate that our new model outperforms existing methods in term of structure discoveries and predictive performances."}
{"text": "We consider a generalization of low-rank matrix completion to the case where the data belongs to an algebraic variety, i.e. each data point is a solution to a system of polynomial equations. In this case the original matrix is possibly high-rank, but it becomes low-rank after mapping each column to a higher dimensional space of monomial features. Many well-studied extensions of linear models, including affine subspaces and their union, can be described by a variety model. In addition, varieties can be used to model a richer class of nonlinear quadratic and higher degree curves and surfaces. We study the sampling requirements for matrix completion under a variety model with a focus on a union of affine subspaces. We also propose an efficient matrix completion algorithm that minimizes a convex or non-convex surrogate of the rank of the matrix of monomial features. Our algorithm uses the well-known \"kernel trick\" to avoid working directly with the high-dimensional monomial matrix. We show the proposed algorithm is able to recover synthetically generated data up to the predicted sampling complexity bounds. The proposed algorithm also outperforms standard low rank matrix completion and subspace clustering techniques in experiments with real data."}
{"text": "In high-dimensional and/or non-parametric regression problems, regularization (or penalization) is used to control model complexity and induce desired structure. Each penalty has a weight parameter that indicates how strongly the structure corresponding to that penalty should be enforced. Typically the parameters are chosen to minimize the error on a separate validation set using a simple grid search or a gradient-free optimization method. It is more efficient to tune parameters if the gradient can be determined, but this is often difficult for problems with non-smooth penalty functions. Here we show that for many penalized regression problems, the validation loss is actually smooth almost-everywhere with respect to the penalty parameters. We can therefore apply a modified gradient descent algorithm to tune parameters. Through simulation studies on example regression problems, we find that increasing the number of penalty parameters and tuning them using our method can decrease the generalization error."}
{"text": "Spectral clustering is a popular and versatile clustering method based on a relaxation of the normalised graph cut objective. Despite its popularity, however, there is no single agreed upon method for tuning the important scaling parameter, nor for determining automatically the number of clusters to extract. Popular heuristics exist, but corresponding theoretical results are scarce. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic value of the normalised cut for an increasing sample assumed to arise from an underlying probability distribution, and based on this result provide recommendations for improving spectral clustering methodology. A corresponding algorithm is proposed with strong empirical performance."}
{"text": "The trade-off between the cost of acquiring and processing data, and uncertainty due to a lack of data is fundamental in machine learning. A basic instance of this trade-off is the problem of deciding when to make noisy and costly observations of a discrete-time Gaussian random walk, so as to minimise the posterior variance plus observation costs. We present the first proof that a simple policy, which observes when the posterior variance exceeds a threshold, is optimal for this problem. The proof generalises to a wide range of cost functions other than the posterior variance.   This result implies that optimal policies for linear-quadratic-Gaussian control with costly observations have a threshold structure. It also implies that the restless bandit problem of observing multiple such time series, has a well-defined Whittle index. We discuss computation of that index, give closed-form formulae for it, and compare the performance of the associated index policy with heuristic policies.   The proof is based on a new verification theorem that demonstrates threshold structure for Markov decision processes, and on the relation between binary sequences known as mechanical words and the dynamics of discontinuous nonlinear maps, which frequently arise in physics, control and biology."}
{"text": "Objective: In this work, we perform margin assessment of human breast tissue from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using deep neural networks (DNNs). This work simulates an intraoperative setting for breast cancer lumpectomy. Methods: To train the DNNs, we use both the state-of-the-art methods (Weight Decay and DropOut) and a newly introduced regularization method based on function norms. Commonly used methods can fail when only a small database is available. The use of a function norm introduces a direct control over the complexity of the function with the aim of diminishing the risk of overfitting. Results: As neither the code nor the data of previous results are publicly available, the obtained results are compared with reported results in the literature for a conservative comparison. Moreover, our method is applied to locally collected data on several data configurations. The reported results are the average over the different trials. Conclusion: The experimental results show that the use of DNNs yields significantly better results than other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, G-mean and Matthews correlation coefficient. Function norm regularization yielded higher and more robust results than competing methods. Significance: We have demonstrated a system that shows high promise for (partially) automated margin assessment of human breast tissue, Equal error rate (EER) is reduced from approximately 12\\% (the lowest reported in the literature) to 5\\%\\,--\\,a 58\\% reduction. The method is computationally feasible for intraoperative application (less than 2 seconds per image)."}
{"text": "Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results."}
{"text": "Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 - 2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers."}
{"text": "An exciting branch of machine learning research focuses on methods for learning, optimizing, and integrating unknown functions that are difficult or costly to evaluate. A popular Bayesian approach to this problem uses a Gaussian process (GP) to construct a posterior distribution over the function of interest given a set of observed measurements, and selects new points to evaluate using the statistics of this posterior. Here we extend these methods to exploit derivative information from the unknown function. We describe methods for Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian quadrature (BQ) in settings where first and second derivatives may be evaluated along with the function itself. We perform sampling-based inference in order to incorporate uncertainty over hyperparameters, and show that both hyperparameter and function uncertainty decrease much more rapidly when using derivative information. Moreover, we introduce techniques for overcoming ill-conditioning issues that have plagued earlier methods for gradient-enhanced Gaussian processes and kriging. We illustrate the efficacy of these methods using applications to real and simulated Bayesian optimization and quadrature problems, and show that exploting derivatives can provide substantial gains over standard methods."}
{"text": "To ensure interpretability of extracted sources in tensor decomposition, we introduce in this paper a dictionary-based tensor canonical polyadic decomposition which enforces one factor to belong exactly to a known dictionary. A new formulation of sparse coding is proposed which enables high dimensional tensors dictionary-based canonical polyadic decomposition. The benefits of using a dictionary in tensor decomposition models are explored both in terms of parameter identifiability and estimation accuracy. Performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated on the decomposition of simulated data and the unmixing of hyperspectral images."}
{"text": "It has recently been shown that many of the existing quasi-Newton algorithms can be formulated as learning algorithms, capable of learning local models of the cost functions. Importantly, this understanding allows us to safely start assembling probabilistic Newton-type algorithms, applicable in situations where we only have access to noisy observations of the cost function and its derivatives. This is where our interest lies.   We make contributions to the use of the non-parametric and probabilistic Gaussian process models in solving these stochastic optimisation problems. Specifically, we present a new algorithm that unites these approximations together with recent probabilistic line search routines to deliver a probabilistic quasi-Newton approach.   We also show that the probabilistic optimisation algorithms deliver promising results on challenging nonlinear system identification problems where the very nature of the problem is such that we can only access the cost function and its derivative via noisy observations, since there are no closed-form expressions available."}
{"text": "We study a model where one target variable Y is correlated with a vector X:=(X_1,...,X_d) of predictor variables being potential causes of Y. We describe a method that infers to what extent the statistical dependences between X and Y are due to the influence of X on Y and to what extent due to a hidden common cause (confounder) of X and Y. The method relies on concentration of measure results for large dimensions d and an independence assumption stating that, in the absence of confounding, the vector of regression coefficients describing the influence of each X on Y typically has `generic orientation' relative to the eigenspaces of the covariance matrix of X. For the special case of a scalar confounder we show that confounding typically spoils this generic orientation in a characteristic way that can be used to quantitatively estimate the amount of confounding."}
{"text": "Cluster analysis of very high dimensional data can benefit from the properties of such high dimensionality. Informally expressed, in this work, our focus is on the analogous situation when the dimensionality is moderate to small, relative to a massively sized set of observations. Mathematically expressed, these are the dual spaces of observations and attributes. The point cloud of observations is in attribute space, and the point cloud of attributes is in observation space. In this paper, we begin by summarizing various perspectives related to methodologies that are used in multivariate analytics. We draw on these to establish an efficient clustering processing pipeline, both partitioning and hierarchical clustering."}
{"text": "Integrative analysis of disparate data blocks measured on a common set of experimental subjects is a major challenge in modern data analysis. This data structure naturally motivates the simultaneous exploration of the joint and individual variation within each data block resulting in new insights. For instance, there is a strong desire to integrate the multiple genomic data sets in The Cancer Genome Atlas to characterize the common and also the unique aspects of cancer genetics and cell biology for each source. In this paper we introduce Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained capturing both joint and individual variation within each data block. This is a major improvement over earlier approaches to this challenge in terms of a new conceptual understanding, much better adaption to data heterogeneity and a fast linear algebra computation. Important mathematical contributions are the use of score subspaces as the principal descriptors of variation structure and the use of perturbation theory as the guide for variation segmentation. This leads to an exploratory data analysis method which is insensitive to the heterogeneity among data blocks and does not require separate normalization. An application to cancer data reveals different behaviors of each type of signal in characterizing tumor subtypes. An application to a mortality data set reveals interesting historical lessons.

{"text": "The \"least absolute shrinkage and selection operator\" (Lasso) method has been adapted recently for networkstructured datasets. In particular, this network Lasso method allows to learn graph signals from a small number of noisy signal samples by using the total variation of a graph signal for regularization. While efficient and scalable implementations of the network Lasso are available, only little is known about the conditions on the underlying network structure which ensure network Lasso to be accurate. By leveraging concepts of compressed sensing, we address this gap and derive precise conditions on the underlying network topology and sampling set which guarantee the network Lasso for a particular loss function to deliver an accurate estimate of the entire underlying graph signal. We also quantify the error incurred by network Lasso in terms of two constants which reflect the connectivity of the sampled nodes."}
{"text": "Super-resolution is a classical problem in image processing, with numerous applications to remote sensing image enhancement. Here, we address the super-resolution of irregularly-sampled remote sensing images. Using an optimal interpolation as the low-resolution reconstruction, we explore locally-adapted multimodal convolutional models and investigate different dictionary-based decompositions, namely based on principal component analysis (PCA), sparse priors and non-negativity constraints. We consider an application to the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) fields from two information sources, along-track altimeter data and sea surface temperature (SST) data. The reported experiments demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model, especially locally-adapted parametrizations with non-negativity constraints, to outperform optimally-interpolated reconstructions."}
{"text": "The Temporal Group LASSO is an example of a multi-task, regularized regression approach for the prediction of response variables that vary over time. The aim of this work is to introduce the reader to the concepts behind the Temporal Group LASSO and its related methods, as well as to the type of potential applications in a healthcare setting that the method has. We argue that the method is attractive because of its ability to reduce overfitting, select predictors, learn smooth effect patterns over time, and finally, its simplicity"}
{"text": "This paper describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which, with interactive graphics, can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this paper, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using the ggplot2, plotly, and shiny packages."}
{"text": "In this paper we study the problem of noisy tensor completion for tensors that admit a canonical polyadic or CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition with one of the factors being sparse. We present general theoretical error bounds for an estimate obtained by using a complexity-regularized maximum likelihood principle and then instantiate these bounds for the case of additive white Gaussian noise. We also provide an ADMM-type algorithm for solving the complexity-regularized maximum likelihood problem and validate the theoretical finding via experiments on synthetic data set."}
{"text": "We study strictly proper scoring rules in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We propose a general Kernel Scoring rule and associated Kernel Divergence. We consider conditions under which the Kernel Score is strictly proper. We then demonstrate that the Kernel Score includes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy as a special case. We also consider the connections between the Kernel Score and the minimum risk of a proper loss function. We show that the Kernel Score incorporates more information pertaining to the projected embedded distributions compared to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Finally, we show how to integrate the information provided from different Kernel Divergences, such as the proposed Bhattacharyya Kernel Divergence, using a one-class classifier for improved two-sample hypothesis testing results."}
{"text": "Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals."}
{"text": "The standard interpretation of importance-weighted autoencoders is that they maximize a tighter lower bound on the marginal likelihood than the standard evidence lower bound. We give an alternate interpretation of this procedure: that it optimizes the standard variational lower bound, but using a more complex distribution. We formally derive this result, present a tighter lower bound, and visualize the implicit importance-weighted distribution."}
{"text": "Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged during the last few years as an effective approach to optimizing black-box functions where direct queries of the objective are expensive. In this paper we consider the case where direct access to the function is not possible, but information about user preferences is. Such scenarios arise in problems where human preferences are modeled, such as A/B tests or recommender systems. We present a new framework for this scenario that we call Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) which allows us to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be queried through pairwise comparisons, the so-called duels. PBO extends the applicability of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by modeling the probability of the winner of each duel by means of a Gaussian process model with a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO. We illustrate the benefits of PBO in a variety of experiments, showing that PBO needs drastically fewer comparisons for finding the optimum. According to our experiments, the way of modeling correlations in PBO is key in obtaining this advantage."}
{"text": "Matrix factorisation methods decompose multivariate observations as linear combinations of latent feature vectors. The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) provides a way to model the number of latent features required for a good approximation in terms of regularised reconstruction error. Previous work has focussed on latent feature vectors with independent entries. We extend the model to include nondiagonal latent covariance structures representing characteristics such as smoothness. This is done by . Using simulations we demonstrate that under appropriate conditions a smoothness prior helps to recover the true latent features, while denoising more accurately. We demonstrate our method on a real neuroimaging dataset, where computational tractability is a sufficient challenge that the efficient strategy presented here is essential."}
{"text": "The Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm has been widely used in solving nuclear norm constrained problems, since it does not require projections. However, FW often yields high rank intermediate iterates, which can be very expensive in time and space costs for large problems. To address this issue, we propose a rank-drop method for nuclear norm constrained problems. The goal is to generate descent steps that lead to rank decreases, maintaining low-rank solutions throughout the algorithm. Moreover, the optimization problems are constrained to ensure that the rank-drop step is also feasible and can be readily incorporated into a projection-free minimization method, e.g., Frank-Wolfe. We demonstrate that by incorporating rank-drop steps into the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the rank of the solution is greatly reduced compared to the original Frank-Wolfe or its common variants."}
{"text": "We show that $k$-means (Lloyd's algorithm) is obtained as a special case when truncated variational EM approximations are applied to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with isotropic Gaussians. In contrast to the standard way to relate $k$-means and GMMs, the provided derivation shows that it is not required to consider Gaussians with small variances or the limit case of zero variances. There are a number of consequences that directly follow from our approach: (A) $k$-means can be shown to increase a free energy associated with truncated distributions and this free energy can directly be reformulated in terms of the $k$-means objective; (B) $k$-means generalizations can directly be derived by considering the 2nd closest, 3rd closest etc. cluster in addition to just the closest one; and (C) the embedding of $k$-means into a free energy framework allows for theoretical interpretations of other $k$-means generalizations in the literature. In general, truncated variational EM provides a natural and rigorous quantitative link between $k$-means-like clustering and GMM clustering algorithms which may be very relevant for future theoretical and empirical studies."}
